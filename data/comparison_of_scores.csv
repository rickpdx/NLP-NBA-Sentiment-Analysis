pos,Pos,giannis is the timeline where shaq learns to free throw
pos,Pos,6 straight losses in milwaukee glad to be done playing this fucking team for a while
neg,Pos,can t believe kd and harden are leading the lowest scoring offense in the nba this year
neg,Pos,i ll admit it i fear the deer
neg,Neg,i m just here to talk about jordan nwora donte divincenzo might be in trouble
pos,Pos,props to ian eagle for getting hyped over bucks plays
pos,Pos,bud switching it up a lot giannis ft shooting looks way better grayson and nwora looking great bucks look scarier despite losing tucker and having jrue out early
pos,Pos,dare i say we look even better
pos,Pos,i have concluded that patty mills is the greatest 3 point shooter of all time
pos,Pos,harden needs to score more without kyrie
pos,Pos,all i want to say is that it feels damn good to have ian eagle and svg paired up on commentary again they were my favorite national commentary duo during the bubble and it wasn t the same without him last year thank you pelicans for letting him go
neg,Pos,is no one talking about patty mills becoming a laser going 7 7 from deep
pos,Neg,giannis will get all the praise and deservedly so but connaughton and nwora were the unsung heroes of this game for mil also shout out to patty mills dude played his ass off
pos,Neg,somehow this is an average giannis game
neg,Pos,if that new shooting form is for real i don t know how you could argue anyone else is the player in the league
neg,Pos,kd after the season opening loss say kyrie how do you really feel about getting vaccinated
pos,Pos,so who is brooklyn drafting with the first pick
pos,Pos,giannis 32 7 14 in 31 minutes 7 9 from the line 3rd mvp szn incoming
pos,Pos,planet pat was on point tonight
pos,Pos,our bench scored only 25 points and in that patty put up 21 lmao
pos,Pos,all board the nwora bandwagon chooo chooo
pos,Neg,35m over the tax just to get smacked by a long greek boi
neg,Neg,fuck we made the mistake of underestimating the bucks again
pos,Pos,championtumpko hit different
pos,Pos,is this your king
neg,Neg,bucks are scary as fuck
pos,Neg,great game by giannis man can he really take his game to another level looks insane this evening
pos,Pos,patty mills can t win with these cats
pos,Pos,jordan nwora and patty mills played like they just got off the plane from the oympics
pos,Pos,good win bucks yall looked great way to remind people that the championship goes through milwaukee that being said i don t think tonight s game should worry anyone or really give anyone confidence we knew these were the top to teams in the east that hasn t changed most these hot takes based off 48min in october won t age well
pos,Pos,bucks good
pos,Pos,i don t want to be reactionary but we re repeating and giannis is winning his third mvp
pos,Pos,it s still very very early but it feels like grayson allen has been in the team for a couple of years i really like his energy and attitude in other news giannis is doing giannis things as for the nets i don t care if you re missing michael jordan himself you can t be shooting 60 from 3 and barely put up a fight
pos,Pos,nets about to call kyrie and say they ok with that part time agreement
pos,Pos,i m ready to overreact
neg,Neg,nets have the worst record in the league
pos,Neg,i gotta say it seemed like the game flowed really and that the refs let both teams play seems like the rule changes and offensive stuff worked i liked this game
pos,Pos,yeah they might have to force kyrie to take the vaccine
pos,Pos,giannis looked good with his ft shooting and his mid range
neg,Pos,you taking that damn vaccine kai
neg,Neg,what if game 6 of the finals was the worst game of the rest of giannis career
pos,Pos,damn i hope jrue doesnt miss much time if at all
pos,Pos,i think giannis got better the bucks look great per usual head scratching rotations by nash tonight as he tries to figure out this roster claxton and harris have to play better against this bucks team which is no guarantee the team might need a secondary creator with kyrie gone a little too one dimensional out there overall good game
pos,Pos,if morey s smart he ll trade ben for patty mills immediately
pos,Pos,giannis antetokounmpo seems like he might turn out to be a decent player
neg,Pos,pat had a silent 20 i didn t realize he scored that much but damn was he so explosive today
pos,Pos,82 0
neg,Pos,i swear if patty was given the ball more in the first two quarters nets wouldnt have dug themselves in that hole so early dude was firing on all cylinders i think its nash s fault they couldnt figure out and damn nwora was out for blood today lol
pos,Neg,u bigbadbuck remember when you said you were ready for this game so it would shut all the bucks fans up or this comment you made earlier lets fucking remind these chumps who runs the east
pos,Pos,texbook blowout nets didn t look good bucks looked like true contenders with a team that plays together even after jrue left with a heel contusion the nets offense was simply give ball to durant harden hope it works their stars had low energy and settled for contested jumpers throughout patty mills is the only reason they didn t lose by thirty
pos,Pos,championship stuff from milwaukee nets just don t have chemistry still
neg,Neg,giving up down 14 with over 3 30 left yo not a nets fan but i was screaming at the tv it s opening night your against the champs national tv you have harden and durant 2 threes each and it s a new game but no mas let s throw in the towel i don t get that at all
pos,Pos,happy deer noises
pos,Pos,where were you when jordan nwora became goated
pos,Pos,so glad nba is back thank you ben for carrying the offseason time has passed quickly
neg,Pos,giannis even better fuck
pos,Pos,i for one am ready to overreact seriously though the bucks looked amazing giannis is nuts
pos,Pos,not to overreact but bucks going back to back this year edit not to overreact again but after watching the warriors beat the lakers the warriors are going to go 82 0 in the regular season and 16 0 in the playoffs
neg,Pos,bucks heard the disrespect and said fuck that lol
neg,Neg,7 9 ft league fucked
neg,Neg,can t blame this loss on one player the whole team other than patty and kd were pretty bad chemistry definitely needs some work also giannis is fucking unreal
neg,Neg,i don t think giannis likes harden harden may never win in the east with him around
neg,Pos,i don t want to overreact but i think the nets aren t making the playoffs
neg,Pos,seems like the nets were trying out different lineups and figuring it out vs the bucks who were straight up gelling most of the game continuity is very important and a chip really does change a team s demeanor that showed tonight i know it s the first game but it s so hard to not overreact lol
neg,Pos,bucks look deep as hell nets struggled to score at the rim around giannis and lopez don t know if they have an answer for the bucks size right now will be interesting to see how they deal with that as the season progresses
pos,Pos,lol they gon need kyrie
pos,Pos,i expected milwaukee to win but i didn t think it d be a blowout
pos,Pos,giannis with 32 points in 30 min a bud masterclass
pos,Pos,we look good
pos,Neg,claxton impact this game was non existent same with alridge and company
pos,Pos,nets fans and telling you to just wait until they have all their players name a more dynamic duo
pos,Pos,michael jordan nwora over ere
pos,Pos,dis anyone notice kd was wearing smaller shoes
pos,Pos,i know it s just one game but giannis looks like he has a faster free throw routine now and has also added some finesse to his basket drives
pos,Pos,one of the low key thing about the bucks is every player other than george hill is either in their prime or yet to enter their prime most of these guys will get better as the season goes on to me that s a huge difference than some of these contenders who are loaded with guys in their 30 s edit lopez isn t really in his prime anymore but he anchors the paint and just does his thing
pos,Pos,great and fun first game i m just super excited for the nba to be back giannis and jordan nwora are the 2 best players in the league
pos,Pos,bucks are deeeep gonna be a fun year
pos,Pos,and this was without bobby donte semi hood and a half of jrue i love this team
pos,Pos,i hope mills finally gets consideration for 6moty now that he has more eyes on him
pos,Pos,what time five you smoking kendrick cause my top five is 1 nwora 2 nwora 3 nwora 4 nwora 5 nwora
pos,Pos,jrue one half into my promising first week of fantasy basketball ever ight imma head out
pos,Pos,allen nwora connaughton all looking good with bobby jrue and donte back we are looking a heavy favourite for a repeat
pos,Pos,swear to god the ball was dunked in butter nobody could hold onto it
pos,Pos,get patty mills some help
neg,Neg,bucks woke up feeling dangerous no bobby and no jrue second half
pos,Pos,imagine if brooklyn had someone like kyrie
pos,Pos,giannis was more efficient than kd from the line what world are we living in
pos,Pos,shout out to thanasis getting some solid minutes in the rotation dude looks much more controlled and comfortable than previous years
pos,Pos,go bet patty for 6moy
pos,Pos,glad to see patty keeping his fiba form he is going to have a monster season with flatearth taking a sabbatical
pos,Neg,calling it now we are going to have mj lebron giannis goat debates in the not too distant future
neg,Neg,fuck did we activate nova giannis
pos,Pos,just a memo to bucks fans winning on your banner presentation ring ceremony night is an incredibly good omen for the season going right hell you even are getting your injuries out of the way early also i was skeptical of putting giannis at number 2 overall amongst active players and moving lebron to number 3 but from what i have seen that is accurate one kd two giannis three lebron the gap between these three is pretty small but giannis deserves to be above lebron this season especially because he s reigning champion and is entering the same type of prime jump kd and lebron had after they won their first championship giannis and the bucks floor for the next 4 5 season is likely the second round and top 4 at the lowest in the east
neg,Neg,bucks missing portis hood done and lost jrue during the second quarter and still control this entire game but the media will probably spend all day talking about how important kyrie would have been in this game
neg,Pos,damn 22 2 bucks on pts off turnovers
pos,Neg,nic claxton was absolutely atrocious the box score won t tell you but the eye test did
pos,Pos,nash took kd and harden out so they could all brainstorm on the bench for longer figuring out who s gonna be the one to blowdart the vaccine into kyrie
pos,Pos,alright r nba time to overreact go
pos,Pos,pat pat
pos,Pos,i know he said he is glad that he doesn t have to be the player he was in houston because he is playing with kd but without kyrie harden might need to play a little more like he did in houston
pos,Pos,no way the bucks win if harden was still alive
pos,Pos,world champion bucks underdogs on ring night 1 5 earlier this week cash that bucks win
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,real talk bkn kd needs to make it work with him and harden
neg,Neg,i was told a healthy kd and harden easily beats a fully healthy bucks team but they cant even keep up with a bucks team without bobby donte and only a half of jrue
pos,Pos,nobody can hate the bucks right now
pos,Pos,copium we dont need kyrie we have kd and harden
neg,Pos,bucks in midseson form
pos,Pos,pain for the nets fans blood for the blood god
pos,Pos,the first place bucks beat the last place nets in a blowout
pos,Neg,hope kyrie gets vaccinated and patty mills gets benched for good
pos,Pos,when you re half assing and over relying on kd from day 1
neg,Pos,cam thomas who played four minutes matched the scoring from the entire nets bench minus patty mills wow
pos,Pos,nets are on pace to lose 82 games this season
pos,Pos,i ll repeat my comments from the game thread giannis had incredible finesse bucks look like they didn t skip a beat coming from the finals
pos,Pos,today was a good day
neg,Neg,first game of season is always a blow out for some reason lol
pos,Pos,bruce brown was an end of bench guy today why our bigs rotation is fucked clax is too raw and aldridge millsap are not good blake still our best big
pos,Pos,patty mills 2021 all star
pos,Pos,pat vs patty
pos,Pos,nwora
neg,Pos,still have the return of bobby to look forward to
pos,Pos,i was legit scared about the nets when they signs mills and i was right too
neg,Pos,patty mills shooting the lights out 7 out of 7 the only positive
pos,Pos,patty mills looks like a steal for the nets now nets were 7 with him on the floor 30 when he was off which was only about 18 minutes
pos,Pos,as a minnesota fan would love another small market team like the bucks win it all again
pos,Pos,someone told me the nets would beat this team if healthy so now where are the goal posts
pos,Pos,kd and harden need to understand they can t sit back and relax their way to a championship just because they brought patty mills in
neg,Pos,as a spurs fan i m just happy to see patty mills doing well
pos,Pos,but if james harden wasn t hurt the nets sweep the bucks
pos,Pos,nets and lakers both losing good vibes to start the season
pos,Neg,more like nots
pos,Pos,revenge game btw hope you are well jrue baby
pos,Pos,this should put the nets on watch if kyrie continues to be a dumbass this bucks team very much can knock them out come playoffs again giannis just putting on a great show tonight
pos,Pos,man i really don t like to pile on players unnecessarily but i m so fucking glad that kelly oubre isn t on this team anymore lmao having everyone on the floor being a willing passer makes such a huge difference
pos,Pos,bjelica looks exactly like david lee out there i kept thinking he d come out of retirement
neg,Neg,welcome to the poole party everyone
neg,Neg,we have a bench im crying
neg,Pos,the lakers and the nets have the 2 worst records in the entire league
pos,Pos,look at poole man so inspirational warriors are gonna have a lot more must see games this year and i m all on board for that definitely way too soon to say whether they re serious title contenders or not but i m hype as fuck
pos,Pos,i thought this was fucking hilarious when it popped up on screen
pos,Pos,nemanja bjelica looks like an athletic jokic out there dude has been liberated by the god of freewheeling offense and he s promulgating the scripture to all of us
pos,Pos,15 11 4 1 on 86 100 100 splits and 20 in 26 minutes off the bench fantastic warriors debut for bjelica
neg,Pos,bjelica is the early leader for best value pickup of the offseason
pos,Pos,i just got out of a thai prison why did the lakers trade for westbrook when they could have gotten bjelica instead
neg,Neg,bjelica gonna be great on the warriors
pos,Pos,andre iguodala is clearly the face of the warriors dynasty they were never successful without him
neg,Pos,we bjelieve
pos,Pos,westbrook just standing on the floor wasting cap space
pos,Pos,warriors got their jokic
pos,Pos,belly with the 20 that s our jokic at home
pos,Pos,golden state 2015 201 9 7 golden state warriors ball movement warriors those extra passes are so beautiful to watch bjelica being able to drive and have quick decisions on passes added a great layer to poole lee bench continuing their chemistry from last season cant wait for the curry dray high pnr plus bjelica edit how about iggy tho dude proved hes still got plenty in the tank while at the heat and probs still gonna have good minutes at 37
pos,Pos,i m not overreacting but bjelica is literally all of the best parts of curry lebron and jokic in one player poole pretty cute too
neg,Pos,they didn t get the w but the lakers have to be somewhat pleased with getting 75 points from their big three right out of the gate
pos,Pos,westbrook is just going to be a repeat of the schroeder issue he kills the spacing because he s not an outside shooting threat and his offense relies on drives into the paint plus he doesn t contribute well without the ball in his hands it s basically the exact opposite of what you want alongside lebron unless you have him running the second unit it just makes no sense
neg,Neg,impressive debut from westbrook
pos,Pos,anti vax andrew diagnoses your team with bad
neg,Pos,like i said in the game thread bjelica always been a fuckin baller but no one noticed bc he was on the kings and no warriors didn t unlock him beli been good
pos,Neg,lakers haven t won opening night since lebron got there and it s just one game they ll be completely fine that said westbrook was horrible and tonight illustrated just about every point that laker doubters have brought up since the new roster came together russ lack of shooting lack of replacement defense for the departed kcp caruso kuzma all on display lbj and ad both having 30 points while no other laker hit double digits encapsulates it perfectly
pos,Pos,the lakers have lost 10 straight games and lebron hasn t won an opening night game with the lakers pain
pos,Pos,warriors offence got me like
neg,Neg,that s russ
pos,Pos,to the person who said if your season depends on jordan poole then i have bad news for you buddy i hope you are witnessing this
pos,Pos,bjelica
pos,Pos,i love nemanja bjelica this team is soooo much better than last year
pos,Neg,just as i predicted curry with a draymond statline of inefficient triple double ad and lebron would put up 70 points on high efficiency jordan poole and russell single game doesn t matter westbrook would still bring the warriors the win
pos,Pos,can you imagine these guys when they get klay fucking thompson back
pos,Pos,this is a very very concerning loss for the lakers if you told me steph would go 5 21 and lebron ad would combine for 67 points i would ve guessed the lakers won by 30
pos,Pos,who did this lmao
pos,Pos,we bjelieve
pos,Pos,bjelica for the most part won this game for the warriors
pos,Pos,anthony davis fell a 146 times to the floor tonight a new nba record what a stud
pos,Pos,the warriors are gonna be a problem steph and dray weren t even good and they still won pretty easily not trippin bout the lakers cause bron and ad looked like bron and ad but man russ looks like a bad fit
pos,Pos,ad and lebron played great we shut down steph curry and we still lose wtf
pos,Neg,me mom can we have nikola jokic mom we have nikola jokic at home at home nemanja bjelica
neg,Pos,some hot takeaways from this game jordan poole is the greatest jordan even better than jordan nwora is curry the second worst player only above westbrick is nemanja bjelica a secret twin of nikola jokic will lakers make the play ins who will face warriors in the finals bucks or nets
pos,Pos,i for one pained by the westbrook experience
pos,Pos,reposting this from the game thread russ is going to feast on bottom feeders all year to give laker bros hope and then drop these type of performances in the playoffs play in it s written in the fuckin stars he was absolutley clueless in crunch time he would hand it off for the lebron iso and then clog the paint like what surround lebron with shooters its so fucking simple lmao
pos,Pos,i didn t know who bjelica was before this but i think he s my new religion
neg,Pos,the real star of the show is bjelica
pos,Pos,man i missed shaq chuck and ernie
pos,Pos,random thoughts this game could be summed as lebron and ad vs the warriors this warriors teams reminds me of the 2014 15 squad game was super intense did not feel like a regular season game at all ass tier execution by both teams so many stupid mistakes godawful turnovers and some bafflingly bad decisions by players who quite frankly should know better butterfingers butterfingers everywhere both teams bricked a lot of wide open shots but it seemed to happen more to the warriors than the lakers at least from eyeballing it its going to be really interesting with the new rules to see what the refs allow don t allow on defense seemed like the players weren t really sure either and it led to a decent amount of confusion going off that im getting really tired of teams crashing shooters landing space and refs not calling shit its a cheap cowardly play and i thought the nba got rid of that bruce bowen shit but it seems to be making a resurgence move the fucking courtside seats back like 6 fucking feet there s no reason in this day and age to have players crashing into fans its a needless risk to player health warriors gutted this game out really impressive gutsy win for them especially considering how well bron and ad played lakers bron and ad put forth a herculean effort this game legit hard carried the rest of the lakers wb looked fucking putrid awful shooting and awful shot selection clogged the paint didnt space the court bad to s bad defense didn t create good looks for others just downright awful in pretty much every regard i expect wb will get better as the season goes on but its gonna rough sailing till then melo and dj all look cooked rn if melo and dj see significant minutes this year its gonna be uh rough for the lakers when they re in rondo and dwight were both meh solid uninteresting contributors didn t do anything really noteworthy good or bad baze was a surprising positive no obvious boneheaded plays good shot selection good d big question if he can maintain this level of composure though monk was basically a non factor outside of one made 3 kinda surprised how many minutes he played tbh left zero imprint on the game kinda surprised they didn t go to ab earlier i get he hasn t gone through practice walkthroughs but he s a pro whose played with bron ad before dude should have gotten more minutes lakers offense is painfully bad it basically devolved into pnr with ad or swing the ball around until ad bron wb or melo iso which is concerning going forward defense didn t look much better and has taken a step back compared to last year got cut to ribbons multiple times too many negative defenders on the court lakers d also seems to struggle against stretch bigs and they currently don t seem to have an answer for them i look forward to seeing how they adjust lakers without bron or ad on the court are fucking bad rn like there bench is gonna hemorrhage leads should get better once wb gets his rhythm but until then its gonna be rough once the lakers get healthier ad really needs to slide the 5 playing him along side dj dwight is just not gonna work longterm and their spacing is just garbage with two bigs on the court lakers left too many points at the line free throw drills for everyone tomorrow warriors steph had an ugly ugly game the lakers played him very physical on the perimeter and were hard trapping him constantly basically playoff d in game 1 credit to them will be interesting to see how if the warriors can adjust in future games he also created tons of open looks for his teammates insert gravity memes here jp is a fucking enigma dude looked downright awful in the 1st half almost unplayable somehow regrouped and had a solid 2nd half good showing of his mental fortitude dude definitely has that nba wiggle too him d is a work in progress has too many mental lapses also i swear the harder the shot the higher percentage he shoots especially near the rim wiggins played not good imo seemed to struggle on offense since his role is less clearly defined now had some bad forced takes ugly to s defense was alright though draymond was dray good d solid passing screens like his aggressiveness attacking the rim lots of competitive yelling looney looked his usual self seems to be moving better and his passing visions off traps cuts was much better than last year belli looked to fit in seamlessly and played really well one of the few players making constant good decisions and the lakers seemed to have no answer for him also impressed with his handle iguodala seems to have found the fucking fountain of youth seriously did not expect him to play this well especially considering how meh he looked in miami damion lee played shockingly well his slashing finishing seems to have improved significantly compared to previous years kinda surprised opj didn t get more run he looked good in limited minutes moody impressed me really good decision making for a rookie has a knack for finding the ball made good passes played good enough d this team is small and will struggle against bigger teams only real hope in that regard is wiseman coming back and being a neutral contributor warriors bench is gonna be good this year they don t have the top end talent of serious contenders but there isn t a ton of drop off between guys 4 10 on the bench bbiq and passing has improved exponentially compared to last years teams what a fucking palette cleanser last years warriors team would have rolled over and died in the 2nd quarter and been down 15 20 at the half they played like ass but found ways to scratch and claw back into the game impressive considering how off steph shot the ball
pos,Pos,westbrook was baaad new team new system yeah but vogel really needs to help brodie find his role in this team definitely not playing with rondo and handing off to lebron
neg,Pos,awesome way to start the season for the lads having iguodala back absolutely rules poole looked nice and steph with an off night shooting settled for a triple double instead bench looked very solid i would love for damion to further establish himself for bjelica to make a difference both of those things happened tonight so fair to say i m pretty stoked plus dray is looking slim league is fucked he might mess around and score 8 a game again loved seeing all the movement on offense guys making the extra pass they out rebounded the lakers too which i wasn t expecting going in gg lakers no one on our roster atm is a great answer to ad doubt that ll change much as an aside i physically can not wait to see klay play again when he suits up and hits a catch shoot 3 after all this time it ll be a moment to behold
pos,Pos,the steph poole klay dray bjelica minutes later this season are going to be so goddamn sexy
pos,Pos,westbrook just standing around helping the other team win always looking angry and aggressive but actually just a nice guy
neg,Neg,is it time to be concerned about steph curry s legacy
pos,Pos,imagine telling lakers fans that they d lose due to a passing clinic from nemanja and a shooting clinic from poole while curry has a poor game for his standards along with ad and bron dropping 30 each
neg,Pos,nemanja bjelica navigated the intermediate range perfectly tonight made the right decision every time boris diaw esque
neg,Pos,don t worry guys it s just preseason oh wait
pos,Pos,the warriors really got kirkland jokic on a minimum contract smh
pos,Pos,so heard a commentor mention this when steph curry slipped he mentioned about a drink spilt over by the people not wearing masks so then i wondered what is the staples center protocol for wearing masks well everyone is required to wear masks and they require a vaccine card or proof of non illness 3 days or fewer to the event now i am not a conspiracy guy i am fully vaccinated and plan to get the booster prior to my trip out of the country however seeing all those celebrities masked less when the requirements said you need to wear a mask and all the peons in the back had masks really bothered me why can these front row celebrities be there and not worry about wearing a mask when the website clearly states the mask is required it makes them look like entitled children and why is it not being enforced again i am on the vaccine side politically but it just really jarred by that they weren t wearing masks when the staples center claims masked are a requirement
pos,Pos,wow what an uncharacteristic incredibly inefficient game for westbrook
pos,Pos,ok can we now talk about how lebron scored 34 on mostly jumpers
neg,Neg,man the warriors looked like they deserved to be blown out in the first half that closing first half lineup from the lakers was a disaster their lack of defense kept the warriors in it really excited for bjelica on the warriors he s going to fit in great next to steph
pos,Pos,i don t want it to be true but i could see this disastrous westbrook trade a mile away and then calling it a big three makes lebron and ad look worse because they definitely aren t a big three lebron and ad with 30 each westbrook with 23 id trade westbrook for caruso
pos,Pos,curry 5 21 with no klay and the warriors beat the lakers easily they re straight dogshit
neg,Neg,excited to see klay and wiseman back with this squad
pos,Pos,russ should just announce he s anti vax and save himself the embarrassment of having to look this bad
pos,Pos,i knew there was a reason i was excited when westbrook was traded to la
pos,Pos,lebron james and anthony davis were the only lakers to show up westbrook and the roleplayers were invisible out there
pos,Pos,just the first game but watching bjelica it goes to show that the system fit and teammates fit is so important for players especially role players nba players are all good to make it to that level but just being in a different situation makes him look like a different level player man his skill set fits the warriors offense perfectly
pos,Pos,if the lakers continue at this rate we might have world peace by mid season
pos,Pos,running around doing nothing he tricked y all
pos,Pos,not the larriors
neg,Neg,damn the warriors are so fucking fun to watch when they pass like that
pos,Pos,losing to golden state at home when curry goes 5 21 is not a good sign for the lakers
neg,Neg,is bjelica a god
pos,Pos,the lakers and nets are the two worst teams in the nba rn
pos,Pos,people will say it s overreaction but this team has no shot of winning anything not with rondo westbrook monk melo and deandre jordan defensively you have no real 2 way players because you lost them all in a trade for a guy who s on a 40 milion dollar contract and can t do anything great job lakers front office hield kcp probably caruso and a pick would ve been so much better what a disaster
pos,Pos,i m so grateful to be able to tell my grandkids that i was able to watch bjelica play
neg,Pos,wiggins shut out lebron as soon as he entered the 4th and hit the dagger gg yall
pos,Pos,all these hofers just to lose to jordan poole
pos,Pos,i can t believe the warriors won a game where steph couldn t hit shots ft shots don t count and lebron and ad played great
pos,Pos,i don t think ad and lebron gonna last till playoff if they have to bust their asses of every night playing 40 mins like this lakers need to find a way to fit westbrook in even bench him and let he playing with opponent s 2nd strings
pos,Pos,lakers are on pace to go 0 82
neg,Pos,i don t want to overreact but i think this might be a better bench unit than our first title run
pos,Pos,klay looked depressed everytime the camera panned to him on the sidelines neither team looked wcf worthy tonight but it s a long season
pos,Pos,i know no one has the guts to say it but as a die hard lakers fan i think i speak for all of us when i say we don t want russell westbrook here he is a liability and is holding this elite team back it would be the best to send him elsewhere in exchange for a few 2nd round picks
pos,Pos,russ stans could compete with simone biles for gold with all the gymnastics they do to convince themselves he s still a net positive he won an mvp 5 years ago but at this stage he doesn t contribute to winning basketball
neg,Neg,that settles the goat debate jordan poole lebron
pos,Pos,lamelo with 31 9 7 on 7 9 from 3 wtf
neg,Pos,lamelo was amazing to lead the comeback and hayward was super big in the fourth quarter nice stuff hornets
pos,Pos,i m already depressed
pos,Pos,miles bridges is zion on weight watchers
neg,Neg,man lamelo is fucking good lol
neg,Neg,too much ref ball at the very end but what a crazy opening game ggs all nearly had a damn heart attack
neg,Neg,the pacers at one point were up fucking 23 points and then went and scored 13 points in the 3rd quarter score 75 by halftime be up 23 points before letting charlotte go on a run to end the half score 13 points in the 3rd lose by 1
pos,Pos,hello fuck anyone that hated on our rookie for being too old
neg,Pos,lamelo ball
pos,Neg,buzz buzz bitches haters would say we lost a game by 68 but all i see is 1 0 baby lol
pos,Pos,let it be known that defense brought us back and won us the game yes we had a great offensive run but that came from defense causing bad shots and turnovers
pos,Pos,lamelo s shotmaking was incredible miles is a god ish smith not being washed yet is unironically huge for this team hornets defense still sucks and imo they got away with a couple things during the comeback but it doesn t matter if the effort is there and it wasn t in the first half it was in the second
pos,Pos,can t wait for lamelo to be on the nba 75 list tomorrow
pos,Neg,nice comeback and resilience but still lots of room for improvements mase is kinda ass lamelo s finishing needs to be better but nice shooting hayward was clutch duarte is fucking filth though depending how long those wings are out i m starting to see underrated roty heading his way
neg,Neg,from down 23 to lamelo getting mvp chants this game had it all
pos,Pos,refs almost fucked this game
pos,Pos,lamelo looks ready to have a big season
pos,Pos,what a game a couple of great performances by the youngsters lamelo and duarte
neg,Pos,a lot of cool storylines on this one including that 24 0 run by the hornets in the third to get back from a total beating and that awesome shootout in the fourth quarter prior to the last minute although duarte s awesome debut might be the best storyline of all what a game
pos,Neg,ball brothers 2 0 on the season neva lost hornets remain league pass team from last year
pos,Pos,lamb shouldn t play another fucking minute
pos,Pos,amazing game don t wanna overreact but i think duarte mj
pos,Neg,one hell of a game charlotte played great
pos,Pos,this game was so fun to watch
pos,Pos,buzzzzzz
pos,Pos,buzzzzzzzzzzz
pos,Pos,warren may still be injured but they re not gonna miss him that much if duarter keeps balling like this
pos,Pos,what a crazy 4th quarter so happy basketball is back i ve missed this
pos,Pos,thank you pj and lamelo too hayward with some big time shots as well
pos,Pos,i want duarte injected into my veins
pos,Pos,never in doubt
pos,Pos,lamelo is special happy for the hornets fans here should be a fun season for you guys
pos,Pos,we have melo ball we may never fail
pos,Neg,hope
neg,Pos,same pacers different year get lamb off the team now worthless roster spot also duarte is going to be amazing
pos,Pos,pain for the pacers fans blood for the blood god
pos,Pos,lamelo balling
neg,Pos,looks like duarte might be a good player hope he can keep this up while our guys are injured
pos,Pos,i remember when people said he would be ass at 3 s cause of preseason lmaooo
pos,Pos,sabonis is really going to make the all star team again isnt he
pos,Pos,buzz buzz
pos,Pos,lamelo
neg,Pos,man what a 2nd half that turnaround in the 3rd quarter happened so fast lmao
neg,Neg,lamelo is so damn good
pos,Pos,are you telling me people overreacted to a preseason game in which half our starters played half the game
neg,Pos,hornets redemption tour starts now had to start with the pacers of course
neg,Pos,really fun game but both foul calls at then end were kind of bullshit
neg,Neg,can sabonis get some help sheeeeesh duarte was the only other person out there worth a damn offensively myles did his usual so he s officially maxed out potential wise and brogdon threw up a bullshit ass 3 from 35 feet out for no reason during a clutch possession don t understand the dude never will he s a 4th 5th option at best imo edit s o to the hornets hayward looks healthy again and lamelo is even more legit than advertised
neg,Neg,lamelo had 31 in his sophomore debut holy shit
pos,Pos,one game in and the pacers are already in midseason form god i hate this team and i ll watch all 82 of their games just like i do every year because i m a fucking dumbass
pos,Neg,so much heart in this hornets team they are going to be so good
pos,Pos,well that was a fun game
neg,Neg,basketball is back
pos,Pos,damn what a game let s goooooo
pos,Neg,pacers basketball is officially back
neg,Pos,how long until duarte asks out
pos,Pos,i have no words mainly cause i have nothing to say
pos,Pos,kelly can t b beat
pos,Pos,give lb a second rookie of the year
pos,Pos,betting against the pacers with a big lead has to be the highest paying bet in all of sports
pos,Neg,why didn t bouknight play
pos,Pos,too much karma for indy after that ticky tack foul was called on bridges to give them the late lead
neg,Neg,lamelo hum diddly deeznutz
neg,Pos,exact same game we would have lost last year
pos,Neg,wtf me and my dad checked out at halftime because this was looking like a blowout and we were both busy how the fuck did the hornets win
pos,Pos,this game took years off my life
pos,Pos,i hope chris duarte wins roty or at least continues a similar level of play
pos,Pos,ah the good ol 3rd quarter meltdown
pos,Pos,wow did the pacers only put two guys on the floor in the third what happened there
pos,Pos,everybody dick riding melo for tying his shoes without tripping and falling over this same full strength hornets team got beat by like 100 in the playoffs by indiana last year charlotte you ain t shit until you win a game in the postseason congrats you won this game on a participation trophy whistle i m not learning nothing from this i did not attend this class
neg,Neg,have fun with oubre he is about braindead as they come
pos,Pos,that old ass rookie had a game how come he didnt go pro sooner
neg,Pos,good to see oubre is still hot garbage
pos,Pos,exactly the same as last year have the lead or keep it really close the entire game then force shots and stagnate the offense for the loss
pos,Pos,our offense is rough but good thing we have an elite defense that can get wins for us
pos,Pos,our defense winning us games just like we all anticipated
pos,Pos,cade can t come soon enough
pos,Neg,caruso is so fucking good
pos,Pos,lavine needs to be talked about as one of the premier scorers in the nba he s always had the elite athleticism and finishing but his composure and outside shooting have taken his game to the next level
pos,Neg,zach lavine is good at putting the ball in the hoop
pos,Pos,zach vs grant just like last season a staunch defensive effort by both teams as was expected
pos,Pos,woooo what a way to start the season
neg,Neg,finally not losing a season opener is a step in the right direction lmao some good some bad but ultimately happy to get the w
pos,Pos,whoever said this team would have no defense is a fucking liar also demar shooting 100 from 3 is hype
neg,Neg,bro if we win friday i m prepared to become unbearable to listen to because lord knows the fucking bears don t give me anything to brag about
pos,Pos,legit not a win without caruso he s a fuckin dawg on the floor
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,first loss to deballzach of the year get ready league
pos,Pos,so is 28 year old preseason superstar javonte green who has never established himself as an nba regular not actually a stud bulls need more from the bench
pos,Neg,zo s defense down the stretch was straight up legendary son locked up grant like nothing
neg,Pos,how did vooch look
pos,Pos,caruso definitely not ready for the mediocre competitive spirit of the central division of the eastern conference we are talking airball jerami grant isos with less than a minute remaining if you don t understand that you don t understand the rust belt local detroit tv feed looking like 1980s pbs production quality announcers looking like a few strangers on ctv at a chucky cheese shit looking like it was shot on cameras made of graham crackers i m talking seasonal depression visible in the fans in the stands
pos,Pos,bringing back the 90 s with this defense and our sg carrying the load offensively
pos,Pos,zach good
neg,Neg,we re back
pos,Pos,defense was great and the o as they gain chemistry and hit more of the open opportunities will improve never a doubt
neg,Pos,bulls vs pistons in a low scoring game are we in the late 80s early 90s
neg,Neg,zach lavine i love you
pos,Pos,why didnt cade play
neg,Pos,had bulls 5 feels bad
pos,Pos,zach for mvp
pos,Pos,despite the win and some nice stat lines the bulls looked bad tonight hopefully derozan and vuc can bounce back next game
pos,Pos,zach despite the checks notes win lavine
pos,Pos,this would have been a great offensive performance in 04
pos,Pos,caruso 6moy season incoming dude absolutely hustles out there
pos,Pos,wow what a way to start a season gg pistons hope cade gets healthy soon
pos,Pos,lavine will win mvp this season
pos,Pos,bald man mip
neg,Pos,how was deebo see he hit a 3
pos,Pos,we definitely need coby white back so we can have a consistent scorer off the bench 10 bench points is abysmal
pos,Pos,missed layups and turnovers
neg,Neg,i m just happy that we won and the fact that zach is finally finally getting the calls the last seasons if you saw us play zach wouldn t get calls for anything and to have him get 11 fta and go 11 for 11 is huge
pos,Pos,zach is gonna be 1st team all nba this year
pos,Pos,this is going to be one long fucking season killian makes me sad
pos,Pos,we got it done wooooooooooo
neg,Neg,the guys have a lot to learn can t wait to see what they look like in 20 30 games the potential is there and the defense is really encouraging being able to scrap their way for some ugly wins on their way to getting their s together could make a huge difference
neg,Neg,this team s gonna be sexy
pos,Neg,caruso and lonzo are going to be a problem on defense for everyone zach played a hell of a defensive game too
neg,Neg,i legit assumed chi was all offense no defense after adding deorzan and vucevic boy was i wrong
pos,Pos,the random 17 from lonzo balls i wish we got him instead of wb same with caruso give him back
pos,Pos,killian hayes over haliburton what a terrible pick
pos,Pos,so much for the off season killian hayes hype
pos,Pos,once they get things figured out this will be a really fun team to watch
pos,Pos,zach lavine is something else man i m officially on his mvp campaign
pos,Pos,lmao they initially counted that 2 at the end fucked the 5 5 spread but lol review cancelled that 2 points
pos,Pos,love it good game
pos,Pos,how was patrick williams today
pos,Pos,bulls off to a good start
pos,Pos,this was a pretty good game with a nice chicago comeback near the end lonzo looked really good
pos,Pos,honestly i was pretty happy with that performance on our end we aren t gonna be good but we kept it close with what should be a solid bulls team in a game where lavine popped off and we don t have cade yet saddiq looked very good he definitely added some elements to his game in the off season
pos,Pos,bulls championship book the hotels now y all
pos,Neg,that 4th quarter lineup is how i think the bulls are going to finish games and it s the perfect package of scoring and defense what i also liked is demar and zach taking turns in the clutch i don t think zach has played with someone who can take the clutch pressure off demar had lowry but it was him all the time in the clutch in toronto and san antonio
pos,Pos,where garzilla
neg,Pos,this seems a little too close especially without cade but first game of the season
pos,Pos,offense was super sloppy in the first half but i am loving watching our new squad still think we re making top 4 in the east
pos,Pos,that s interesting that alize was getting all the backup center minutes is tony bradley hurt or just out of the rotation
neg,Pos,lonzo ballpg 17
pos,Pos,we didn t only beat the pistons but the refs too
neg,Pos,
neg,Pos,dammit damar just shoot some 3s man
neg,Pos,7 seed here we come let s go
neg,Pos,pistons are a mess look at that roster 10th men at best on most teams poor cunningham should demand a trade
pos,Pos,i know so many people changed channel furious when cory joseph hit that buzzer beater 2 because it killed bulls covering they have no idea it got reviewed and taken off
pos,Pos,i was told the bulls offense would be unstoppable but they wouldn t be able to stop anyone
pos,Pos,there is no offgame for defense remember that
pos,Pos,is this heaven
pos,Pos,wait we re good at defense now
pos,Pos,had to clean my glasses thought it chauncey and the 04 pistons for a second
pos,Pos,haven t been paying attention to the pistons why didn t cade play
pos,Neg,is it still too early to call kylian hayes a bust
neg,Neg,i forgot alize got picked up by the bulls glad to see him getting some minutes
neg,Neg,10 points from the bench yikes
pos,Neg,honestly a rough game but a lot of positives i expected a blowout tbh but the pistons played pretty good defense and for some reason no matter the outcome i always want to slap oylynk after seeing him play bunch of illegal screens and pushing caruso
neg,Pos,granted its opening week but hate people that have front rows seats and dont stand in crunch time you payed all that money and youre not going to get into the game
pos,Pos,that was exhausting and i don t root for either team
pos,Pos,i m emotionally spent wow what a game
neg,Neg,fuck ventilators new york needs to put in a massive order of heart monitors if this is any indication of the knicks season lol
pos,Pos,nba is back baby that was fun af
pos,Pos,i m horny for fourny
pos,Pos,the former boston celtics defeat the other former boston celtics to defeat the boston celtics
neg,Pos,evan fournier deserves a google search tonight after his performance
neg,Neg,that mightve been one of the most entertaining games ive ever seen in my life it had absolutely everything
neg,Pos,yo boston rematch best of 7 ecf at sundown be there or be square seriously incredible game i hope to god we get a bos ny series this year both these teams are an absolute blast to watch i m fucking stoked for this season also fournier s lean in in the 1st was legit kind of in the grey area imo but i loved that it was a no call so far league s seemed serious about non basketball plays and i hope it keeps it s been great for the game
pos,Neg,tatum needs to be fined or something for ruining that jaylen brown performance
pos,Pos,knicks fans day 1 of 545 holy shit tho insane game no matter when let alone to start the season
pos,Pos,i didn t hear no bell arms fall off
pos,Pos,i don t understand why every basketball game ever isn t at msg
neg,Neg,undefeated
pos,Pos,is it hyperbole for me to say that was probably one of the 10 best regular season games i ve seen also yerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
pos,Pos,the basketball gods knew they couldn t finally give knicks fans a great team without giving them all fucking heart attacks on the first day this game was absolutely incredible well worth the years of my life taken off from the anxiety
pos,Neg,not ready for a heart attack in game one let s go knicks
neg,Neg,the new york knicks are simply the greatest basketball team in the greater new york area
pos,Pos,introducing the real french prince evan fornicate

neg,Pos,greatest opening game of all time
neg,Neg,game of the season unironically
neg,Pos,first one of the season lemme get a yerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
neg,Neg,that was a huge mistake to not bring in more subs both coaches at least thibs finally brought in rose who closed it out
neg,Pos,imagine recovering from covid and the first day you have out of isolation you play a double ot nba game
neg,Neg,from a neutral perspective it s a damn shame either team had to lose this game the intensity was fantastic and even though both teams were clearly gassed they fought til the final buzzer
pos,Pos,jaylen brown does not deserve to be the loser of this game
pos,Pos,man fournier bailed us out really hard in the final minutes and all of ot x_x bullock we still love you but fournier is officially goated no matter what happens in the future good or bad that shit was fucking awesome
neg,Neg,that game was so fucking insane i feel so sorry for jaylen brown but shoutout to evan fournier for being the first knick to score 30 in their team debut
pos,Neg,knicks on track for 82 0
pos,Pos,i survived knicks vs celtics october 20 2021
pos,Neg,tatum with the mamba roomba mentality dude sucked took too many shots when he s been ice cold smh
pos,Neg,epic game
neg,Pos,fournier strategically blowing the defense on the last possession of regulation so he could stat pad
pos,Pos,achieved my dream of moving to nyc two weeks and this was my first time ever watching a game at the garden what a game and what an atmosphere
pos,Pos,not often you get the game of the year on opening night
neg,Pos,absolutely incredible game the east is gonna be wild this year the fight for 3 6 for the heat celtics hawks bulls sixers and knicks is going to be wild two of these teams are gonna fall outside the top six
neg,Pos,what a fucking opener from having an almost unloseable lead from the knicks to somehow getting into ot then 8 3s in a row into no one being able to score at all this is going to be a fucking amazing season love these knicks and so excited to cheer for this group that s again being underrated coming into a season after showing how good they were last season
pos,Pos,last celtics possession a nightmare for the don t need a three here guys
neg,Pos,lost by 4 and missed two easy layups
pos,Pos,kemba walker almost got his ass stomped by some timbs
pos,Pos,people will try to clown tatum but thibs made sure to probably focus their defense on him and let everyone else beat them
pos,Pos,as a neutral that shit was incredible
pos,Pos,welcome to the dennis schroder experience celtics fans
neg,Pos,don t want to overreact but the best game of the season has been played
neg,Pos,nba is back baby

pos,Pos,jaylen brown is a good basketball player

pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,can anyone recommend a good cardiologist
neg,Pos,game is so much better without all the flopping for calls
pos,Neg,need a fucking cigarate lmao
pos,Pos,this is most certainly not good for my heart
pos,Neg,the amount of times i thought we had it won to thinking it was over and back and forth again i m emotionally destroyed
pos,Pos,knicks fans please explain this yerrr thing plz
pos,Pos,this game is up there with the easter 2012 knicks bulls games as one of my favorites all time what an amazing opener
pos,Neg,that was stress
pos,Pos,i can t wait of the mfing sidetalk nyc that comes from this game yeeeeeeeeeeer d
pos,Pos,jaylen brown is gonna be a perennial all star i just know it
pos,Pos,this was a stressful ass game and i didn t even care who won
pos,Neg,yerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
pos,Pos,what a way to start a season gotta love the knicks
neg,Pos,what a game
neg,Neg,yeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
pos,Neg,i mean it was a bunch of missed shots missed dunks slipping on wet spots and slow moving players but damn what an amazing finish great job by announcing crew of reminding you just how tired they were to start ot and keeping that out front then that crowd
pos,Pos,what a banger
neg,Neg,hey i m reading the box score who was on tatum on the outside barrett for a double ot game that s a smothering line wow
pos,Pos,i need a cigarette after that one
pos,Pos,to start fuck the celtics have a nice day
pos,Neg,i was shitting and pissing the last hour of this game
neg,Neg,i cannot stress this enough what a fucking game
pos,Neg,welcome back nba oh how i missed you
pos,Pos,i think mike breen is now ok that he missed the wizards preseason game for this bad boy tonight
pos,Neg,randle and fournier were obviously great but rj and obi showed up as well which was nice respect to brown for a great game from him as well
pos,Pos,a shame that people will forget jaylen s phenomenal performance because they lost and he had that missed dunk at the end really great game though and kudos to both teams
pos,Pos,of course the one game i decide to skip ends up being a fucking thrill ride
pos,Pos,i passed out thinking the knicks won 108 100 i m an idiot for missing the end of this game watched the highlights on the nba yt channel is there any way to watch a replay
pos,Pos,banton s nba debut was a thing of beauty can t say that about most of the rest of the game unfortunately
pos,Pos,i m not trying to overreact but the wiz are going 82 0
pos,Pos,dalano banton really gave me false hopes and promises for a solid 5 minutes
neg,Neg,what emotion do i feel right now it is foreign to me
pos,Pos,5 blocks for gafford he s worth it
pos,Pos,kyle kuzma effect
neg,Pos,i m not one to overreact but dalano banton is the greatest basketball player to ever live
pos,Pos,actually had fun watching the wizards play for the first time in a while
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,our rookies were by far the best players on the team tonight
pos,Neg,all things considered that wasn t a bad debut from scottie 12 9 1 1 and he had a couple potential assists that should ve been easy baskets for birch gtj but can t complain about this on to the next one
pos,Pos,guys it s okay we re still tied with brooklyn in the standings
pos,Pos,banton had a nice game at least barnes was good in some spots but 6 turnovers is rough 5 fouls isn t great either those are both the sorts of things that experience might help og and fred both struggled and we re not going to win games without those guys performing well on offense on the one hand i think we re better than this one game made us look on the other hand that s not saying much cause we looked terrible
pos,Pos,let s overreact wizards to the 4th seed
pos,Pos,we are never going to lose
pos,Pos,kuz was 20
neg,Pos,82 wins baby
pos,Neg,nurse better put banton in before the second half next game he jumpstarted a stone cold offense and played pretty smart on the other end this whole game made me miss siakam the whole offense started boiling down to attacking the rim and it was ugly i kept looking at it and thinking about how if it was siakam he would ve made it work at least a lot better than it was
pos,Neg,wuj brooks lets go wizards
pos,Pos,i feel like the wizards are gonna be significantly better this year
pos,Pos,what is this feeling i have is it optimism is it the feeling of having a competent head coach what the fuck
neg,Pos,lakers fleeced
pos,Pos,the wuj coty campaign begins now
pos,Pos,meh cant win them all
pos,Neg,remember that game vs houston a few yrs back early in the szn and the game finished like 160 159 the wiz only allowed 83 pts today in today s nba this is a promising first sign for wuj other than the team acting dumb in the 4th to have toronto cut it to like 10 and not knowing how to handle a full court press this was a phenomenal debut
pos,Neg,we played like shit got some momentum late in the game but couldn t carry through it is what it is onto the next one
neg,Pos,narrative time
pos,Pos,gg wizard bros you guys looked scary out there unseld seems like a huge improvement over brooks you love to see it from the canadian boy branton i m very happy from what i saw from barnes in his debut he s gonna be alright we really need to work on our shooting though it was lowkey kind of embarrassing pointing at you freddie and og bright side was that our defense wasn t too bad
pos,Pos,west unseld jr coty just in tonight alone
pos,Pos,our team is fucking deep
pos,Pos,if tonight was anything to go by our rebuild is gonna take a little bit longer than one would hope came into this game expecting our offence to be really bad but those first 3 quarters were something else we ll have to see how our shooting fares over the next few games because if tonight wasn t an anomaly and we re consistently shooting 20 from 3 we may not even crack 20 wins wizards look much better this year it ll be interesting to see where they end up in the standings gg s all
pos,Pos,next game is against celtics we re already 0 2 rookies showed promise tho
pos,Neg,og at 21 and fred at 22 two established guys legitimately preventing the game from even being competitive
pos,Pos,drake the type of fella to watch his team lose their season opener by 15
neg,Neg,siakam plz
neg,Neg,someone please come take bertans from us
pos,Pos,banton roy
neg,Neg,at least our young guys looked good that s what matters this season
neg,Neg,flynn dnp
pos,Pos,that was an ugly game but i can already tell i am gonna have fun watching scottie and banton develop this year banton in particular was a nice surprise spark plug tonight
neg,Neg,both good and bad thing when your rookies looked like the vets out there
pos,Pos,well i hope the raptors score more than 83 points next game nice spark from delano and scottie in the 4th quarter but man that was some of the worst offense i ve seen an from a raptors team in a long time og and freddie were awful tonight hope this was just a off night for them and they bounce back
pos,Pos,that was historically bad thankfully the shooting is an outlier and og won t be shooting that badly again anytime soon fred is another story he killed the offense everytime he was on the floor reason the offense was sparked after dalano came in is cause the ball moved more than once a possession before somebody would take the shot
pos,Pos,fvv pnr creates no advantage _
pos,Pos,ugh can t blame baynes this time but seriously that was a horrendous shooting night and it will take some time to get everyone on board nurse s system going to be a rough start but hopefully they can get it together after a few games
pos,Pos,i d be shocked if we aren t a bottom five offensive team this season lmfao
neg,Neg,love to see it defense was played for the first time in like 5 years lol we also might be the deepest team in the league we go 9 10 deep and beal doesn t have to drop 30 points a game for us to stay competitive i love russ but going from one a player to a bunch of b c guys is significantly better for us going foward
pos,Neg,that was ugly boi
pos,Pos,rookies looked pretty good not going to draw any concrete conclusions when og and fred shoot 8 37 and 3 18 from 3
neg,Pos,2 teams below 3digits what is this
neg,Neg,the toronto raptors have been eliminated from playoff contention
pos,Neg,banton and barnes can t even shoot and they re already top 5 players on the raptors lol
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,that was just straight up embarassing and we have to play actual good teams now kill me
pos,Pos,the raptors are just a straight up bad team crazy how quickly that all ended
pos,Pos,raptor fan told me during preseason that og was a guaranteed 22 a game scorer with all his new moves
pos,Pos,yo raptors give us dragic
neg,Neg,oh wow who would have thought having fvv as your first option on offence would totally suck
pos,Pos,i love it to hell with the raptors and their arrogant ass fan base
neg,Pos,wiz won but have some serious work to do even getting the ball past half court was a struggle the team lacks shot creation
pos,Neg,can we have dragic now
pos,Pos,raptors gonna be a bottom 3 team this year
neg,Pos,5 20 and 3 17 i can t believe raptors fans deluded themselves into thinking those two dudes were untouchable pieces for simmons lmao
neg,Pos,kuzma almost gave that game back to us lmao what a dumpster fire of a player
pos,Pos,brick city for some of these teams tonight huh
pos,Pos,tough to watch can t blame tampa for this one
neg,Neg,precious thinks he s all that a handful of missed slams and his rotations on defense are meh
neg,Pos,my god og looks completely lost out there on offense
pos,Pos,in what world does kuzma shoot nine 3s am i tripping or have we just gotten used to role players just shooting the shit out of the 3 ball nine fucking 3s we re they leaving him open or something
pos,Pos,the moment banton hit that buzzerbeater i fucking got stoked for his debut what an amazing debut wizards offense was kinda wonky got practice them shots specially beal since he needs to take the most important fucking shot
pos,Pos,bradley beal has 4 steals i am glad that he is trying to improce his defensive game
pos,Pos,rough first game for the raptors they need some post defense ain t no way we should be letting montrezl harrell drop 22 on us that easily
neg,Pos,fred was a yikes hopefully he figures it out soon
pos,Pos,don t care the boys are back in town
pos,Pos,after only the first game i have noticed that there is really no one that teams will have to double team regularly once kawhi left teams would play us man to man and with no need to double it became much harder for our players to get open looks we are also are in need of a true center we got bullied in the paint and we didn t play a team with a dominant big davis giannis we do have a very young team and there is going to be some growing pains just my thoughts but it is only the first game
pos,Pos,aaron holiday is ass
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,unpopular opinion raptors would be better off without vanvleet and siakam ball movement is just better when they re off
pos,Pos,og is untradeable
pos,Pos,raptors tank off to a solid start should be proud
pos,Pos,i seriously don t know if the raptors are going to win 10 games this year
pos,Pos,is davis bertans the biggest edit collapse ever
pos,Pos,evan mobley is going to be so good in this league what a player
neg,Pos,really fun game takeaways cavs mobley is a fucking beast first nba game and dropping 17 9 6 on efficient shooting and with insane defense jarrett allen is a force in the paint and with mobley feeding him looks and clogging up the paint with him it looks like we have the frontcourt of our future cedi osman giveth and cedi osman taketh darius garland looks legit but he still needs to work on his vision and aggressiveness we re suffering from a massive hole at wing which makes it impossible for us to run a decent rotation we re either throwing out 3 6 footers or 3 7 footers there s no in between lol grizzlies ja morant desmond bane looked incredible today melton was on fire but not too surprised given the state of our perimeter d did i mention ja morant glad to see ziaire get out there and make an impact immediately jjj had a rough game offensively especially inside but made a huge impact on d dude is so good all around fun game
pos,Pos,i love ja also jarret allen is crazy good
pos,Pos,evan mobley looked like a beast so i m perfectly fine with tonight 17 points 9 rebounds 6 assists a block and a steal on 7 13 shooting and is shooting 3s exactly what we wanted to see out of him
neg,Neg,the ja bane melton brooks jjj small ball line up will be so much fun this year especially if ja can improve marginally on defense
pos,Pos,i don t think we re going to win many games this year but wow mobley sexland and ja are going to be fun to watch they ll keep things interesting love having rubio around watching cedi and lauri play defense made my eyes bleed ja morant is not a friend of the cleveland basketball cavaliers what did we ever do to you huh exist i can guarantee we hate our own existence more than you do
pos,Pos,ja morant is insanely good
pos,Pos,this was a well fought game difference was we were able to close it at the end gg wp
pos,Pos,missable takeaway from this game bane looks incredible his game has significantly evolved from last season and he was good then
pos,Pos,20 10 21 takeaways mem season opener allen was awesome on both ends mobley is already amazing defensively switching everything and good at the rim too morant is filthy and nobody could stop him great game from cedi rubio is essential for our team him and garland set up like all of our guys garland shot bad first half but had 3 big threes in the 4th both teams had pretty good ball movement not many isos cavs switched a lot idk if jb was trying to experiment but there were only like 70 different lineups in the first half garland sexton okoro hardly played so it seems they re pencilling in okoro rubio as the 6th 7th men and having cedi markkanen share sf minutes desmond bane is legit jjj was yeeting that shit like there was no tomorrow but they all somehow went in markkanen is legitimately ass on the boards really fun game overall cavs stayed with memphis most of the game except for a stretch in the 2nd where garland missed like 3 shots in the 3rd where cedi turned the ball over twice and at the end i can prolly count on my hand the number of times cavs scored 120 last season go cavs
neg,Pos,kyle anderson with a signature statline of 10 7 4 with 2 steals and 0 turnovers perennial 8th man of the year
pos,Pos,ja morant is life
pos,Pos,ja ain t messing around this year and he got some bs superstar calls watch out
pos,Pos,we look promising need to fix our defense but otherwise that wasn t half bad and ja is that guy no doubt about it
pos,Pos,mobley a stud
pos,Pos,ziaire was a 13 even though he only hit one shot kids making an impact already and i love it
pos,Pos,what a time to be alive
pos,Pos,cavs mobley is a beast have fun this season
pos,Pos,its just 1 game but desmond bane is winning mip lock it in
pos,Pos,bane got some attitude now and that s a problem
pos,Pos,ja is going to be an all star this season elite regardless of whether or not he fits the mold of what this website is looking for in a superstar
pos,Pos,this game opener was different on so many levels i enjoyed the energy coming from this game hats off to the grizzlies for giving the fans a great experience in the arena and out in the concourse i love the new wynnbet sports bar that place is a destination
neg,Neg,once again we are better than you think we are
pos,Pos,most fun team in the league and it s not even close
pos,Pos,mobley really is a unicorn wow also i love ricky rubio
pos,Neg,second quarter was the difference cavs gave memphis a run for their money otherwise
pos,Pos,cavs played three 7 footers and got outrebounded by the grizzlies
pos,Pos,feels like nobody in this thread is mentioning allen s monster game glad to see him doing well
pos,Pos,mobley s statline looks good did his play reflect it how would cavs fans rate his regular season debut
neg,Pos,this is the first time i really believe people saying they love having rubio around
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,mobley looked so much better than advertised thought he was supposed to be raw and take years but he was great on both sides rubio fun to watch sexton looked to pass more garland s 3 giveth and taketh away okoro played good d and allen is a monster imo the l was more from a few bad stretches of play that we fell behind and had to catch up from than it was ja taking over at the end
pos,Pos,evan mobley shooting a sustainable 50 from beyond the arc league fucked
pos,Pos,cavs fans what s the point of the lauri signing i still don t understand it
pos,Pos,i love our potential but our defense is a train wreck what a game from allen mobley is legit gonna be a fun season cavs basketball is back baby
pos,Neg,cavs sold it down the stretch
pos,Pos,cavs are gonna be my 2nd favorite team to watch this year
pos,Pos,how was mobley outside of stats i didn t get to watch the game but the stats show a real promise excited for that kid
pos,Pos,what happened to kevin love
pos,Pos,i thought ja got fired what s he still doing here
neg,Pos,i like mobley also jjj still has no discipline on the defensive end and keeps tripping and losing control on the offensive end
pos,Pos,props to cleveland for coming in and playing damn hard mobley is a stud gonna do great things cavs just wouldn t freaking go away until ja decided play time was over fun game to attend
pos,Pos,great to see jjj back good on d scored some good blocks just couldn t be as impactful on offense ja morant fucking rules desmond bane is improving which is expected from those that watched him last season mobley allen is a great pairing for both offense and defense but holy shit markannen should not be starting
neg,Neg,our frontcourt looked great dg needs to be more aggressive but has pretty great vision collin needs to play better he s not going to be getting a ton of iso plays like he s used to so he needs to ask k love how he can fit in lol ja bane and melton did a good job carrying the load for the grizz ja might end up getting mip if he plays like this every game
pos,Pos,memphis needs to be able to put a good squad around ja man don t waste his talents
pos,Pos,as a wolves fan this is weird to say but i m not really sure how that could have gone better
pos,Pos,reposting earlier comment game wasn t as close as the score indicates for the timberwolves ant with a consistent 3pt shot is fucking nasty and entertaining to watch he s having so much fun out there and is smiling after every basket towns and russell have looked great too mcdaniels and okogie looked like real threats on defense very impressed for the rockets kpj and augustin are so careless with the ball it almost seems like kpj can t dribble in traffic and is incapable of making a basic pass very disappointed with his play kj needs to see some more playing time jg s playmaking looked good but his shot is very iffy another concern i noticed is that his drives and layup attempts are very telegraphed and thus easy to block he also needs to put on some mass the silver lining for the rockets was sengun he played very well and made very few mistakes he is so intelligent on offense and has suprised me on defense he needs starter minutes garuba looked very good on defense moves his feet surprisingly quickly our garbage time squad was entertaining as hell is this how wolves fans felt tonight for the entirety of the game stephen silas needs to run some actual plays instead of smiling stupidly on the sideline
neg,Neg,do we prefer playing against the nets or bucks in the finals
pos,Pos,the rockets need my 2k player we won it all with me it was me austin
neg,Neg,i can t remember the last time i was this excited about the wolves kg days probably we played lock down defense and edwards looked awesome kat dominant as always genuinely feeling like we are going to make the playoffs this year and be a hard out for anyone
neg,Pos,kat and ant will dominate the offensive headlines but mcdaniels and okogie killed it defensively great showing by the wolves
neg,Neg,that is a young rockets team no doubt but wow that defensive intensity was unlike anything i have seen from a wolves team before
pos,Pos,kat dlo and ant are a legit core they re playoff bound trust me guaranteeeeeee
neg,Pos,our defense gonna be dead last in the league
pos,Pos,who needs ben simmons amiright
pos,Pos,ant and kat
neg,Neg,i haven t thought this through all the way but are rockets all hair team i guess cleveland comes close but i don t think they got it like these young guys
pos,Neg,the score does not show how much of a beatdown this actually was wolves 3rd stringers looked horrible in garbage time and let the rockets go on like a 24 5 run
neg,Pos,i put 300 down on the wolves winning more than 34 games im loving it right now
pos,Pos,to whom it may concern fuck you wolves going to the playoffs special shoutouts to mcdaniels and okogie who are literally all defence guys going by that absolute insane hustle and energy on the defence the scoreline really really didnt do it justice
pos,Pos,stop the count
neg,Neg,if you were doing booze shots for each block or steal the pups got tonight you re fucking dead
pos,Pos,kinda surprised ant jr didn t go out for some minutes
pos,Pos,tank commander wall stopping the rockets from their full potential s
pos,Pos,obviously this isn t sustainable but for once i believe the wolves playing some semblance of defense is sustainable and my god i m so happy
pos,Pos,this is now the perfect sample size to say the wolves are winning it all this season
pos,Pos,league fucked
neg,Neg,only three twolves scored double digits oh that s kinda rough no they won by 20
pos,Pos,start şengün you dumb fucks it d make him so happy
pos,Pos,sengum with per 36 stats of 21 and 11 with 3 ast he s gonna be getting 30 minutes by thanksgiving
pos,Pos,minnesota looking really impressive
pos,Pos,i am once again telling r nba to eat my fucking ass we re going 82 0
pos,Pos,yeah ant is an allstar
pos,Pos,kat ant dlo gonna get the headlines but jaden mcdaniels and josh okogie where great on defense rockets might need to go pick up a vet pg they needed someone that could handle the rock and run the offense
pos,Pos,mcdaniels and okogie were so so good on defence
pos,Pos,thruskii
pos,Pos,great to see the minny big 3 showing out excited to watch them this year
pos,Neg,not satisfied with 1 0
pos,Pos,watched this one with my best friend whos a huge wolves fan our thoughts on this game were basically woah antman go nyoom
pos,Neg,me every season if the wolves start out strong it s a good sign but don t drink the kool aid me after we re 1 0
pos,Neg,while the stats won t show it i liked green tonite shots weren t falling but that s ok for right niw
pos,Pos,it wasn t as close as the final score would indicate
pos,Pos,tbh i didn t see every game or result but hasn t sengün been pretty consistent since the summer league start him play him more you got to develop the guy at this point
pos,Pos,are the spooky wolves back on the menu
pos,Pos,a1 is gonna emerge as the superstar
pos,Neg,dare i say this team is spooky
neg,Pos,we spooky again baybeeeee aroooooooo
pos,Pos,i got free tickets to this game behind the wolves bench and it was pretty fun despite attendance definitely livened up as the game went on and the players were ruthless rockets looked completely outmatched was hoping tate and woods could show a bit more but the passes from everyone were sloppy
pos,Pos,kat singlehandedly resurrecting my fantasy hopes
pos,Pos,green needs to put on a lot of weight he can t be almost the same weight as trae young trying to defend 2s and 3s
neg,Pos,the stats won t show it today jalen green is going to be gooooooood dude just creates space effortlessly
neg,Pos,rough game for kpj and green but they ll bounce back they re too talented not to
pos,Pos,funny how people last year was saying that the draft class is not top heavy lool at edwards and lamelo both of them are straight up ballers
pos,Pos,really good start for the wolves hopefully they can keep it up kat was so fucking good rockets need to start alperen dude needs minutes to get used to nba he s more than used to professional basketball it shows in his ability
pos,Neg,my team is tanking where can i preorder timberwolves bandwagon tickets
pos,Pos,green isn t even close to as nba ready as people on here were spouting he looks bad againt real nba talent he needs to eat some cheeseburgers because he s way too skinny to be trying some of these drives once he realizes those same moves he was using don t work against these guys he ll flourish but it might take a minute
pos,Pos,i used to doubt kat i still do but wolves are becoming sp00ky with this core
pos,Neg,w
pos,Neg,pat bev is the best thing to happen to minny in a long time
neg,Pos,is it too early to say spooky
pos,Pos,hell yeah
pos,Pos,31 combined steals blocks just wow
pos,Pos,how did sengun play numbers look fine for a rookie debut maybe 3 tos are a bit too much can t wait to see him get in the rhythm
pos,Neg,the tank is on
pos,Pos,anyone else see some jimmy butler kinda in jalen green
pos,Pos,god bless andre drummond 6 points and 17 rebounds
neg,Neg,guys i just took a dna test and turns out furkan korkmaz is my dad
neg,Neg,yo keep deleting and posting this post game thread i ve got like 10 different things to comment about furkan korkmaz
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,lmao i knew the 76ers will rally behind fuck ben simmons this season
pos,Pos,not to overreact but drummond was fantastic offensively and defensively
pos,Pos,that sixers bench ish unit of maxey korkmaz drummond thybulle and niang is so solid
pos,Pos,furk trying to dunk from seemingly the foul line was easily the highlight of the night
pos,Pos,process me the fuck up thats some good process right th ere right there if i do saү so my self i say so thats what im talking about trust the process me right now chorus process mmmmmꮇм нo0оଠｏooｏoоଠଠooooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ sam hinkie is my daddy
neg,Neg,danny green 0 0 0 0 0 13 121 000 ben simmons 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
neg,Neg,who needs dame when you have steph turkey
pos,Pos,jv 3 19 what was going on
neg,Neg,sg korkmaz sad pg korkmaz mad ez edit give simmons cut to korkmaz
pos,Pos,i could really go for some hulk like human that can score at the rim at will the missing of bunnies was furkan painful
pos,Pos,also fan the pelicans can shoot lol
neg,Neg,furk for 6th man that dude was wild tonight
pos,Pos,pop the kork baby
pos,Pos,ben simmons listening to marvins room right now
neg,Pos,this thread seems a little quiet i can only imagine if the sixers lost lol
pos,Pos,friday is gonna be lit
neg,Neg,korkmaz and maxey were studs tonight if jv doesn t have the worst shooting night of his career it would ve been a closer game i think zion and him will work fine together edit a word
pos,Pos,fuck ben simmons
pos,Neg,since doc insists on running an all bench unit i m glad drummond somehow manages to be less dumb than dwight howard and plays great d he deflected about 4 lobs out of nowhere and furkan remember when that guy requested a trade
pos,Neg,63 comments would be 630 if the sixers lost sorry no ben drama today
pos,Pos,yeah ben isn t the best point guard on this team
pos,Pos,i truly think at some point in his career embiid can win both an mvp and a dpoty i think the dpoty will come towards the end of his career though
pos,Neg,yea keep deleting our threads you wouldn t do this if we lost anyway yikadeeeeeeeeeeee time to destroy the nets friday
pos,Neg,joe was wound a little tight for this opener but he should keep getting minutes the next few games he did draw a nice charge
pos,Pos,maxey over simmons all day
pos,Pos,they had to wheelbarrow zion out of the stadium his weight might be a problem
pos,Pos,3 19 for valanciunas yikes
neg,Pos,wtf was jonas doing
pos,Pos,i don t know where ben simmons is and i don t care chant your hardest kork deniers
pos,Pos,i haven t been following the league for a few years but how did 14 players get minutes for the 76ers today i thought it was 15 to a roster and 12 13 active for any given day
pos,Pos,i m pretty tired of the pels subreddit defending diarrhea david griffin
pos,Neg,yo so this thread didn t age well haha
pos,Pos,3 19 srsly
pos,Pos,i barely watched any of the game was drummonds 17 boards all just him elbowing teammates for defensive ones or was he actually boxing out etc
pos,Pos,how can drummond play less than 20 mins and nab 17 fucking boards this dude is just a ball magnet
neg,Pos,trade simmons for any decent guard so they don t have to start or play a single minute danny green and this team will still be a contender beasley and beverly honestly wouldn t upset me that much at this point
pos,Pos,25 to go baby
neg,Pos,primo szn
pos,Pos,damn almost had em
pos,Pos,5 guards line up incoming from pop
pos,Pos,did bamba play well tonight folks
pos,Pos,this was probably the most fun i ve had watching a spurs game in quite a while win or lose this will be a fun season to watch
pos,Pos,definitely a spurs game if i ever saw one we ve def got a future even if there s no clear superstar yet please don t flip these guys for the young socialite pls ty
pos,Pos,is devin vassell the greatest player of all time
pos,Pos,fade for cade oh wait anything rhyme with chet
pos,Pos,everyone s asking uhh who would watch these two teams pls just give this young spurs squad a chance they have got to be one of the most fun teams to watch fastbreaks 24 7 dunks lobs the speed hops overall athleticism spurs must have figured out perpetual motion because they ran played 100 24 7 it s also fascinatingly beautiful to watch a soon to be retired 72 yr old coach pop do his thing w the younglings and during the time spent together pass on some of that priceless knowledge he possesses oh throw in some of that championship voodoo while you re at it
pos,Pos,i feel bad for suggs lol kid got terrorized by dejounte dwhite and vassell all night long
pos,Pos,just do this 81 more times light work
pos,Pos,damn that is some balanced scoring by the spurs
pos,Pos,primo has a career average of 100 from the field he s never missed a shot his whole career the true goat
neg,Pos,josh primo is all
pos,Pos,81 1 here we come baby magic basketball
neg,Neg,vassell mvp campaign
pos,Pos,this bode well with my 82 0 prediction
pos,Pos,i will miss demar but i d be lying if i said this new style of play isn t way more entertaining also ily keldon
pos,Pos,this was exactly what we ve been wanting for the past couple years with demar rudy and lamarcus it was nothing but iso after iso no effort of defense and they all had the worst body language in the world you can t win with your leaders playing like that the youngins had so much energy and played straight up team basketball and just went out and had fun jalen suggs was thrown into an extremely fast paced first game hope his bad game doesn t get to him too much oh yeah last thing we have the best home atmosphere every year go ahead and me
pos,Pos,that s not a bad statline for bamba
neg,Pos,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray
pos,Pos,vassell has dog in him man
pos,Pos,i dont miss any of our vets from the last 4 years after this game lol
pos,Pos,keldon johnson is the best spurs pf in history
pos,Pos,man what an absolute shit performance this season is going to suck so much
pos,Pos,why didn t thad play
pos,Pos,we need markelle and ji back in the worst way
pos,Pos,this headline is like the most spurs thing
pos,Pos,first game and i already love mcdermott poeltl 8 orb
pos,Pos,missing kelle but hey go spurs go that backcourt looked pretty good tonight
pos,Pos,i love this team
pos,Pos,oh lord it seems you ve lost to the san antonio spurs
neg,Neg,the spurs are returning to their beautiful form
pos,Pos,these young spurs are so fun to watch
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,on pace to go 82 0 we coming for 6
pos,Pos,82 0 starts now
pos,Pos,it s devin vassell s world us mortals are just living in it
pos,Pos,top to bottom the team looked great defense was so so strong devin looks as good as he was in college lonnie was not hesitating even keira looked dominant this is gonna be a fun season
pos,Pos,haven t had a chance to watch it yet but let s go spurs main things that stick out to me are sugg s rough shooting nothing to worry about after one game and the spurs have great defensive guards but i was pretty high on him so i hope he bounces back the spurs bench is off to a good start a part of me was worried about it after patty and gay left but tonight lonnie and devin stepped up hope to see more of that
pos,Pos,25 games til the record also wow what a fucking game from the young bloods dejounte and derrick were awesome vassell was killing it the third quarter was gorgeous all the love in the world to the vets of last season but wow it felt good to see the young guys fully given the green light
pos,Pos,scoring over 120 without a single player having 20 is the most spurs thing
pos,Pos,lonnie with the 26
pos,Pos,they better lower the damn price on that fast break pass 50 for 5 games to see the magic might be too high we gonna get 10 wins
pos,Pos,this game happened but seriously jamal mosley coached one of the worst first games ever none of these rotations made sense but we did have a last minute injury
pos,Pos,we almost had them
pos,Pos,me a jalen suggs truther well
pos,Pos,am i reading this boxscore correctly poeltl had 7 assists
neg,Pos,when does the off season start again
pos,Pos,it ll be the year 2030 and i ll still be looking around wondering if dejounte murray is a star yet
neg,Pos,what a fun way to start the season for us sorry magic fans the energy of our young squad is palpable they get along and feed off each other this really felt like a new team tonight and josh primo s statline is amazing 1 1 100 all time 3pt shooter lol
pos,Pos,haven t seen the spurs run like that since the 90s
neg,Pos,pop always finds a way
pos,Pos,i don t get why we kept thad young if we re not even going to play him
pos,Pos,no one is winning roty
neg,Pos,free my man thad 0 minutes tf
pos,Pos,wow the magic really have nobody on their team
pos,Pos,my heart keeps expecting to see tim manu and tony under the spurs stats
pos,Pos,pop throwing out primo the last 5 minutes to give the chanting fans what they want michelle beadle sean elliot and bill land low key throwing shade at kawhi taking about the ben simmons situation young spurs core was a fun game
pos,Pos,most spurs looking box score i ve seen in a while almost brings a tear to my eye
pos,Pos,bryn took what like 2 shots and then never saw the court again vassell is a better 3point shooter at this point i don t understand why they brought him back i also noticed that keldons points were the quietest shit i ve ever seen i didn t even realize he had 15 till the announcers brought it up i was about to bitch he ain t doing shit
pos,Neg,i love this team
pos,Neg,the magic look so ass
pos,Pos,32 assists as a team not to overreact but this team is better than the beautiful game 2014 squad
neg,Pos,kyrie for murray and dougie mcbuckets who says no
neg,Pos,bamba
pos,Pos,why did we bring bryn back again
pos,Pos,8 offensive board lol
pos,Pos,mo bamba with the 4x4
pos,Pos,the magic just have so many guards good at the exact same things how are they all suppose to excel
pos,Pos,casual 21 rebounds from rudy lol
neg,Pos,nice to see some actual effort on the perimeter defensively noticeably different from last year especially from mitchell
pos,Pos,we only outscored okc by 1 point in the 18 minutes that gobert sat for we won by 21 it s pretty remarkable the level of impact he has on the game
pos,Pos,another casual 50 wins regular season for utah
neg,Neg,as a thunder fan the roby poster in garbage time made watching that game worth it
pos,Neg,rudy probably unironically a top 10 regular season player if they play the lakers and their bad spacing he might be a top 10 playoff player this year too
pos,Pos,the tank wars are going to be strong this season us okc houston toronto
pos,Neg,not the best game the jazz ever played but gobert conley minutes keep it moving as usual
neg,Neg,we really playing the 0 82 to 82 0 challenge are we
pos,Neg,i wish we were better at free throws baze and roby had some nice dunks 0 82 babyyy
neg,Pos,banchero is gonna look so great in this team without a big
pos,Pos,bojan
pos,Pos,derrick favors plays for okc

pos,Pos,while i m so happy coming away with a dub that l2m report gonna be a joy to read
pos,Pos,i dont think i ever remember lilard not making a three in a game much less when taking 9 threes good shit by kings im rooting for them this year
pos,Pos,despite our best efforts we managed to hang on for the win
pos,Pos,davion mitchell already looks like one of the best perimeter defenders in the league
pos,Pos,richaun holmes has more 3 pointers than dame this season go kings
pos,Neg,when will portland get cj some help
pos,Pos,davion neva lost
pos,Pos,with the way the kings spike my blood pressure i might as well do cocaine
pos,Pos,i shat my pants on behalf of kings fans when that dame three went up
pos,Pos,say it with me because we only get to say it for like one week every couple of years undefeated sacramento kings
pos,Pos,holmes at 4 46m has to be top 5 value contracts out there a quick google and paragraph reading will show you it s not 4 56m
neg,Neg,the kings continue to freak the fuck out of their fans in fourth quarters
pos,Pos,davion is sacramentos new god
pos,Pos,davion mitchell s defense is super legit impressive performance
neg,Neg,dame with an off night
neg,Pos,happy with the win but that 4th quarter was peak cardiac kings
neg,Pos,damn just a super uncharacteristic shooting night from dame
pos,Pos,i worked this game and the energy was crazy we lost but at least it was to a likable fan base
neg,Pos,we may never lose again
pos,Neg,harrison solid barnes
pos,Pos,kings should have fouled but wow lillard 0 9
pos,Pos,davion still hasnt lost
pos,Pos,kings fan ez game kings no you get a free heart attack
pos,Pos,the black falcon strikes
pos,Pos,gg blazers we got lucky that dame was off tonight
neg,Pos,smooth 20 from richaun holmes
neg,Pos,i d rather not talk about the end of that game cj was fire from literally everywhere
neg,Neg,we won but what a bullshit refree shitshow this was
pos,Pos,kings are sneaky asf i swear they ve go reserves of untapped potential somewhere
neg,Pos,damn we got so lucky any other night and all those looks dame got are going in but more to the point on track for 82 0 baby
pos,Pos,jesus that was almost a classic kings loss
pos,Pos,1 game down 81 to go the road to 81 1 continues
neg,Neg,kardiac kings are back baby
neg,Neg,almost lost in kangz fashion but barnes kept us alive lmao
pos,Pos,lmao that was such a bullshit avalanche of 3s there we ve got good shooters but that was insane great effort on defense despite giving up 121 lol thank god we won it was a fun game and a good performance davion and some of these guys can play defense man i m excited
pos,Pos,ok ok ok hear me out we end the season now and start playoffs
pos,Pos,i know its only 1 game but whoever drafted haliburton and mitchell is sitting real pretty right now since we know vlade is gone it might be time the kings experience a reputation shift
pos,Neg,refs really tried it didn t they neva lost davion
pos,Pos,portland chose to model their defence after swiss cheese but damn the kings almost choked lol
neg,Pos,barnes is now underpaid after his contract looked bad before
pos,Pos,hoping fox would make the all star team
neg,Neg,pure pain
neg,Neg,daddy barnes
pos,Pos,holmes
neg,Neg,hell of a game from barnes why did luke take so long to sub in holmes for tt
pos,Pos,eat shit refs and nurk
neg,Neg,kangz are back
pos,Pos,dame had an off night
pos,Pos,fox and davion hounded dame all night
pos,Pos,i see the kings are continuing last year s trend of just letting teams back into every game so frustrating as a fan but hey we won davion stays undefeated
pos,Neg,bagley s camp in shambles
pos,Pos,cj has the ability to be a first option stop discrediting him he and dame is not a good fit but that doesn t mean cj isn t lethal in his own ways tonight he showed up once again his versatility in offense
pos,Pos,lol
pos,Pos,that s a bad shot
pos,Pos,worst officiating ive ever seen in my life
pos,Pos,let s go 1 0 every day baby
pos,Pos,dame playing 40 minutes in first game back while everyone else is under 40 and being probably one of the worse players for the blazers tonight should have gone to cj more he was cooking
pos,Pos,kings are good when mb is on the bench story of past few years
pos,Pos,shit i bought tickets for my girls parents but i thought the game was tonight fuck
pos,Pos,did dame have an off night
pos,Pos,dame gone
pos,Neg,woof they certainly don t make it easy on us kings fans
pos,Pos,ah yes everyone get your fake dame trades ready
pos,Pos,barnes is so good now he doesn t have to be worried ab being traded while on the bench
pos,Pos,i smell a mccollum for simmons trade if he keeps balling
neg,Neg,that was the most stressful win i have ever had the pleasure to watch
neg,Neg,we look like literally the same team as last year i have no expectations for this team to do any thing
pos,Pos,time to blow it up portland
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,dame shot for kobe
pos,Pos,portland just blow it up already
pos,Pos,can a kings fan please explain to me how buddy heild isn t starting on the kings
pos,Pos,same old blazers lol
pos,Pos,he gone
pos,Pos,as usual kings blowing 20 point leads practically giving the game away and the blazers still couldn t take it lmfao
neg,Neg,dame in playoff form already
neg,Pos,kings going to be kings lmao
pos,Pos,horrible turnover by haliburton and horrible shot by dame to end it and also luke walton subbing in davion mitchell for haliburton just because he made that mistake if those guys aren t mature about that it could cause a rift especially because they re young guys essentially playing the same position weird win but i guess a win is a win for them
pos,Pos,lame time
pos,Pos,so weird how dame missed that
neg,Pos,blazers please do not trade cj mccollum for ben simmons lol
pos,Pos,dame injured
neg,Neg,sweet
pos,Pos,nuggets series barnes making a comeback
neg,Neg,tristan lol
neg,Neg,looks like one of these teams coulda used a young socialite
pos,Pos,kings undefeated baby
pos,Pos,wonder where sixers fans who don t want to trade for cj are seems pretty good to me
pos,Pos,yeah they blowing this shit up expeditiously
pos,Pos,heart attack blazers basketball is back
pos,Pos,davion mitchell got one bucket in 20 minutes
pos,Pos,buddy heild looks good with 17
neg,Neg,hello darkness my old friend
pos,Pos,i missed watching jokic
pos,Pos,it s 4 1 now nuggets in 9
pos,Neg,how the fuck jokic end the game with 0 ftas
pos,Pos,jokic could have put up bigger numbers if he wanted to i m so happy nuggets basketball is back
pos,Pos,suns with cp and devin going 5 mins without a fg is pretty insane ayton shooting threes tryna get that bag lmao
pos,Pos,jokic was not backing down ayton and using his inside game at all tonight whats up with that
pos,Pos,will barton looked so great that game it s crazy what being healthy does to a player
pos,Pos,nuggets are the real deal when murray comes back
pos,Pos,thank you jokic
neg,Neg,will barton is the homeless man s kobe bryant
neg,Neg,joker was 28 tonight
pos,Pos,man i cannot wait until we get murray back out there
pos,Pos,we could build a new stadium with all the bricks the suns made in the 3rd and 4th q horrible second half
pos,Pos,big honey starting his mvp re election campaign off strong
pos,Pos,ah yes as we all expected will barton and aaron gordon pulling our ass out of the fire in the fourth jokes aside legit great game from our side and we ll hold our munders high tonight
pos,Pos,my biggest concern is that bones didn t play a single second
neg,Pos,5 assists from mpj lets goooo
neg,Neg,it s just an mvp diff
pos,Pos,jokic a monster
pos,Pos,nuggets in 9 baby
pos,Pos,by the best available numbers we have i think this means the nuggets are going undefeated and the suns will be winless
pos,Pos,jokic coming back looking as good as ever
pos,Pos,horrible from booker 3 15 lol
pos,Pos,checking nuggets box scores is going to be something this season with two j green s i m already stressed out
pos,Pos,let s goooooo nuggies
neg,Pos,when was the last time a top 4 seed with a reigning mvp opened the season as a seven point dog we still have jokic
pos,Pos,theres so much toxicity in this thread between nuggs and suns fans even the announcers mentioned some kind of nuggets suns rivalry but i can t wrap my head around it i just can t hate another smallish market western conference team that home grows all their stars and tries to remain competitive can t remember them tanking ever despite not being afforded the advantage of other teams if you asked me the other team in the west who i wanted to make the finals and who i thought had the best chance to do so it would be them
pos,Pos,wow can t believe everyone on the suns just couldn t shoot blow up the roster trade everyone and tank for the number 1 pick
pos,Pos,m
pos,Pos,damn wish we coulda grabbed one from the nugs with murray out cuz they gonna be real scary when he s back lol
pos,Pos,wait didn t jokic say that the nuggets will lose in the next game what a liar
pos,Pos,whew
pos,Pos,this really would have been a fun series with just a healthy thrill mpj and dozier forget murray fuck injuries man mvp hasnt missed a beat and mike has a new bag
pos,Neg,we have guards again i love it
pos,Pos,nuggets are going to be a good defensive team this year gordon is very good dozier is also good and campazzo is the ultimate hustle and make you mad guy he makes a lot of steals and creates a lot of turnovers
pos,Pos,nuggets in 9
pos,Pos,jokic with a cool 28 niiiiiiiice
pos,Pos,nugs in 9
pos,Pos,nothing better than seeing cp3 lose
pos,Pos,when the nuggets get murray back this team is going to be incredible
pos,Pos,healthy barton dozier healthy green will be a big contributor nuggets still a powerhouse even without murray i hope they stay healthy till he returns this team will be unstoppable imo
pos,Pos,i harbor no hate for the suns y all are an awesome team but damn that felt good after the asswhooping y all gave us in the playoffs lol
pos,Pos,classic suns amirite
neg,Pos,oof suns have to play healthy teams again
pos,Pos,we now return to your regularly scheduled programming of the nuggets being better than the suns hope you boys down in phoenix enjoyed that brief intermission because it s over
neg,Neg,gg nuggets bros nice squad y all are looking spooky
pos,Pos,nuggs need a backup center
neg,Pos,love having healthy barton back
neg,Pos,jokic continuing where he left off in the wcsf carrying his team this time he had help
pos,Pos,nuggets where 12 3 i believe with gordon and murray both last season good dreams for later in the season
neg,Neg,need to score more points and give up less points
pos,Pos,nuggets second unit needs to pick it up good comeback in the 2nd half by the nuggets though
pos,Pos,wow great job by jokic last night he deserves a break in the next game he plays
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,gg from my mvp hope suns keep ayton tho he s gonna be top 10 in the league one day
neg,Pos,cp0
pos,Pos,suns fans coping with the loss on twitter by saying suns in 4 is the peak cringe content i was waiting for good game though
pos,Neg,lakers fans were probably praying for the suns to lose
pos,Pos,all good sun brothers just game 1 of the season
pos,Pos,i don t hate cp3 and my team isn t in the west or the pacific division but seeing how much hate he gets after losing is just incredible to me almost as much hate as when lebron loses
neg,Pos,i stopped watching after the first half and the nuggets made a comeback you re welcome nugget fans
neg,Neg,jae crowder can only shoot vs the lakers
neg,Neg,jokic doing mvp kind of things down the stretch 8 straight points to keep denver with a 7 11 point lead to put away any doubt
pos,Neg,that was a dreadful 4th quarter from the suns they couldn t beat the nuggets s bench unit wil barton has gigantic balls he took some overly confident shots lmao
neg,Pos,hospital finals sun s players bitching and moaning all game long
neg,Neg,it looks like god chose the cardinals
pos,Pos,hard to beat a good team 5 times in a row
pos,Pos,nuggets played like garbage and still won easily
pos,Pos,this game would ve been a perfect example for anyone who thought that ayton didn t deserve a max which btw isn t me dude started off super hot and then did nothing of note for three quarters of the game he also got destroyed by jokic on offense and the whole basis of him earning a max contract is that he can make life difficult for bigs of that caliber
pos,Pos,i have a theory that they let jokic get away with so many offensive fouls that they dont call defensive fouls on him to make up for it
neg,Pos,i love the nuggets i didn t want to sweep them it was really mean of us
pos,Pos,half the league was chucking tonight
pos,Pos,we threw up more bricks than brodie did last night
pos,Pos,3 15 yikes
pos,Pos,why dont they ever play bol bol he always seems to show out during preseason games
pos,Pos,so is this going to be another year of talking about how scary bol bol is going to be and not actually playing him
pos,Pos,where did the sun players who couldn t miss a shot in the playoff series last year go it was silly last year how guys were draining shots from all over the court last night they looked human
neg,Pos,i m late but it s hilarious how i see no posts of a devin booker statline when i see a westbrook one after every single game
pos,Pos,since when did so many nuggets fans think it s cool to be complete assholes sheesh just because a few suns fans trolled y all last year doesn t mean acting degenerate is cool
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,the suns are washed unfortunately
pos,Pos,1st game rusty ness but deandre hunter s defense on luka was exceptional
pos,Pos,cam impressed me this game hunter with an amazing defense on luka trae started off slow in the first half but he was good in the second half this hawks team is loaded
pos,Pos,travis schlenk really gave trae a whole military arsenal huh
neg,Neg,biased but gourgi deing looks like a decent pickup
pos,Pos,that s it christmas is cancelled
pos,Pos,i really hope reddish and hunter can stay healthy this season
pos,Pos,mavs 31 field goals hawks 31 assists burn the tapes
neg,Pos,hawks scouting and development has been masterful tbh that fo has to be discussed among the best in the league
pos,Pos,hey guys i just checked and cam reddish is not north of 300 pounds not even close
neg,Neg,rick carlisle rn edit also gg hawks fans this team is deep af and crackin on the mavs shouldn t take anything away from how damn good yall looked for real that was scary good
pos,Pos,imagine being guarded by hunter for 15 mins then hunter goes off so you think you have a break but a fresh cam reddish comes in
pos,Pos,mavs just lost their christmas off
pos,Pos,deandre hunter
neg,Pos,obviously luka was terrible today but if this was any indication of how the offense will look this season it s gonna be brutal from watching literally the most efficient offense of all time to back to back possessions of dorian finney smith postups had more tonight than the entirety of last season btw in a matter of 2 years yeah of course it s not feasible for luka to have a billion usage every game but trying to tone it down with essentially running back the same roster they ve had for the third year in a row that s already shown is incalaple of doing it just is trying to cure the symptom and not the actual disease cuban even fucking said in an interview before the offseason that the main goal was to bring in another ball handler and yet this massive glaring issue was not addressed at all luka and dragic were almost begging to play together in the media but they couldn t even get that done instead they got in two spot up shooters who cannot even do that because their spacing is fucking horrendous now
neg,Pos,where did you go wrong did trae really just score 19 points from free throws
pos,Pos,2015 warriors vibe from this hawks squad ultra deep with lots of shooters
neg,Neg,hawks picking up where they left off last season
neg,Pos,hawks played great it s only the 1st game but jason kidd isn t gonna be a good coach for us and i m dying on that fucking hill
pos,Pos,i ve been saying it for a while but hunter and reddish are going to be an absolutely disgusting wing duo for years
pos,Pos,cam reddish was lit
neg,Neg,our backup center is pretty dieng good
neg,Neg,i don t wanna keep up the hate train on lloyd pierce cause r atlantahawks can do that shit on their own but man cam reddish looks like a completely different dude with him gone lol he might ve got cut by the guangdong tigers preseason roster the way his rookie year looked and now he s been looking solid tonight and in the bucks series small sample size yea but the growth is obvious
pos,Pos,i think the conclusion that should actually be drawn from this game is that the hawks have a disgustingly powerful pair of young wings that managed to keep doncic in check while still providing offense at the position cam is probably going to get moved at some point but as of right now his value seems to be trending in a directly inverse relationship to ben simmons so it might be a stomachable loss if we get a haul back i don t want to lose cam though it s just not feasible to lock literally everyone up but fuck feasability i want to keep cam and de andre dieng trebuchet ing that 3 was one of the highlights of the night for me us having a big man with a shot to back up capela adds even more wrinkles to an already dynamic offense and the bench was lovin it
pos,Pos,it s amazing how one simple coaching change unlocked the hawks potential
pos,Neg,this was just a massive team difference trae and luka both had an awful 1st half and both had good 2nd halfs they evened out but our team is so damn incredibly deep compared to the mavs we still have lou will gallo and oo that are out meanwhile the mavericks made no meaningful changes in the offseason
pos,Pos,i always knew cam reddish had it in him
neg,Pos,trae and cam outscored luka on opening night still riding the high from last years run
pos,Pos,idk why the media ranked dallas so high on the offseason they didn t get anything done that tells you improved team
pos,Pos,no garbage players on that hawks roster
pos,Pos,deandre hunter had luka on tha damn nuremberg trials
pos,Pos,not to be hyperbolic but the 21 22 atlanta hawks are the greatest basketball team of all time
pos,Pos,jason kidd gone by all star break got luka running a church league offense terrible mid range jumpers dfs post ups i don t know what he did but they weren t doing those things before
pos,Pos,you just lost to sharife cooper
pos,Neg,the first of many
neg,Pos,luka 18 trae cam 19 20 39 18 quick maths
pos,Pos,the hawks playoff run wasn t a fluke them not winning the finals was the fluke
pos,Neg,is it just me or did the mavs try really hard not to surround luka with solid shooters and assist options during the pre season are they banking on him being a lifer
pos,Pos,caw caw
pos,Pos,cam reddish for mvp
pos,Pos,hawks have stupid depth they re gonna be so fun to watch develop all season
pos,Pos,imagine getting a pick and trae young
pos,Pos,mvp all nba trae young dpoy deandre hunter mip cam reddish 6moty kvon huerter all star john collins 1st defensive team clint capela no bias
pos,Pos,trae is the best playmaker in the league
pos,Pos,they micced john collins up tonight and he just seems like a great guy tbqh he even complimented cam on the sidelines like he was a decade older than him it was cute
neg,Pos,big statement win hawks are going to go far
pos,Pos,the hawks are freakin deep
pos,Pos,clamp reddish has arrived
pos,Pos,hope cam is out of his head kid has every ability that tatum has he just needs to find the confidence love him and want nothing but the best for him
pos,Pos,yall think trae young makes the all star game
pos,Pos,hawks good mavs bad
pos,Pos,i wouldn t expect the mavs to do anything against the hawks regardless of the coach also jason kidd is garbage this opener didn t change a thing in my eyes
pos,Pos,hawks are a legit dark horse
pos,Pos,trae young makes him teammates better
pos,Pos,is trae young valid
pos,Neg,splash
pos,Pos,man shout out to cam had a great game
pos,Pos,trae young mvp season incoming
neg,Neg,daily reminder that cam was the pick from the luka trade
pos,Pos,unfortunately hawks and braves are incapable on winning on the same day so braves l incoming
pos,Pos,jason kidd will get all guns pointed at him but doncic came into yet another season out of shape and no one wills say it
pos,Pos,we won the trade reddish mvp
pos,Pos,not to overreact but we re going 82 0
pos,Pos,i don t know if i can physically or emotionally endure an entire season of j kidd and kp on the mavs
pos,Pos,hawks won the trade
pos,Pos,nice win to start the season by the hawks and for the mavericks they can work on weaknesses
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,we got the luka stopper
pos,Pos,mavs need to help luka out
neg,Pos,some great team play tonight
neg,Pos,u cheetahsperm18 please make your post game comments again this season when the mavs play their first game of the season on saturday also gg hawks bros they picked up where they left off and are scary good i will enjoy watching them more when they aren t blasting us in the ass
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,random thoughts luka and trae seem to be struggling to adjust to the new rules arent used to so much perimeter contact since guys arent scared of getting called for fouls on flops both need to learn how to play through the contact better atl is stupidly deep deepest team in the east imo even with trae having an off shooting night they re obliterateing the mav capela s really worked himself into a nice player plays within himself doesnt try too do too much does his job well really great find for atl dallas s offense is too luka centric when hes off it just grinds to a fucking halt dallas desperately needs secondary playmakers both to take the pressure off luka being the sole initiator and run the offense when luka sits kp s lateral quickness is just gone dudes a statue out there its one game but im not enthralled with kidd as a coach atm offense and defense just look atrocious and dated
pos,Neg,put the league on notice
pos,Pos,aight i ve seen enough trae luka
pos,Pos,don t know what the mavs are thinking keeping the exact same fucking team the last 3 years they are screwing over luka giving him dwight powell and finney smith wtf is that
neg,Neg,porzingis 28 minutes 11 points 4 13 shooting 23 back like he never left
pos,Pos,the best part for me was jalen getting some minutes abs hitting some 3 s
pos,Pos,reddish
neg,Neg,100 million airball
pos,Neg,the luka vs trae story has another chapter
neg,Neg,lets goo mavs got that work
pos,Pos,that was fun
neg,Pos,consider this a warning r nba
pos,Pos,when tf did the hawks pick up tlc
pos,Pos,the time space continuum has ruptured
pos,Pos,mavs and losing season openers name a more iconic duo
pos,Pos,damn only was able to see the first quarter and a bit of the 2nd how did they end up blowing out the mavs not that i m complaining
neg,Neg,did you think we had forgotten did you think we had forgiven
pos,Pos,young on the pnr is so fluid with this hawks offence they could literally run anything they want
neg,Pos,1 game and people are already overreacting and trash talking the team oh wait it s the internet
neg,Neg,i am so excited about hunter s defense
pos,Pos,fat luka
pos,Pos,porzingis is softer than baby shit
neg,Pos,who won the trade
pos,Pos,mavericks should hire llyod pierce
pos,Pos,mavs really fucked up going hard with trades in lukas first season they could have had multiple 1st rounders and built up slowly like the hawks but went gun ho and traded their whole team now they are stuck in mediocrity with the same starting side for the last 2 3 seasons no picks and no tradeable assets luka is gone soon no doubt
pos,Pos,honestly i love how we have this violently aggressive chip on our shoulder like after everyone said the ecf was a fluke for us we just said nah you ll see and we re about to go on a tear let s fucking go
pos,Pos,so is r nba going to blame every single mavs loss on kidd this year 1 game in but it already looks that way
pos,Pos,can t wait for the start of the mavs season toronto on saturday great city to play the first regular season game in
pos,Pos,hell of a way to start the season
neg,Pos,luka stans will convince you he had a good game with his stats trust me he didn t but neither did anyone else but brunson
neg,Pos,
neg,Neg,well we have the cowboys i guess
pos,Pos,good to see our neighbors to the north lose
neg,Neg,mavs shoulda grabbed grayson allen while they could
pos,Pos,this is gonna be a long awful season
pos,Pos,the mavs need to get mike tobey on a flight asap
neg,Pos,why did luka get carlisle fired
pos,Pos,tingus pingus sucks so much
pos,Pos,trae betta
pos,Pos,lmao hawks won the trade
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,hawks repeatedly attacked luka in the 2nd quarter to tire him out and get the lead surprised teams don t do this more
neg,Neg,i don t care if luka is bigger and plays d i m taking wins all day luka will rot with that extension until he gets on a team that has a good gm i feel like 3 years from now luka s best will be 1st or 2nd round and the hawks will be at their peak
pos,Pos,dal needs 2 more pieces west is too loaded for their top 2 options to be smith and a inconsistent kp
pos,Pos,none of the marque players played well to their greatness it s game one but kp with every game looks more and more like an overhyped player who is just average with great nights sprinkled in the season
pos,Pos,hot take mavs wont make playoffs
pos,Pos,hawks won the traede
pos,Neg,i don t care about luka or trae or whatever one team is deeper and more talented that team routed a less talented team see you next time
neg,Pos,i really think porzingis is a disaster on this team he needs a new environment
neg,Neg,hunter s defense was astonishing on the mavs side bunch of bums attacking holy shit
neg,Neg,don t think the mavs are gonna get away with not getting talent around luka the same way they failed dirk all those years despite him taking paycuts
pos,Neg,bunch a drama queens in this thread
pos,Pos,kp sucks
pos,Pos,lol all the excuses on this thread for luka oh his team sucks now cause he got blown out lol
pos,Pos,trae luka
pos,Pos,kristaps porzingis is the biggest fraud i ve ever been aware of in the nba
pos,Pos,the kennel is open
pos,Pos,tyler herro s ig followers about to skyrocket again
neg,Pos,tyler 6moty campaign commences
neg,Neg,glad to see kyle lowry and the red jersey team win like usual
pos,Pos,jimmy what do you think about the top 75 i am the top 75
pos,Pos,wtf happened in this game
pos,Pos,spo smiling is that legal
pos,Neg,so heat bucks nets
pos,Neg,my man udonis just didnt feel like getting the biggest ovation of the night lmao
pos,Pos,if miami didn t have basketball i don t know what our sports fans would do
pos,Pos,the score properly reflects how close the game was
neg,Pos,why do i feel like every single bucks vs heat in the regular season ends in a blowout no matter who is at each side of the blowout granted the bucks missed 3 starters heat clearly wanted revenge and it showed in the first quarter the difference in the intensity between the two teams was very big
neg,Neg,tyler said fuck 6moty he s going for mvp
pos,Pos,herro said fuck r nba
neg,Pos,not to overreact but we might never lose a game ever again
pos,Pos,as someone who thought the heat were getting very underrated in the preseason projections i feel very vindicated lowry butler and bam is gonna be a heck of a big 3 for miami even if they don t have an mvp caliber player not to mention they have some solid role players and ofc a good coach i had the heat finishing 3rd in the east with 55 wins and i m definitely feeling good about that projection very very early on
pos,Neg,i don t want to overreact after one game but tyler hero might be better than prime michael jordan
neg,Pos,george hill is getting traded he doesn t have nearly enough letters in his name to get some playing time
pos,Pos,tyler herro with the lebron statline lol
pos,Pos,well it s been so long since we got to play basketball after the bubble ended but it s nice we can bounce back from a finals loss and put up a good win in the first game
pos,Pos,bam is the best giannis defender in the league
pos,Pos,beating the nets and losing to the heat one sidedly damn
neg,Neg,if bam is truly taking that next step this heat squad is fucking scary
pos,Pos,rip ud s dad
pos,Pos,bryn forbes was the key all along
pos,Pos,people sleeping on the heat
neg,Pos,i too expected this game to go the way it did
neg,Pos,in my opinion the bucks won this game
pos,Pos,heat look really good credit to them
neg,Pos,almost had em
pos,Pos,everyone should have known it was over when the heat decided they were gonna make trick daddy dollars their intro music
pos,Neg,pj tucker and kyle lowry on the heat damn i missed an active offseason
pos,Pos,well i had fun in the game thread not really watching the game tho lol i don t really want to judge the bucks with what we had but damn the heat look good i could feel the motivation to whoop our ass that first quarter gg heat bros
pos,Neg,the tyler herro haters real quiet tonight dude s the real deal we knew this had a 3 week break for his first offseason and people roasted him cuz he didn t improve from rookie to sophomore season its herro season baby
pos,Pos,heat culture that was an all time ass whooping reminds me when we went up like 59 17 on the rockets two seasons ago good lord
pos,Pos,heat with 3 guys over 20 and herro with the game high 27 bucks highest scorer 15 tucker with the highes with 31
pos,Neg,no puppies in this kennel
pos,Pos,the wisconsin herd did pretty good in my opinion
neg,Pos,here for the culture chatter
pos,Pos,i m sure there is a bryan forbes joke bucks fans can make to ease the pain but in all seriousness i love this rivalry we are developing stuff like this is hard to come by
pos,Pos,game 2 of the season and bucks 3pt shooting is in playoff form already nice
pos,Pos,why my pp hard
neg,Neg,tyler herro really is the x factor for the heat they are as good as he is honestly
pos,Pos,man this was a nail biter so so close
pos,Pos,this game was much more enjoyable after i realized this was the inevitable result 3 minutes into the game started to pour the drinks and check the fantasy football lineups 80 more to go games that is not drinks don t test me tho
pos,Pos,revenge tour begins now boys
pos,Pos,where were you when deer was kill
neg,Pos,congratulations to the heat on winning the 2022 nba championship
pos,Pos,we always get spanked by the heat in miami i never understand it it s been like 3 years in a row now i remember them whooping our ass in the regular season there
pos,Pos,game was over at halftime i m impressed by the heat being able to score this many points period after last year felt like we couldn t score against elementary schoolers lol
pos,Neg,what a fucking way to bounce back from getting swept last season
pos,Pos,500 team after a championship just smh we can count them out already eastern conference you are safe
neg,Pos,i can t believe i fucking said i had the bucks going 14 0 to start the season
neg,Pos,my team lose but my favourite ish player drops 27 i ve won but at what a cost
pos,Pos,turns out the bucks were never any good it was just pj tucker carrying the whole franchise to a championship s
pos,Pos,i ve been a lifelong bucks fan since 1968 and this is the worst game i ve ever seen them play i m going to be a knicks fan where they know how to play real basketball
neg,Neg,tyler herro is going to be an all star this year
pos,Pos,i d replace defeat with murder
pos,Pos,the heat wanted to make some crispy tasty venison burgers tonight mm mm good
neg,Pos,tyler herro mip
pos,Pos,if you can t handle me at my khredit middleton you don t deserve me at my khash middleton
neg,Neg,everybody wanna say sorry for all that tyler herro disrespect over the last few months
neg,Neg,that s my sandwich
pos,Pos,really hope we can keep it consistent but yeah that was so awesome
pos,Pos,herro
pos,Pos,well that was something good thing that didn t happen in milwaukee on ring night
pos,Pos,kyle lowry ain t no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time cries a lot
pos,Pos,the miami heat broke their all time record for most points scored and largest margin of victory on opening night that wasn t a statement to the champs that was a spankin
pos,Pos,what the duck happened
pos,Neg,close game really came down to the wire
neg,Pos,miami sports radio asking how trashed the bucks got last night on south beach like did they waltz into the arena smelling like alcohol were they shutting down prime 112 they did play hungover and flat kinda surprising on game 2 tbh zero fight
neg,Pos,what the hell happened here
pos,Pos,the score doesn t even accurately reflect how much of an ass whooping this was
neg,Neg,i m ready for the takes bois fire away
neg,Pos,we title contenders
pos,Pos,imagine if lebron had a 15 point game in a 40 point loss
pos,Pos,let the over reactions begin
pos,Pos,idgaf about injuries a 42 point win is a 42 point win especially since giannis and middleton were there
pos,Pos,from 2nd quarter bucks only scored 26 each quarter while heat only scored 32 33 1 point difference so it doesn t really matter this is starting to get suspicious
pos,Pos,i m willing to mentally file this under doesn t count due to the buck s roster thinness i hope our next matchup has us both at full force i want to see how we really do then
neg,Pos,bro idk scrap the game tape
neg,Neg,after last year s offense and our performance in general all season this was a nice opener gotta take it one game at a time though our first 20 25 games are going to be rough and it s a marathon not a sprint hopefully this is just the beginning the east is stacked this year and the west is always tough gotta do this shit whenever it s possible
pos,Pos,wait what
pos,Pos,sandro mamukelashvili looks like mose schrute
pos,Pos,miami heat is the real goon squad
neg,Pos,the box score has connaughton as starting center for bucks lmao is this for real
pos,Pos,well then
pos,Pos,be my herrooo tyyllerr
neg,Pos,there was a prop bet that was 6600 that tyler herro would have 20 6 and 6 and he finished with 27 6 and 5 so that s fun too bad the bucks couldn t even be competitive
pos,Pos,only team beating miami is a fully clicking brooklyn
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,well damn
pos,Neg,decided to watch dune tonight instead happy with my decision it seems
pos,Pos,shout out the heat for coming out with so much energy when the crowd was dead af at the start you could tell they were big bad from last season bucks couldn t match it at the start and gave up when the wide open threes didn t drop gg
pos,Pos,tyler herro hates greece
pos,Pos,tyler herro was just as good as trey young
neg,Neg,guys i m so erect right now
pos,Neg,it s 2020 again bois
neg,Pos,enjoy that one heat fans we will meet again
neg,Pos,middleton and giannis combined was outscored by herro lmao
pos,Pos,bucks fans i am sorry we did that to you but i ll be honest if you sons of bitches keep saying you were missing players to injury i m not going to feel bad you know who had a lot of injuries that you didn t seem to notice the heat team you beat last season we still don t have oladipo imagine if we d had him last night lol if you genuinely believe having holiday and 33 year old lopez would have changed a damn thing you re delusional that was one of the most complete and devastating ass kicking i ve ever seen i was wholly convinced
pos,Pos,bucks down three starters and heat in a revenge game not surprised
pos,Pos,is giannis washed
neg,Neg,tyler herro should have been on nba s top 75
pos,Pos,is this your mvp jimmy probably
pos,Neg,reminder that butler and herro were hurt and oladipo was out in the playoffs last year definition of a hospital ring for the bucks after what happened with brooklyn
pos,Neg,bucks ain t goin back to back with this effort
pos,Pos,wow haslem is still on the team googles yep he s 41 i bet he s lowkey responsible for the hard work culture in miami excellent career
neg,Neg,own those frauds
neg,Pos,bodied
pos,Pos,this is what happens when most of the quality players are missing from one team _ ツ _
neg,Neg,is steph curry really a top 75 player if he can t maintain his 1st quarter performance and finish the game with 100 points on 36 36 shooting and 20 20 from 3
pos,Pos,warriors won but that turnovers almost cost them the game gotta minimize that
neg,Neg,this season is going to be so fucking good
pos,Pos,this was my first in person warriors game i picked a good game
pos,Neg,curry is a monster
pos,Pos,i somehow feared reggie jackson the most despite being cold all game
pos,Pos,not even mad we didn t give up warriors are gonna be near the top of the west this year
pos,Neg,that felt like a vintage 14 16 warriors season steph fucks the sky the full draymond experience iguodala making the right plays and turnovers nearly losing us the game only thing that broke it was the third quarter
pos,Pos,all these dudes are so damn good at basketball wtf
pos,Pos,this is gonna be one of the best seasons ever
neg,Pos,what a game watching curry do this is the best thing to watch in the nba
pos,Pos,steph remains a god i am concerned about the chase floor there were a whole lot of slips tonight hopefully they look into it and make any required changed going forwards
pos,Pos,the west should be worried about the clippers and warriors they both have the ability to make it through the west and both are missing their star players pacific division 2nd round is totally possible
pos,Pos,clips still look really solid without kawhi
pos,Pos,felt like a playoff game fuck curry is amazing
neg,Pos,what a game
pos,Pos,clippers look stronger than we thought
pos,Pos,damn the warriors 2 0 after a terrible curry shooting night and 21 turnovers against both la teams they might be back
pos,Pos,the league just didn t feel the same without the warriors playing at this level
pos,Pos,since my last pgt comment was negative i m gonna go in the opposite direction here shout out to ty lue man i guess we can never really know how much coaching goes on in between quarters and at half time but who woulda thought that the young fish faced man with a perpetually confused look on his face that took over for david blatt would end up being such a good coach his teams always seem to defend well and on top of that they never seem to be out of games he s going to have a very long very successful career for however long he wants also lol this was such a steph curry game go absolutely nuclear let his foot off the gas and get a little lackadaisical throw the ball away a bunch of times then close the game down with some timely 3 s and ft s
neg,Pos,we lost but fuck it i m hyped for this team
pos,Neg,disappointed we didn t get ot i could go for 5 more minutes of that playoff intensity in tip off week i love it
pos,Pos,inject this shit into my veins insane game
pos,Pos,curry gonna win mvp this year
pos,Pos,really wish we won that pg13 kept us alive in that game
pos,Pos,wow great performance by both teams pg is clutch for hitting that last 3 but curry just on demon time this entire game
pos,Pos,man both of these teams are gonna be great to watch warriors resurgent and clippers still being dogs with both steph and pg possibly gunning for mvp by april
pos,Pos,less turnovers pls
pos,Pos,steph since 2014 has been an absolute treasure to watch draymond was 100 correct in saying that steph doesn t really get the credit he deserves
pos,Pos,worth staying up for skyfucker is on another level
pos,Pos,fair play to the clippers and pg that was a hell of an effort incredible game to watch
pos,Pos,skyfucker did the thing again
neg,Neg,if steph goes over 30 ppg again and the warriors sneak into a top 4 seed i don t think anybody would have a shot at the mvp over em
pos,Pos,okay but that game was fucking great gg skyfucker
pos,Pos,george impact on this game was great his numbers didn t do him any justice
neg,Neg,both these teams are contenders once they get their injured players back
pos,Pos,i wish they d stop switching the camera to klay all the time the man is clearly depressed or just not feeling last year he was smiling laughing and clapping on the bench but now he looks morose every time they switch to him
pos,Pos,fantastic game
pos,Pos,74 8
neg,Neg,
neg,Neg,lol man can t even be mad at the l that was so fucking fun great job to both of these teams
pos,Pos,is it time to be legitimately worried about stephen curry
pos,Pos,man thought all 3 games were gonna be blow outs what a game this one turned out to be
pos,Pos,what a fun game to watch curry is just absolutely unreal
neg,Neg,we truly are blessed to get to watch a player like a curry in our lifetime
neg,Pos,great thing about hd cameras is i saw the light leaving reggie jackson s eyes even with those glasses
pos,Pos,the warriors have already beaten both la teams albeit the clippers without kawhi without klay wiseman and kuminga the offense is just flowing so well with iggy bjelica and others instead of oubre bazemore and wanamaker lot of assist lot of turnovers so far too but as chemistry gets better there ll be less steph has a triple double and a 45 point game still an mvp candidate draymond is his usual self and looks more confident going to the basket when they get the injured players back watch out for the wcf
pos,Pos,steph for mvp
pos,Pos,calling it now if klay comes back healthy this warriors team is gonna go the distance
neg,Neg,both these teams are so fun and good imo
pos,Pos,we had a chance down to the last second sad about the l can t be mad about it though this clips team has no quit missed too many shots also need to never blow three team fouls in 3 seconds again missed batum out there but i liked everything i saw we feel like an actual well built team rather then just a really talented one good game warriors fans your stadium was bumping glad we made you fight for it
pos,Pos,steph is always a joy to watch gg warrior bros
pos,Pos,we get to see steph kd giannis lebron jokic embiid luka in their prime and every team has a superstar man the league is truly in a perfect place
neg,Pos,holy fuck that was nuts
pos,Pos,warriors fuckin deliver
pos,Pos,steph curry the most entertaining player in the nba
pos,Neg,damn i feel bad for pg it feels like the guy never gets calls
pos,Pos,curry went nuclear
pos,Pos,has steph ever had back to back games with double digit rebounds
pos,Neg,could this be curry s best career season i see no fucking reason it couldn t be
neg,Neg,a few days into the season and we ve already seen some insane basketball nba is back bois
pos,Pos,hoooly shit my heart is racing that game was a real rollercoaster of emotions my lord
pos,Pos,i hope iggy s okay
pos,Pos,not even mad gg warriors it was a great game to watch love the nba
pos,Pos,steph being steph but man this 5 out clippers offense is absolutely incredible what a job by ty lue
pos,Neg,crazy how curry shot 16 25 with that 0 7 run in the middle he was insane outside of that small chunk lmao
pos,Pos,ain t nothing better than a stephen curry masterclass performance man i tell you some of the most fun basketball you ll witness because the team and fans feed off that crazy ass energy and it makes the warriors super dangerous
pos,Pos,curry s both dagger 3s to ice the game as usual against the clippers was wild and all i could think was curry probably thinking i own you all my fucking life i still own you
neg,Pos,this warriors squad is super fun to watch the joy steph plays with is fantastic
pos,Pos,steph isn t clutch
pos,Pos,the sky got sufficiently fucked
pos,Pos,may be cherry picked but idc curry now has the 3rd most 45 point games 6 by a player at age 33 or older trailing michael jordan 11 and bernard king 8
pos,Pos,i m so glad they didn t have kawhi serge or batum lol
pos,Pos,the larriors
pos,Pos,s k y f u c k e r sends his regards goddamn i missed seeing this man play
neg,Neg,shit the clippers are still good we barely survived
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i love this team so goddamn much
pos,Neg,curry decided to get hot again to close the game
pos,Pos,lmao chuck was like this game made up for the other two haha
pos,Pos,god i love seeing steph play again
neg,Pos,hey at least clips are gonna show up this season even without kawhi no easy beats gg dubs great game
pos,Pos,curry is an ice cold motherfucker also fuck the refs
neg,Neg,well that takes care of socal next
neg,Neg,is there any scientific data on how the ball always lands in curry direction giving him easy rebounds i swear i never seen this with any player ever it not like he s boxing out people for his rebounds
pos,Neg,comments moving to fast to see that i m gay
pos,Pos,absolutely amazing curry goes off and we still keep it close i ll take it
pos,Pos,he s just so insanely clutch man
pos,Pos,damn that was a good game
pos,Neg,the league needs james wiseman to come back and play rotation minutes
pos,Pos,turnovers almost gave me a heart attack
pos,Pos,steph steph curry curry
pos,Neg,wardell went online again at the right time
pos,Neg,god pg is so smooth i wish i could root for him lol
pos,Pos,that was fun
pos,Pos,really hoping iggy is doing ok he has looked great these first few games
neg,Pos,stephen curry is not human
pos,Pos,curry with the casual 45 bomb
pos,Pos,curry skyfucker
pos,Pos,and people say steph isn t clutch
pos,Neg,that stretch from where the clippers were up 98 90 and went scoreless for like 4 minutes cost them the game
pos,Pos,wardell built diffy
pos,Pos,great game curry not fair
pos,Pos,clippers gonna be a problem this year
neg,Neg,paul george is good at basketball
pos,Pos,clippers are still this scary without kawhi
neg,Pos,the sky was fucked
pos,Pos,what a fuckin game
pos,Pos,we gon be good this year
pos,Pos,stephen wardell curry remember the name
neg,Neg,what a fucking game clippers still look pretty good without kawhi
pos,Pos,this felt like a playoff game ty lue is a master coach shoutout to draymond for getting 10 points
pos,Pos,this is why i love watching steph curry play basketball
pos,Pos,my butt still clenched
pos,Pos,what a game
pos,Pos,clutchmond green showed up tonight
pos,Pos,mama there goes that man
neg,Pos,clippers look a lot better than i expected without ibaka or kawhi some of that was us not having a rim protector but they just have so many good veteran role players and ty lue is a great coach gonna keep an eye on them this year
pos,Pos,goddamn respect to the clips those guys are fighters
pos,Neg,lmao charles and shaq give that man his real meat
pos,Pos,gimme the meat
neg,Neg,wow talk about ups and downs the warriors looked unbeatable then they looked like last year s team clippers have a lot of heart with their athleticism they re legitimately dangerous easy to see how they came back in the playoffs last year during the curry era every so often this has happened an athletic as hell physical team pushes the warriors off their game happened in the play ins last year memphis and the cavs did it in the 2015 playoffs at their best the warriors adjust figure it out tonight i don t know if they did or if curry just remembered that he could hit 40 footers
pos,Pos,steph s on pace to average 10 rebounds a game
pos,Pos,curry on pace for a double double with rebounds season
neg,Neg,how do you go 9 9 in the first quarter and then 7 16 over the next 3 quarters steph only finished the game with 25 shots f vking jordan poole here wasting so many possessions with 4 14 shots and 7 turnovers that s 21 possessions where he only successfully converted on 4 pass the damn ball to steph and get out of the way man with the way he was shooting steph could easily have went for 60 tonight if his team just got out of his way
neg,Pos,curry going for that mvp
pos,Pos,and they don t even have klay back yet o o that is scary
pos,Neg,vintage steph
pos,Pos,my heart hurts
neg,Pos,
neg,Neg,pg no fts lmao
neg,Pos,steph isn t clutch
pos,Pos,paul george and curry playing mvp level this season will be amazing
pos,Pos,a hat tip to steph that man is a straight up sniper either way i can t be too bummed about my clips losing tonight the fact they made a game and nearly taking it shows they re prepped this season whether kawhi makes it or not pleased with bledsoe s return and t mann and reggie picking up where they left off george still proving the doubters wrong
pos,Pos,i need a cigarette lol what a game
pos,Pos,knicks vs celtics last night then this we re in for the best season in some time
pos,Pos,every game felt like a playoffs game lol
pos,Neg,curry mvp
pos,Pos,what a game we re back lol
neg,Pos,curry looking amazing
pos,Pos,what a game warriors got me real scared with so many turnovers after 1st quarter curry man
pos,Pos,amazing game last two minutes were great especially since there wasn t so much stoppage
pos,Pos,both teams with stuff to be excited about what a game
pos,Pos,this is the ending everyone expected after the first quarter right
pos,Pos,both these teams could be scary this year imo
pos,Pos,these early games have been intense
neg,Pos,if you don t like this you don t like nba basketball
pos,Pos,what a way to bounce back from last game curry is nuts but we already knew that
pos,Pos,that play where terrance mann passed it to paul george while he was double teamed on the sideline just a killer mistake down the stretch that whole play just fell apart pg13 has got to be able to handle the trap on the pnr better
pos,Pos,sc30 for mvp
pos,Pos,the cheerleaders trying to get out on the court while the players are high fiving immediately after the game reminds me of the band running on the field in that stanford game
pos,Pos,steph starting that mvp run early
pos,Pos,sky fucker is back
pos,Pos,gg i knew curry would bounce back from his performance last game but the fuck why would it be against us
neg,Neg,i ve never been more confident in 2 curry 3 s than those last 2 phew what a game
pos,Pos,where was marcus morris headband and bledsoe plays well i think
pos,Pos,wardell
pos,Pos,i love paul george he s probably my favorite player to watch from a different team the clippers seems like they are still going to have a good year without kawaii
pos,Pos,my heart
pos,Pos,glad to have a game that wasn t a blowout
pos,Pos,a1 game nba is back baby
neg,Pos,wild
neg,Neg,the first game we had the disaster 3pt shooting night tonight we had the turnovers so stoked we came out with wins in both
pos,Pos,not to overhype but the warriors are currently on pace to be an 82 win team curry is back baby
pos,Pos,the warriors got away with 20 turnovers lol
pos,Pos,73 9
pos,Neg,where the fuck are the other warrior shooters like goddamn even dray had to do points to get it awesome game anyways
pos,Pos,watching stephen curry play basketball is one of the highlights of my week the man is the single greatest offensive player i ve ever seen in my life
neg,Pos,wwarriors
pos,Pos,damn warriors cost me had the 3
neg,Pos,curry
pos,Pos,hell of a game good game warriors nailbiter at the end super fun to watch

pos,Pos,nice to see julius randle hasn t stopped being good at basketball like many thought he would be
pos,Pos,pinching myself with this team man
neg,Neg,i feel for orlando fans usually when we have a shit year i don t check out until 20 games in this feels like a dont even bother year for them

pos,Pos,these magic announcers just having a casual conversation lmao actually very pleasant to listen to
pos,Pos,lol we are so horrendously bad like we are gonna push for the wl record this season
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i want the boys to continue kicking that orlando magic ass so we can see some mcbride and grimes in the 2nd half throw them out there with sims toppin and iq let s fucking go
pos,Pos,randle and fournier have a lot of chemistry already
neg,Pos,magic came out in the 2nd half looking like a different team lot more intensity bodes well for mosley s coaching ability
pos,Pos,ty obi
pos,Neg,let s fucking go knicks
pos,Pos,i don t know how to act right now i m honestly just not used to being on this end of a blowout
pos,Pos,on espn rj barrett has no dots between the r and the j but r j hampton does
pos,Pos,17 18 suns vs 21 22 magic who wins
pos,Pos,hearing thibs screaming while the knicks are blowing them out is music to my ears
pos,Pos,get topped
pos,Neg,that video of knicks fans after winning the season opener

pos,Pos,i am liking the mo bamba trebuchet threes
pos,Pos,i m so happy i can cry
pos,Pos,hopefully the game stays this way so thibs doesn t have to play randle 40 min xd
pos,Pos,i tried watching the 1st quarter that might be the worst looking team i ve seen in the nba in years not even close to a pro level of play it s embarrassing how can the magic get double digit wins with how they re constructed i find it highly unlikely
pos,Pos,god damn this team is going to be really good this year
pos,Pos,sims only played 7 minutes in the opener but he was hustling like mad out there i ve really been liking what i ve been seeing from him so far
pos,Pos,don t call it a comeback
neg,Pos,thank god thibs waited for a injury before calling a fucking timeout especially after how shitty they played the 3rd q
pos,Pos,franz looks fantastic
pos,Pos,ball dont lie nerds
neg,Pos,the human victory cigar kevin knox

neg,Neg,wer is markelle faultz
neg,Neg,uh oh
pos,Pos,we can t even get rebounds off a miss rn x_x
pos,Pos,cole anthony is the knicks 6th man tonight
pos,Pos,orlando magic needs mickey williams
pos,Pos,obviously everybody knew the magic would be bad this year but this is really bad who is even the best player on this team
pos,Pos,damn is there a single magic fan in the arena that s a bitch move to punk randle like that

pos,Pos,this is a game the wizards would ve lost in previous years loving what i m seeing from wes unseld jr already
neg,Neg,duarte led the pacers in minutes that s pretty cool to see he is getting a lot of playing time already in his first 2 games
neg,Neg,kyle kuzma 3rd team all nba
pos,Pos,call me salty as all hell but that was an amazing game until the refs called very very questionable charge calls at the end stuff you wouldn t expect to see in the final minute of an ot game wizards much better without westbrook btw edit look at this bullshit
pos,Neg,our offense feels vastly improved since last year dinwiddie is the truth
pos,Pos,kyle kuzma transformed into kazuma kiryu
pos,Pos,wizards got a squad
pos,Pos,this post game thread will be totally civil lol gg pacers bit unlucky with some stuff called late but well fought battle
pos,Pos,didn t watch so idk but it looks like kuzma had a good game but he s got the worst
pos,Neg,pacers 2 points away from being 2 0
pos,Pos,we arent winning with our trash third quarters idc about refs we didnt deserve that win gg wizards you always kick our ass
neg,Neg,myles turner dropped 40 and not a single post all game from anybody about it nobody really does care about indiana
pos,Neg,some tremendous calls by the refs at the end there
pos,Pos,pain
pos,Pos,dinwiddie is that dude
neg,Pos,we want brooklyn clap clap clapclapclap we want brooklyn clap clap clapclapclap
neg,Neg,spencer dinwiddie
neg,Neg,pacers fans complaining about the refs when turner should have had about 14 fouls in regulation take that l
pos,Pos,i don t want to overreact but we re never losing again
neg,Pos,now there s the wiz i know and love lol
pos,Pos,we may never lose again
neg,Pos,i hope the nba is proud of these refs what a load of bullshit
pos,Pos,pavers gonna pain
pos,Pos,windiddie does it again
pos,Pos,now out of the lakers zo caruso kuzma isnt a scrub anymore
pos,Pos,very happy for kuz i hope exceeds even the wildest of expectations
pos,Pos,team is free from wb and can finally heal
neg,Pos,pacers got done dirty with those offensive fouls
pos,Neg,shoutout to the refs that ot was fucking terrible
neg,Pos,some beautiful refball there at the end to decide the game nice
pos,Pos,refs stole the game at the end with back to back offensive fouls exciting game regardless
pos,Pos,refs we had a meeting yall aint supposed to call that stuff anymore
pos,Pos,aaron is the superior holiday
pos,Pos,the wizards are 2 0
pos,Pos,what a win
pos,Pos,the game was in the bag for the pacers until the refs decided they wanted to manipulate proceedings
neg,Neg,2 starters out and 9 v 4 when lambs on the court v excited to get healthy and who am i kidding does the pain ever stop
pos,Pos,i hate this team someone kill me
pos,Pos,what a wild fucking box score
pos,Pos,kuzma 12
pos,Pos,2 0
pos,Pos,pain
pos,Pos,wizards are 2 0 to start the season this is the worst timeline
neg,Neg,did pacers get worse under carlisle
pos,Pos,it was a good game until rubio s and the rest of the cavs brain broke for 2 minutes mobley is going to be a star sexton is a monster love is washed the cavs would be so much better if they had a decent sf oubre and bridges were great lamelo did lots of lamelo stuff
pos,Pos,that one minute of absolute swarming defence by charlotte was amazing and helped the hornets run away with this game a 15 0 run in 2 14 at one stage 9 47 left mason plumlee steals cody martin scores a 2 9 19 left lamelo ball steals gordon hayward scores 2 9 11 left lamelo ball steals cody martin scores a 2 8 44 left lamelo ball steals gordon hayward scores a 3
neg,Pos,i haven t been this excited for a season in a while
neg,Pos,lamelo singlehandedly murdering me in fantasy tonight
pos,Pos,that run where the cavs were being careless af with the ball and we got 5 straight steals was hilarious cody martin with two positive games in a row
pos,Pos,hornets basketball is beautiful they are definitely a team to watch when your team is not playing
pos,Neg,dang we looked pretty good imo but the sequence where the cavs turned it over 6 times in 3 minutes is what really put this one away
pos,Pos,haters would say we aren t the best team on the nba right now
pos,Neg,lamelo is so fluid right now he can easily slide down through my pipes
pos,Pos,lamelo with 5 steals always good to see
pos,Pos,kevin love stinks
pos,Pos,can t wait for people to blame sexton for this loss despite the fact that he went off for an efficient 33 points and everybody else kept chucking up bricks off his passes
pos,Pos,hornets ball movement is really good definitely worth the watch
pos,Pos,b o n k
pos,Pos,buzz buzz undefeated
pos,Pos,2 0 2 44 of the way to a perfect season
pos,Pos,ricky rubio and collin sexton are guaranteed to hit all their shots against the hornets
pos,Pos,good game for three quarters the start of the fourth was awwwful cavs are so soft can t be getting out rebounded like that
neg,Pos,betters crying tonight line was 18 5pts for lamelo
neg,Neg,i will never shit on mb again for the sga trade dude is perfect with lamelo and are the future of the squad
pos,Pos,i genuinley think just abt every stat lamelo recorded was a highlight
pos,Pos,i really hope the oubre haters were watching tonight i know he deserves his rep to an extent but he s our guy now and i have faith he s gonna turn the corner from last year incredible game from him especially in the first half
pos,Pos,miles mip take it to the bank the guy can hoop
pos,Pos,charlotte bonknets
pos,Neg,good way to start the season really interested to see how the team progresses
pos,Pos,fuck mip give him mvp
pos,Pos,we had to bonk sexland had to
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,man too bad cavs and raptors games are at the same time gotta go back and watch these evan mobley highlights stat lines in both these games look great
neg,Neg,how the fuck you lose by 68 and then win 2 in a row
pos,Pos,lamelo with 5 steals i wonder if he got advice from gelo lol
pos,Pos,didn t they not come to an extension agreement for bridges this offseason
pos,Pos,why doesn t bouknight play
pos,Pos,we look fucking toast on defense and way too many turnovers on the other end gg raps
neg,Neg,that was one of the nba games i ve seen
pos,Pos,scottie barnes is the real fucking deal
pos,Pos,scottie does every little thing on the court his ball iq is crazy his intangibles crazy he even hunts down his shot at any sign of clear space and his mechanics are consistent all this and hes 6 9 as a pg but not playing pg given the talent available hes gonna be great
pos,Pos,we got our giannis
pos,Pos,fred and og were both lacking on offense tonight but the whole team looked locked in on defense scottie barnes really showing what the raps saw in him love his fit with this team first game was definitely rough but this team definitely has play off aspirations even with the east looking stronger than it has in probably a decade excited to see how they look once siakam is back in the lineup
pos,Pos,they gave masai 1 lottery pick and he got magic johnson
pos,Pos,what a disgraceful performance by the celtics how do you allow yourself to get blown out by 33 points at home
pos,Pos,scottie barnes
pos,Neg,agenda is being switched from og mip to scottie barnes mvp
neg,Pos,best win of the season holy shit barnes was amazing tonight
pos,Pos,thank you aaron baynes
neg,Pos,scotte barnes looking smooth af why do i ever doubt masai
pos,Pos,i think i figured out the secret formula for losing basketball games 25 tos giving up 21 offensive rebounds and only getting to the line 11 times sheeeesh
pos,Pos,scottie barnes
pos,Pos,scottie barnes was the best player on the floor tonight
neg,Pos,boston celtics basketball is back
pos,Pos,raps fans get in here scottie barnes coming out party time to overreact
pos,Pos,that was a fucking beat down i was not expecting this after the way the game started
pos,Neg,raptors my 2nd team with scottie kid is a star and always has been
neg,Neg,season
pos,Pos,i have lasting images of scottie barnes chris boucher khem birch precious achiuwa murdering us on the offensive glass as well as gary trent jr getting to the rim at will on us
pos,Pos,scottie b with the double double tim hortons better be calling this man for a sponsorship asap
pos,Pos,i wouldn t have predicted this result after thursday but fuck me that second half from the celtics was awful scottie barnes is going to be a hell of a player
pos,Pos,wizards good
pos,Pos,tatums body language throughout that 3rd quarter when he wasn t getting calls wasn t great the whole team seemed defeated midway through that quarter good effort by toronto
pos,Pos,good job raptors i love you
pos,Pos,second time paul pierce shat himself at td
pos,Pos,what a fucking steal scottie b nba been sleeping
pos,Neg,scottie barnes is an american professional basketball player for the toronto raptors of the national basketball association
pos,Pos,that scottie barnes guy is pretty good
pos,Pos,china not missing anything
pos,Neg,this team when spicy comes back is going to be a nightmare for everyone else on defense we may not score consistently but neither will you
neg,Pos,scottie barnes the winter soldier
pos,Pos,scottie barnes
neg,Pos,i like the celtics but because of bill simmons i like seeing them lose he had so much irrational confidence in them this season
pos,Pos,our defense is fucking elite
pos,Pos,wtf ime did an awful job managing this game he s new hopefully he ll figure it out but we were fully healthy for the first time in over a year and he chose to have a significant heigh disadvantage for a huge chunk of the second quarter more problems that that obviously but it was pretty discouraging to watch us have an obvious problem getting rebounds let a lead balloon and do nothing to stop it not even a timeout
neg,Pos,scottie barnes he special
pos,Pos,we just beat the celtics by 32 points without our best player edit they re booing their team off the floor
neg,Pos,tatum vs barnes was a fun duel
pos,Pos,board men get paid
pos,Neg,as a heat fan im glad to see precious growing no one wanted him to be a bust and glad to see he is showing up strong that he isnt just sad he couldnt develop with us because he was so far behind bam on the rotation
pos,Pos,we don t suck
pos,Pos,scottie barnes is just incredible man i m so excited to see this kids potential as the season goes on
pos,Pos,scottie barnes is just fun to watch and i m ready to fill the kyle lowry booty shaped hole in my heart with his highlights
pos,Pos,you ve been locked up the 6 9 long boiss
neg,Neg,i think i might be out on ime literally the worst celtics game that i ve ever watched in my life 30 pieced by the siakamless raptors at home foh
pos,Pos,scottie barnes
pos,Neg,this was their vision
pos,Pos,long boys for the win shooting still looks pretty bad but the long boys out rebounded and out defended the celtics by a mile lmao to all those people calling scottie a bust
pos,Pos,what a w scottie barnes gtj fvv and precious looked great
neg,Pos,i m frothing at the seams
pos,Pos,i m never going to question masai again
pos,Pos,after boston blowing us out by similar margins for 2 years including on our second christmas day game ever this was largely satisfying
pos,Pos,scottish barnacles
pos,Pos,25 and 13 in his second game while guarding the js
pos,Neg,this was the easiest win against the celtics that i ve seen in awhile
pos,Pos,i am now a scottie barnes stan account
pos,Pos,scottie fucking barnes
pos,Pos,raps win scottie is going be hell of a player
pos,Pos,verticality horizontally toronto basketball
pos,Pos,i would die for scottie barnes
pos,Pos,celtics going 0 82 fr man
pos,Pos,a fully healthy cellies team lost to a team that lost to the wizards lmao
neg,Neg,lotta cs fans shitting on og but he scored 5 more points than brown
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,pretty surprised by the outcome raps impressed in some areas tonight but this game mostly came down to celtics complete lack of defense and urgency
pos,Neg,scottie snubbed on all time 75
neg,Pos,great defense dominated the offense boards and great game by gtj and barnes i m sad as a fvv og fantasy man tho
neg,Pos,how do we go from being down two midway in the third to get blown out by 33
neg,Neg,well this is less than ideal
pos,Pos,time for these celtics to disband
neg,Pos,i love that kid scottie barnes he has so much swagger and energy so much passion and love for the game he rubbed his nuts all over boston celtic s faces in toronto dominion garden their home opener he a rookie in his second game sushed their bench who were talking smack after draining a deep two calmly that is moxy love it 2nd greatest loss on boston s home court in over 50 years
pos,Pos,scott b
neg,Pos,almost felt bad for the celtics
pos,Pos,omg barnes is gonna be a great player
pos,Pos,raptors d and rebounding is pretty good 2 game sample our offense is gonna get ugly sometimes
neg,Neg,man we can t rely on old al horford to be our highest energy player
pos,Pos,raptors defense could be great
pos,Pos,both teams shot similar enough fg but raps got so many second chance points unreal coming from a year where we were a trash fire on the boards
neg,Neg,young scotty got the league on notice
neg,Pos,celtics are imploding you love to see it
pos,Pos,scottie drops his fat load on tatum and we hand the celtics a massive l to start their season 0 2 lmao i fucking love it
pos,Pos,love the boos
pos,Pos,scottie is unbelievable give him roty already
pos,Pos,fack you paul pierce
neg,Neg,boston is a play in team this year
pos,Pos,what a complete opposite performance from last game lol so much fun and i love being wrong about the scottie barnes pick what a player
pos,Neg,scottieeeee
neg,Neg,more importantly alvin williams got his first win
pos,Pos,first options scottie is best scottie
pos,Pos,where s a clip of the left hand no look pass
neg,Neg,after our tragic home opener loss against the wiz i was expecting a boston blowout with tatum feasting what happened was our massive wingspan defensive minded team started to gel and find their spots this could be a special season yes i am here to overreact
pos,Pos,ahhhhh look at my fucking name scottie barnes is that guy
neg,Neg,faded me
pos,Pos,raptors are quite a defensive force when they play hard its shades of their team from 2 years ago in that respect barnes already plays like a 3 4 year vet i dunno what boston can do to really improve their roster they have to find a way to retool and build around tatum
neg,Neg,jaylen brown is either sink or swim when he s shooting holy shit lol
neg,Pos,man horford still doin work double double and 5 blocks
pos,Pos,now you missing your old coach huh
pos,Neg,young scottie pip
neg,Pos,21 offensive rebounds most of last season was a struggle to get 10 so much more presence on the boards
neg,Neg,scottieeee
neg,Pos,when can we start pointing fingers at the core four of brad tatum brown and smart can t blame kemba can t blame kyrie can t blame ainge or we going to toss ime under the bus
pos,Pos,jesus boston what happened
pos,Pos,i love scottie
pos,Pos,fuck boston
neg,Pos,they just didn t look good no other way to put it the good news is our sub has over 40 qualified gms who are here to tell you we needed to fire ime and hire mike gorman as coach yesterday
pos,Neg,congratulations celtics bros you ve been barnes d
pos,Pos,this the same jaylen brown that went crazy on the knicks
pos,Pos,jaylen no
pos,Pos,truly otherworldly brown has 43 against the knicks then rolls out a fat dud with 9 tonight also where is jayson tatum dude looked like he couldn t ball like he did last year
pos,Pos,well i m buying a scottie barnes jersey
pos,Pos,lmaoooo
neg,Pos,lloston
pos,Pos,that was some brutal turnover generation
pos,Pos,someone check on bill simmons
neg,Pos,i m not sure i can really fathom doing that little on offense if you run the offense like smart is supposed to be doing lol i didn t watch but that just looks like an awful game
pos,Pos,2 ugly losses for us smh
pos,Pos,celshits fans in shambles
neg,Neg,barnes tatum
neg,Pos,the celtics might never win another game ever again
neg,Pos,imagine if the raptors stars start contributing on offense i can t believe scottie only had two assists he always seemed to make the right decisions with the ball so i imagine that number will be consistently higher a great win but with enough problem areas for the team to work on boston fans brown isn t the same guy right now he s obviously struggling with some long covid stuff right i hope he can get back in form quickly
neg,Pos,udoka is overrated terrible lineups and played tatum for 50 minutes the game after a double ot matchup that s how you get your players hurt
pos,Pos,why couldn t we do this on opening night
pos,Pos,meanwhile jalen suggs is awful
neg,Neg,i need to be negative more often
pos,Pos,scottie barnes is a toronto raptor
pos,Neg,usually we get our asses beat by boston
neg,Neg,celtics lost to the raptors lmaooooo
pos,Pos,celtics fucking suck ime udoka should be slapped in the face
pos,Pos,i always knew we would be a top seed this season yup ignore my previous comments
pos,Pos,that s my roy
pos,Neg,scottie doesn t know
pos,Pos,having the goat scottie barnes makes things a lot easier
pos,Neg,over under on games left before udoka firing
pos,Pos,long men
pos,Pos,alright so since last year didn t happen what do we say best of 9 2nd round series and we re both 4 4 now
pos,Pos,pascal fred og scottie is our first option
neg,Neg,literal cardboard cutouts of the celtics would defend better than the actual celtics fml
neg,Pos,raptors 60 rebounds keep it going
pos,Pos,shocked that we blew out out the celtics scottie barnes is already so good and has a great feel for the game
pos,Pos,celtics coach has a long way to go that was some bizarre moves all game long you have to get pritchard out and play richardson with tatum and brown more also too many back and forth subbing that team has no way to get into a flow
neg,Neg,bill simmons in shambles
neg,Neg,i liked this game more than the last one
pos,Pos,the hell happened here
pos,Pos,ben simmons do you think doc rivers is capable of coaching this team to a championship
pos,Neg,danny green had 3 airballs lol he was getting booed after the 3rd one
pos,Pos,huh how did the 76ers lose that game
pos,Pos,patty mills hasn t missed a 3 in over 5 months
neg,Neg,i know a lot of you are gonna blame doc and danny on this loss but i will too
pos,Pos,doc rivers and choking name a more iconic duo
pos,Pos,doc s gonna have to use that saved up challenge for his termination if he s not careful edit shout out to danny how many more will he miss green for reprising his bubble role
neg,Neg,kevin durant good
pos,Pos,two calls were questionable doc did not use his challenge for one of them the 76ers went 5 minutes without scoring the refs were terrible but this was a choke job by the 76ers
pos,Pos,even when kd is bad he s still good sustained excellence
neg,Neg,how do you let lamarcus aldridge outscore your whole team 9 1 in the last 5 minutes of a game
pos,Pos,doc rivers is so bad in pivotal moments
pos,Pos,how the fuck did we win that game
pos,Pos,the sixers were up 108 98
pos,Neg,doc rivers has a challenge decides not to use it
pos,Pos,i know people will blame doc but bruh danny green three airballs and the third one was a confident one like he was shooting 5 5 from three gave brooklyn the momentum and a terrible pass by thybulle as well he wasn t even looking their individual play in the clutch was terrible lma was huge in the 4th he won them the game
pos,Pos,harden will be fine in a few weeks they said he didn t get to play ball for real until camp so it makes sense why he looks so off
pos,Pos,at least they still have their challenge
pos,Neg,doc is wild the nets should have lost this game plenty of favorable calls the role players need to step it up 76ers had plenty of chances to close it out as well good win i guess
neg,Pos,i knew the nets would win once danny green air balled three 3 s back to back the real mvp
pos,Pos,good win by the nets managed to kinda stay in it the whole game without quitting
neg,Neg,somebody check the stands for monstars because danny green forgot how to shoot basketball
neg,Neg,i m not a doc hater like most of the sub but even i have got to say i have no fucking idea why doc didn t challenge
pos,Pos,how many points did the sixers score in the last 6 minutes i think 1
neg,Pos,the man was retired last season and he carried us to the win with 23 points and 5 boards lma wants his ring
pos,Pos,doc rivers masterclass waits until the last 3 minutes to put embiid in does not use his challenge and does terrible timeouts
neg,Pos,just fucking fire doc rivers man this man is so fucking dumb it amazes me every single time
pos,Pos,i was pissed at this game for the first 43 minutes then the last 5 minutes came and man i m happy we don t have danny green and the sixers do dude straight up choked with those airballs nice win on the road
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,is there anything better than a lamarcus aldridge midrange
pos,Neg,if you havent watched harris that much you should be preparing for a 4 point second half me at halftime in the game thread
pos,Pos,on a more positive note patty still 100 from three for the season
pos,Pos,the harden dagger ish pass was beautiful
neg,Pos,why wouldn t doc use the challenge at least stop the nets from rolling they re on fire jesus christ another game lost because of poor execution
neg,Pos,durant is the best player in the nba unbelievable
pos,Pos,lol there were some boneheaded moves by brooklyn especially in the final 5 or so minutes of the game but whatever first w of the season lots of cool stuff exciting stuff but mostly it s just crazy that lma retired with heart problems after a couple games with us last season and now he s back with us and doing what he did tonight kd triple double mills 3s dinwiddie back on the court elsewhere and playing awesome champ brook lopez buying goofy paintings love to see it all now onto the home opener sunday let s go nets brooklyn
neg,Neg,wouldn t blame philly for being irked at the officiating down the stretch but i would start with doc rivers being an idiot and danny green air balling three in a row
pos,Pos,that was actually an unexpected victory so i m glad the boys pulled it out
pos,Pos,brett brown was the problem tho lmao
neg,Pos,at this point i wouldn t be surprised if steve nash was writing the script this season nets pulled of a bad 90 s movie last minute comeback here
neg,Neg,why didn t the doctor challenge green s blocking foul lol instead of up 2 with a chance to ice its suddently down 1
pos,Pos,i appreciate danny green and doc rivers being such good teammates and making sure that ben simmons isn t the only one being booed at sixers games if he comes back
neg,Neg,ben simmons see you need me
pos,Pos,i can t wait to wear my new danny green jersey 3
pos,Neg,doc rivers is dogshit at his job
pos,Pos,doc rivers is going to cost us embiid s best years dude it is his second year in charge and i don t think we ve made any sort of progress towards finding out how to close out games on offense we are going to be so much more exposed for our late game playmaking without simmons there to defend the other team s playmakers
neg,Neg,the only thing doc challenges is ben s effort in practice
neg,Neg,but i thought ben was the reason this team can t close a game seems to me they have a case of the doc rivers
neg,Neg,fire doc
pos,Pos,doc s coaching license should be revoked immediately
pos,Pos,that last minute was fucking terrible all around for the sixers shit coaching shit execution played such a solid game up until the end
pos,Pos,terrible coaching by doc at the end there he could have overturned two calls and decided not to use his challenge for some reason
pos,Pos,ask ben if he wants to try being a player coach for a couple games so if that moves any needles
neg,Neg,spin zone doc danny are just taking the heat off of ben by choking away the home opener on national tv
pos,Neg,wait i stopped watching to play games with friends because i thought we were getting railed damn they pulled it off lol
pos,Neg,damn lma is healthy and kicking ass
pos,Neg,wow the sixers could really benefit from another perimeter defender maybe someone who is eager to facilitate the ball as well
pos,Neg,just turned on the game at the end and that s a tough loss philly fans did ben simmons play well at least
neg,Neg,i haven t seen that many air balls in a looooong time
neg,Neg,danny green masterclass
pos,Pos,i ll take it i guess
pos,Pos,kevin durant is still somehow playing great ball despite an achilles tear like he never left
pos,Pos,i feel nothing i had no expectations so i can t be hurt
neg,Pos,i don t expect kd to get a triple double every night but his assist numbers will go up with kyrie not playing and his and harden s minutes being staggered
pos,Pos,challenges never heard of her doc rivers
pos,Pos,doc fucking sucks and so does danny
pos,Pos,doc would make a great auctioneer with the selling he did tonight
pos,Pos,what happened to the point where philly scores 1 time in 5 minutes
neg,Neg,now i don t like doc rivers at all but he was right in not challenging the danny green blocking foul that was totally a blocking foul his feet weren t set at all and refs have called blocking fouls before on a lot of instances that were better closer to being a charge than that one
pos,Pos,after their game in downtown philadelphia the 76ers visited an orphanage it s heartbreaking to see their sad little faces with no hope said liam aged 6
pos,Pos,things you love to see philly losing
neg,Pos,this sixers team is so bad at closing that their curry cant even hit his clutch free throws
pos,Pos,hilarious that sixers fans were calling this outcome at halftime
neg,Pos,philadelphia is the only city that can lead the nets for the whole game and then not score at all in the last 5 minutes
pos,Pos,refs can actually eat dick for that one bad all night and not sure ive ever seen more fucked up calls in the last two minutes than that if they get that charge or out of bounds right or if doc ever learns what a challenge is we win this also danny like you cant airball three shots in a row homie great game and ends like that what a joke
pos,Pos,sorry haters
pos,Pos,refs are fucking trash doc should ve challenged but at the same time he shouldn t fucking have to clear as day calls and embiid gets hacked and they swallow the whistle absolute horseshit we choked doc sucked but this is a recurring theme in the nba tomorrow they ll release some bullshit 2 minute report showing all the calls that fucked us as a we re sorry but then no ref is held accountable and nothing changes brutal league
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,doc is mentally challenged
neg,Pos,people are gonna overreact to this like i m pissed but we were up on one of the best teams in the league for 47 minutes that finish sucked and can t happen again but their are still 80 games and a couple bad calls at the end that won t happens every game but damn good game nets
neg,Neg,huge comeback win for the nets its shocking that the sixers lost this kd was kd and aldridge saved their asses along with danny green thank god since joe harris is already in playoff form still i m worried for them cuz the sixers weren t even at full strength idk how they re gonna get out of the east having to go thru these guys and the bucks again without irving
neg,Neg,combination of bad calls by the refs or good calls if you re bkn missed challenges by doc an good ol danny green nets had no business winning lol
pos,Neg,random thoughts brk defense is awful their interior defense especially so claxton is cheeks rn why they didnt sign a decent center this past offseason is beyond me 2 game sample size but brk s offense looks better with harden on the bench big yikes atm and mildly concerning going forward joe harris in playoff form rn patty mills signing was one of the best offseason moves dude brings shooting perimeter d and poise all sorely needed harden iso become less effective when the defenders not worried about getting called for a ticky flop foul hardens lack of off ball movement is a problem gums up kill a lot actions because he just floats around the top of the key 3 point line needs to work on back cutting for ez layups when defenders overplay him if kyrie doesnt come back kd s gonna have to hard carry this team talk about shit you wouldnt have expected to say to start the season millsap and lma do the same things for this team why they felt the need to get 2 dudes why they felt the need to get 2 players with so much overlap at a position that isnt super important the stretch 4 5 is kinda headscratching also brk needs wings badly theyves got too many 4 5 s and 1 2 s lma and mills were the unsung heroes tonight ex spurs carrying the nets lmao brk has no answer for embiid other than doubling trapping on the perimeter or swarming him in the post maxey looks solid some youthful hiccups but i can see why they wanted to keep him rip to simmons lol still baffled why dallas traded seth dudes the perfect spacer for any team looking to go on a deep playoffs run and hes continued to add to his game sixers have an actual bench this year they wont hemorrhage leads as much when embiid sit now sixers biggest issue imo is consistency they have a hard time sustaining good play and tend to bounce between good runs and bad runs their closing play also leaves a lot too be desired wrong guys taking the shots down the stretch also wayyyyyyy too many execution errors on both sides of the ball
neg,Neg,hopefully philly doesn t take their anger on us later in the week
pos,Pos,what happens first doc uses a challenge ben plays a game for the sixers
pos,Pos,i feel like we lost the game when those 3s didn t go in embiid
neg,Pos,danny green with 3 airballs in the 4th quarter a total disasterclass by the 76ers in the last 5 minutes blunder after blunder
pos,Pos,why does doc make it so hard to be an embiid fan
neg,Neg,yeah we don t need ben to choke away games i hate doc
neg,Neg,i m not gonna sit here and act like the nets are these world beaters doc rivers and danny green fucked us
neg,Pos,what s it like to be a sixers fan
pos,Pos,aldridge was huge for brooklyn but danny green and doc made sure they pulled it out
neg,Neg,76ers not learnt anything from their series with the hawks same old issues evident here
pos,Pos,the last 6 minutes emphasize the problems the sixers will face in the playoffs they need a lead guard to go to in clutch situations
neg,Neg,doc rivers
neg,Pos,vintage sixers some things never change
pos,Neg,man we win that if ben isn t ruining the offense late
pos,Pos,as a neutral this game was amazing lol
pos,Pos,like clockwork danny green trending on twitter again poor guy
pos,Pos,absolute collapse by the team but doc giving the nets two possessions without challenging is inexcusable
pos,Pos,said it many times sixers need a closer
neg,Pos,if you didn t know the sixers would lose after going up by 10 in the 4th you simply do not know sixers basketball
pos,Neg,need ben simmons back
neg,Pos,textbook definition of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
pos,Pos,maybe dave jaeger can be for the sixers like nate mcmillan was for the hawks after we fire doc
pos,Neg,well the good news is for simmons is that he isn t really the biggest issue that the sixers need to fix most obviously look at joel s playtime compared to the other starters and even kd harden
pos,Neg,with everything else going on this season i totally forgot that lamarcus aldridge is playing again fuck yeah good for him
neg,Neg,kd had himself a night also aldridge was clutchh but danny wasn t unfortunately
neg,Neg,watching the sixers not able to score against mills aldridge harden carter and not able to get a stop you need more than 1 difference maker no disrespect to mills he played great clutch shooting
neg,Neg,patty yet to miss a 3 this season also all this talk about moving the needle when theres a doc rivers who doesnt seem to move the needle either
pos,Pos,doc rivers blows another lead shocked pikachu face
pos,Pos,3 danny green airballs 2 calls that doc should have challenged so that they can get the ball back 1 terrible outlet pass by thybulle all to convince simmons that they really need him to play
pos,Pos,doc saving his challenges and time outs for the next game
neg,Neg,does patty ever miss wtf
neg,Neg,with patty playing like this brooklyn aren t going to want kyrie back trade him for three potatoes and a warm beer
pos,Pos,where is mr clutch ben simmons didn t like the pressure or something
pos,Pos,is bruce brown injured
pos,Pos,perfect moment to fire doc benamin would like it as well
pos,Neg,patty mills is 10 10 from 3 in the regular season what the fuck
pos,Pos,simmons was terrible this game
neg,Neg,this team chokes with or without simmons
neg,Neg,every day i wake up and choose to care about this team i deserve this
pos,Pos,forget the challenges the sixers crunchtime offense is incredibly incompetent whether simmons is there or not just an embarrassing but really unsurprising meltdown
neg,Neg,same old sixers
pos,Pos,i ll admit the refs were bad but the sixers also were trash offensively down the stretch he
pos,Pos,watching harden s pace during the 3q compared to the 4q is staggering dude was going through the motions after half lol
neg,Pos,we are a bad team but man some of those lineups don t help at all like muscala and deck getting minutes when we are trying to develop young guys
pos,Pos,great win i know we won t have a lot of them but this was great
pos,Pos,okc is the deepest team 15 guys played
pos,Pos,jalen green and kpj played some good defense today benefit of having a 6 6 backcourt it s all effort
pos,Pos,is it just me or is christian wood kind of underrated
pos,Pos,i was not prepared for a fun rockets team this year
pos,Pos,1 0 in the coach gerald green era
pos,Pos,so we suck suck huh
pos,Pos,yikes hope shai bounces back
pos,Pos,it s scary when you think how bad okc played near the end of last season and a good amount of this team played for that end of season team
pos,Pos,i remember when some thunder fans we re saying we could compete for the play in game
pos,Pos,okc might set the record for worst record in nba history
pos,Pos,mann with only 13 minutes and giddy only 19 is disgusting how are they gonna develop if they sit on the bench
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,no more christian wood slander
pos,Neg,why are we only playing kj in garbage time why is silas not running any plays for our pick
pos,Pos,houston with that impressive blowout gotta keep building and their time will come
pos,Pos,i think okc s squad might give the 2011 bobcats a run for their money
pos,Pos,wait houston s using green as a pg instead of sg or just dont care and just put him there
pos,Pos,put the ball in giddeys hands fuck
pos,Pos,thunder deff gotta draft a center next year for sure
pos,Pos,man i m sure glad i m a lakers fan now shew
neg,Neg,well this is a good look for us lol for real though this pretty much establishes that okc will have the worst record in the nba come the end of the season getting blown out by a fellow bottom feeder yikes
pos,Pos,giddey needs to be the pg have shai playing off him dort at 3 and rotate the guards from there you have to give minutes to your main guys and let them work it out not sure what the coach is trying to do with giddey with the way he is playing him and the lack of flow of minutes someone help me understand
pos,Pos,houston has some really nice pieces maybe this becomes a team in 3 years or so
pos,Pos,sga has to hate life right now
pos,Neg,houston is a terrible team so what does that make oklahoma city
pos,Pos,this is an interesting call
pos,Pos,i can t believe this is the team we get to watch after all those years of trash and mediocre ass teams
pos,Pos,billy 100 left the starters in up 25 with 4 minutes to go just so lonzo could get a triple double against his old team in the home opener and i m 100 here for it
pos,Pos,why do all the celtics 15th men go on to become decent rotation players elsewhere and why can t we keep any of these guys who would clearly be better than many of our current options abdel nader pj dozier max strus and now javonte green
neg,Pos,caruso with almost 29 quality minutes off the bench all while getting mvp chants that crowd was hyped and his new teammates and coaches seem to love him the lakers were stupid the lakers we re too poor to afford alex caruso we re a poverty franchise rich paul we want millions more than caruso got for tht the lakers no problem
pos,Pos,lavine is on the same tier as booker and mitchell and has been for nearly 2 years
pos,Neg,lonzo gets his first bulls triple double against his old team with an alley oop to caruso reads like bulls off season fanfic
pos,Pos,we can just fast forward the season to our finals appearance right
pos,Pos,sleeper team of the east im telling you
pos,Pos,put some respect on zachary thomas lavine
pos,Pos,if the defense stays this active the rest of the way we are legit great to see the uc rocking again bulls are going to make a lot of predictions cough hollinger cough look really dumb
pos,Pos,nikola vucevic yelled there you go lonzo ball gave a look of pleasant surprise alex caruso belted we got a fucking squad now and before zach lavine hit the locker room door ex nba star felicio hugged him said y all look so different
neg,Pos,i use to get hyped over walt lemon jr scoring 25 in the g league and having him start for the the bulls a couple of years ago to lonzo throwing lobs to caruso to complete his trip dub man what a turnaround ak has achieved here so quickly bulls byke see red baby
neg,Pos,i gotta start turning a picture of the 2011 team away every time i watch this squad play
pos,Pos,hello i just got out of jail after jordan s second threepeat i see the bulls dynasty still going strong after all this years
neg,Neg,bulls are legitimate i seen too many doubters obviously it s a long season but the chemistry is just gonna get better as the season progresses
pos,Pos,man lavine has been impressive in these 2 games
pos,Pos,triple double ball
pos,Pos,herb jones is nice that s all
pos,Pos,caruso game high 22 book it
neg,Pos,was hoping we d get to see vuc face off against big chungus but a win is a win
pos,Pos,the road to 82 0 will not be blocked today
pos,Pos,that s an amazing stat line from lonzo i m sure he had a little extra motivation tonight
neg,Pos,are we the best team in the league perhaps its not for us to say but yes we are
pos,Pos,caruso 22 off the bench god i miss him
pos,Pos,caruso doing caruso things
pos,Pos,pelicans starters weren t even that bad imo but the bench is anemic
pos,Pos,this is the most fun i ve had watching a bulls team in a decade
pos,Pos,the lonzo and lavine duo should have a fun name
pos,Pos,such a joy to watch
pos,Pos,man i think i ll have to change my flair before long
pos,Neg,i guess i need to start watching bulls games they look so fun to watch
neg,Neg,chicago has a solid team happy for them
neg,Neg,this was the most fun i ve had watching a bulls game is years i love everyone on this roster lavine is so special and lies were told about lonzo our november schedule is so brutal though we ll know how legit this team is by how they handle next month
pos,Pos,cali boys looks good af
neg,Pos,lonzo with no turnovers
neg,Neg,zach is one of the few if only offensive star today who could reasonably win both the three point contest and the dunk contest in the same weekend he s almost like a cheat code you can t guard him like a shooter because he ll drive on you and dunk it and you can t play off of him because he ll just drain shots
pos,Pos,whoever says the bulls can t play defense their defense was stifling tonight stop listening to friedell who actively hates on the bulls
pos,Pos,it feels good man
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,my boy and i was bored and decided to go in person i don t know what the hell happened to zach lavine at the end of the second quarter but it was like a switch was flipped can t wait to see this man at the all star game this year ha great energy at uc tonight i m thinking top 4 seed in the conference
pos,Pos,bulls are gonna flourish this season i would rate them as the fourth top team in the east
pos,Pos,carushow
pos,Pos,the uc was electric tonight i was up in the nosebleeds with some of my squad after lonzo got his triple double they showed lavar on the jumbo tron he got a lot of love from the crowd hahaha
pos,Pos,this team is a never ending highlight reel
pos,Pos,caruso glad to see him balling out but the pain of him leaving the lakers
pos,Neg,bulls are stacked they might be 3rd out east
neg,Pos,no lonzo would not have saved us from this terrible defeat if we had a copy of him on our team and graham played exceptionally well as his replacement 21 6 6 on 55 3pt and a 3
neg,Neg,bulls got a squad now where s that yall look so different copypasta
pos,Pos,i m so glad javonte is shining in chicago
pos,Pos,the most fun i ve had watching the bulls since the first half of that warriors game a few years back
pos,Pos,deballzach
neg,Neg,lamelo and lonzo all stars this year no ben simmons no kyrie
neg,Pos,lavine s gonna be an mvp contender idgaf
neg,Neg,oh god we aren t asscheeks anymore
pos,Pos,pelicans suck griff not long for this world
pos,Pos,we re on pace to reclaim the record for best season ever
neg,Neg,second straight bad vooch game and it never came close to mattering because the bulls are fucking great right now
neg,Pos,the bulls they re back
pos,Pos,a guy named herbert jones had the best for the pelicans
pos,Neg,nothing in this thread about bi posting an efficient 26 8 8
neg,Neg,pelicans had three major issues last year turnovers defense and end of game offense it really feels like they managed to get worse on defense and turnovers and maybe better at late game offense since they got jv you just can t be a good team with the level of defense that they play it s too easy to score against them and it ll be even worse when zion comes back i am not gonna harp on the lonzo ball stuff since no one is going to change their minds at this point but i feel like they really could have used his 0 turnovers 3 steals and overall defensive intensity size on a bright note it seems like the starting guards can hit their threes so far based off of the games played this year they re gonna have another amazing offensive team yet again this year but can you even sniff the playoffs with that kind of defense not like lonzo was a lock down defender though the issue really stems from bi and zion and their lack of a defensive center i just find it hard to believe that they ll just outscore everyone into the playoffs especially when they re going to struggle with turn overs all year long either green is some sort of defensive wizard that ll turn them into a good defensive team bi needs to fucking step up on defense alongside zion or else it just feels like it ll be last year all over again for them
neg,Pos,what are the chances of the bulls going 74 8
pos,Neg,this team mortgaged its future for a second round exit but at least it s fun to watch
neg,Neg,our bench sucks
pos,Pos,who the fuck is herbert jones
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,this is one of those l s you can feel good about we kept it close with the big boys of the west not bad for a team that s rebuilding we need to fix some of our lineups but man jokic is flat out unstoppable hope he snags another mvp
neg,Pos,if keldon johnson makes one more fucking contested floater i m gonna lose my damn mind that boy good
pos,Pos,ain t even mad
pos,Pos,jokic is in mvp form already love to see it except if you re defending him
pos,Pos,battled to the end a lot of good things to take away some bad but overall i like this team s competitiveness gg nuggets bros
pos,Neg,close game throughout jokic is just too good gg nuggs
pos,Pos,jokic is repeating the mvp no one is as consistent as he is and he s been amazing on defense so far
pos,Neg,i can t imagine what it s like to be the fan of an opponent watching jokic there s really nothing you can do to stop him
pos,Pos,spurs played very well though gg guys gave the nuggets all they could handle it took mvp mode by jokic to overcome see you next time
pos,Pos,can confirm jokic is good
pos,Neg,it was close to the end biggest lead was 11 by the nuggets but spurs came back form that pretty close game spurs could be a playoff team this season for sure
neg,Neg,proud of this team for making this competitive but damn jokic is good the second he came back in the fourth it felt like whatever we did was just not going to be enough
neg,Neg,i really hope barton and morris are healthy the whole season barton seems to be making less plays that make you go wtf and morris is a fucking steal mpj had a bad game and i hope he can become a consistent 20 point scorer other than that jokic best player ever
neg,Pos,don t forget the 3 steals and 2 blocks
pos,Pos,jokic is fucking crazy good dude could make a case for back2back though i don t think he will get it again also keldon is a bad man dude is gonna be a star for the spurs
neg,Pos,facu campazzo brings joy to my life
neg,Neg,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray
pos,Pos,lmfao vegas really thought spurs were only winning 22 games this year what the fuck
pos,Neg,we were close and keldon had a monster game but damn you nuggets for depriving us of hoola hooping manu tonight
pos,Pos,turnovers killed the spurs way too many points left on the table to say nothing of the missed 3s which both teams suffered from oh well glad they re at least hanging with the big dogs
neg,Pos,jokic s defense was absolutely ridiculous tonight i ve never seen rim deterrence from him like the last 2 games wtf
pos,Neg,mpj wyd
pos,Pos,you can t even hope to contain him
neg,Neg,damn that call probably didnt make a difference but still pretty annoying
pos,Neg,jokic b2b mvps incoming you ve been warned
neg,Neg,so they changed the jakob out of bounds call but not the monte morris one gg tho denver jokic too op
pos,Neg,pretty sloppy game both ways especially by monte uncharacteristically couldn t hang with jokic down the stretch though
pos,Neg,wtf was mike doing tonight man
pos,Neg,as a nuggets fan who grew up watching my team get their ass handed to them by duncan i look forward to a new generation of spurs fans watching nuggets games against jokic and feeling exactly what i experienced
neg,Neg,jokic is just inevitable i thought we played okay and need to improve our threes also somebody tell pop we need jock to fucking play
neg,Neg,gg nug bros still a bit salty that ag was tryna talk shit to keldon at least he got smoked after tho
neg,Pos,still manifesting my keldon johnson mip szn manifest
neg,Pos,as a young team trying to find our identity i ll take that it was a close game but we ll be back let s go spurs
pos,Pos,also thank you jakob for just covering that rebound line
pos,Pos,jokic was incredible the drop from jakob to drew thad jock is steep
pos,Pos,ggwp denver i ve got to say that jokic is an absolute unit
pos,Pos,just when we thought we didn t need to deal with dirk anymore a better chubbier version pops up to take his place
neg,Neg,jokgod
neg,Pos,despite the loss i m not even mad
pos,Pos,i got mildly excited about mcdermott after the first game five points from the big off season acquisition
pos,Pos,that missed out of bounds call was tough kinda soured the end to a good game
neg,Neg,jokic continuing to prove why he was the mvp
pos,Pos,i saw some interesting calls today i m very much wondering if nba is going to call it this way all the time or today was an exception elbow to the face intentional or unintentional was flagrant all day last year today it wasn t a lot more illegal screens called on spurs i would very much like that this is standard for other games as well i m afraid however that this was just an exception why tf can t players say to their coach that they should challenge the call in the end i think morris just loste the ball went out of bounds and it was somehow nuggets ball
pos,Pos,definitely wasn t the nicest looking game but we got it done
pos,Neg,jokic is just so crazy good wtf
pos,Pos,oh now the season has started for the spurs this team fucking sucks how do you let a single fucking person beat you how micahel porter getting paid millions for 7 fucking points gordon immediately turned into dwight 2 0 after leaving orlando and there was no juhmal thaddeus young fucking sucks and i want to see how damn long people defend bryn i can only do shit when i wear green forbes
pos,Neg,for how long will poeltl be getting quick fouls against jokic and not get some respect from the refs jokic has been getting away with it for 3 yrs now
pos,Pos,we gave up far too many open shots nuggets could ve scored 120 easily if their open 3s went in 20 turnovers is way too much although nuggets weren t much better in both departments though we have stretches where everything is going well but some stretches where we play defense like some high school team we re not a great 3pt shooting team and that s why we exactly need our shooters forbes and doug to shoot well and they shot 1 6 from 3 if they can t shoot there s no justification to keep them in the game for too long given that they are bad defenders as well keldon played excellently white was pretty good dj played well and made some key buckets in the end of the first quarter when momentum was on denver s side but it seems that he still doesn t have a reliable 3pt shot and it s been now a few years that us spurs fans were hoping that he finally develops it as it can turn into a problem when he paased up an open 3 at the end of the game poeltl was good as well but i wish he gets more respect from the refs 2 bullshit quick fouls in the first few minutes others didn t really show up
pos,Pos,sarver needs to send dwight a thank you note because that fight is the only thing espn will be talking about tomorrow
pos,Pos,suns beat the lakers and a damning story about robert sarver is apparently about to break at this point i m just living a wet dream
pos,Pos,this season is going to be toxic af i love it
pos,Neg,lakers network espn is just fucking insufferable
pos,Pos,three years ago losing to the suns typically meant rock bottom for teams and they called team meetings after it glad we could help facilitate that same spirit here tonight
pos,Pos,bridges contract might be a steal
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,this game had fucking everything
neg,Neg,it wasn t as close as it looks
pos,Neg,lakers in the first 3 quarter i sleep lakers down 20 in 4th real shit
pos,Pos,russ misses 5th layup in a row doris burke wow just look at how competitively the lakers are getting their cheeks clapped inside out on national tv tonight really competitive competition they truly were on the floor playing basketball against the opposing team until the end of the game doris
pos,Pos,thoughts and prayers for doris burke she s down bad since her favorite team lost
pos,Neg,the last game lebron james won was in space jam new legacy against al g rhythm
neg,Pos,make russ set some fucking screens
pos,Pos,keep talking about my squad our personnel ages the way he plays he stays injured we re past our time in this league etc etc etc do me one favor please and i mean please keep that same narrative energy when it begins that s all i ask
pos,Neg,might have been the worst commentated game i have ever listened to so clearly biased towards the lakers doris was especially bad
pos,Pos,lakers looked terrible tonight but doris was even worse
pos,Pos,this final score is as misleading as it can be the suns spanked the lakers big time
neg,Neg,entertaining game davis howard get in a sideline scuffle frank vogel gets a tech lebron has a nice block but doesn t cross half court for the whole possession rondo fan sideline incident westbrook offensive foul on a 3 point attempt davis and ayton get into it austin reeves gets double figures
pos,Pos,that was a top 75 hilarious game
neg,Pos,the lakers are what we in the industry would call delicious garbage
pos,Pos,do the suns have any tnt games this season i can t live like this
pos,Pos,this is better than sex
pos,Pos,despite what you may think the worst player on the lakers tonight was doris
pos,Pos,doris fuming the lakers were getting blown out
pos,Pos,i m not sure who hates the lakers more the suns or the lakers themselves
pos,Pos,i don t want to see anyone saying lebron needs help he literally builds these teams
neg,Pos,this has nothing to do with the game but doris burke was really hard to listen to tonight
pos,Pos,i love how westbrook was jumping for rebounds against ad and deandre with no suns anywhere near
pos,Pos,glad i don t have to hear doris anymore tonight
pos,Pos,vogel keeping ad in the game to keep him away from dwight
pos,Pos,lakers are now 0 11 since andre drummond did the thing
pos,Pos,if you exclude about the second and the third quarter the lakers actually won this game
pos,Pos,these teams really don t like each other and i am totally here for it
pos,Pos,leigiveup at his finest tonight
pos,Pos,it takes time for a young team to gel lakers could use some veteran guidance time to sign tnt s kenny smith and sun s legend tom chambers
pos,Pos,the duality of lakers fans
pos,Neg,i typically don t mind doris but she was insufferable tonight
neg,Pos,lakers would of won if ad played
pos,Pos,suns ain t winning tonight if lebron was healthy and anthony davis was playing
pos,Pos,russ is a fucking loser that s what i gotta say about this it only takes one game when it comes to russ to know that he s a detriment to the team he s a detriment to himself i don t know any other player in nba history where the only downside to the player is themselves like literally guy like kyrie him not playing is the issue joel s health zion s weight westbrook being westbrook is only the issue it never seems to be like at the end of the season when you need them most westbrook being westbrook will win you any kind of games no its gonna be what it was last night a game where lebron played fine ad played fine our bench played relatively fine with westbrook 28 26 was it stalled up the court so bad we still lost to a warriors team with 2015 euroleague mvp bjelica out there like he had something to lift playing like he had a purpose i don t understand that when stephen curry is playing bad westbrook plays worse i don t get it i don t understand his mindset i don t understand how this man s brain functions i don t wanna wait i don t wanna wait it through seeking out anything i ve seen what i have to see i m good i don t want it the expletive doesn t learn you don t wanna give him a chance give him a chance of doing what what is he gonna do now that he couldn t do with james harden that he couldn t do with pg and melo the first time that he couldn t do with kevin durant that he couldn t do with bradley beal what is he gonna do now he can t shoot he still can t shoot i d much rather have ben simmons right now i d rather have a expletive that s out there playing d playmaking refusing to miss a shot than have westbrook at this point westbrook shooting is like turning the ball over a westbrook shot is equivalent to a turnover at this point i don t like it my arms are literally sitting in my chair clenching every time he touch the ball i shouldn t watch basketball like that you shouldn t have to clench every time a man touches the basketball that s not fair why we paying you 40 million for my butthole to be buckered that s not fair i don t like it a laker fan reaction after westbrook s debut
neg,Neg,doris burke should now be on the laker local broadcast with her pandering
neg,Neg,doris burke was in full lakers homer mode tonight wtf was that
pos,Pos,my stupid bet with my friend that that lakers won t make the playoffs might actually have some small probability of paying off haha
neg,Neg,this is so wild i checked the stat sheet and apparently ad played i thought he must have been injured since the suns won
neg,Neg,that no call travel at the end lmao
pos,Pos,suns up almost the entire game but announcers only care about the lakers
pos,Pos,doris burkes commentating sucked as much as the lakers did tonight
neg,Neg,austin reaves with the team high of 17 get this guy in the rotation and take out bazemore or bradley
pos,Pos,doris burke s commentary is how i imagine lakers fans talk to their moms when they watch the game before bedtime
pos,Pos,who would u rather have mikal bridges or lebron james and you cant say lebron james
pos,Pos,lakers imploding you love to see it
pos,Pos,holy shit doris burke was unbearable the whole game man from her shitty takes to her voice where she sounds like she got peanut butter stuck on her jowls
neg,Pos,this new lakers squad is mid at best
pos,Neg,one of my main takeaways is that doris burke actually cant be unbias from the love of ad to the love to the lakers to hating fans it actually really got hard listening to her blaming dwight without any knowledge of the situation while ad is chipping and starting fights at anything that walks
neg,Pos,hahahaahahaahahaahhaahahahaaahaaahaaa
pos,Pos,anyone else old enough to remember the kobe nash howard superteam this is the older version of that
pos,Pos,if only rondo could have used those finger guns to make mikal bridges go away
pos,Pos,one thing that was super noticeable was the difference between how these teams are constructed the suns haven t completely gelled yet and booker isn t quite in game shape after covid but that is a well built team and they went and addressed their biggest issue with mcgee with the lakers for whatever reason teams forget that the ability to shoot is the most important skill in the game and they ve got one shooter who came in during garbage time while the suns have a young team with a sprinkle of vet leadership in jae and cp3 the lakers have a geriatric team while the suns know their roles because the team has been built where the roles are obvious the lakers are gonna need to figure them out all the names got people excited but people were looking at the parts not the whole and although i expect them to get a lot better if they buy into vogel s defensive scheme it s gonna be hard af to make the offense any better and it s just gonna be a lot of pnr and iso if this team was collectively ten years younger they could be a great transition team but they can t do that at this point in their career and people are going to blame vogel when this is completely lebron s fault
neg,Pos,well i don t think it s an over reaction to say that s the end of the lakers season
pos,Pos,lakers would ve won this if davis were healthy
pos,Neg,my ass anthony davis is top75 lol
pos,Pos,best lineup is reaves westbrook ad bron and melo just like we all thought it d be
neg,Pos,thank you suns bros very cool
pos,Pos,lebron being your team s best shooter isn t going to cut it also at one point the lakers were outscored 48 6 in the paint with anthony davis lebron james russell westbrook if this team isn t going to play any defense they have to outscore teams ffs
pos,Pos,say what you want about the lakers but they re an nba basketball team
neg,Neg,thanks russ for not choosing the clippers lol
neg,Neg,the expendables aren t looking too hot
pos,Pos,are the mods deleting injury related threads i didn t get a chance to watch the game tonight but as a devout r nba follower i know that the suns can only beat the lakers when lebron and ad are injured anyone have an update on their status praying for a speedy recovery for my two favorite lakers
pos,Pos,but what if ad played
neg,Neg,we re fine
pos,Pos,the score does not tell the story of this game one bit
neg,Neg,from 1 10 how much you think bron regrets taking russ over hield right now
pos,Neg,austin reaves reminds me of some dude playing mycareer on 2k and force trades himself onto the lakers playing with all those hofers on his squad
pos,Pos,mikal bridges might just be one of the best off ball players in the league
pos,Pos,1 yea the guys dont fit yet but we hope they ll come around 2 wtf was doris doing with that biased ass commentating it was like she was masturbating when the lakers got a run or a stop tf
pos,Pos,new szn same vid same fuck the lakers get your sunglasses out fellas it s getting sunny in here
pos,Pos,its only 2 games also tryhard suns
neg,Pos,let s go fuck the lakers and fuck sarver shits lookin up for us boys
pos,Pos,how tf does avery bradley have a 0 0 0 and game worst 25 in 20 minutes
pos,Pos,can t decide between lakers more like llakers and lebron james more like lelose games
neg,Pos,this was a 30 point blowout dont be fooled by the end score
neg,Pos,doris fuckin sucks
neg,Neg,doris burke get your act together
pos,Pos,caruso was the glue holding the lakers together
neg,Pos,lakers weren t good but not biased opinion it felt refs had money on this game with some of the calls and no calls
pos,Pos,those commentators definitely kicked my fuck the lakers into overdrive tonight for sure
pos,Pos,need to use ad to wipe my ass cuz he was charmin ultra soft tonight
pos,Pos,weird one when the actual game wasnt that interesting but on court drama saved it
pos,Neg,no country for old men
pos,Neg,i love that little dance westbrook does after he misses an open layup
neg,Neg,good win for the suns but the lakers looked really good in the 4th q
pos,Pos,lebron lecoach and legm got some work to do
pos,Pos,don t let the score fool you the suns cooked the lakers
pos,Pos,lakers are washed suns will do well kings will qualify for playoffs
neg,Neg,we need a lakers sun s playoff rematch it will be sooo dramatic can t wait for the lebron crowder salsa dance off 2 0
pos,Pos,the score does not tell tha tale
pos,Pos,the centers either need to just let russ get the rebound or russ needs to stop jumping on top of his teammates for a rebound
neg,Neg,lebron is just playing 70 so that westbrook can be traded for ben simmons and then the lakers will be full of klutch guys
pos,Pos,good loss if the lakers want to win stop playing like shit it s simple
pos,Pos,don t let the score fool you the game wasn t that close
pos,Pos,uneventful boring game
pos,Pos,healthy lakers team would have beat the suns in
neg,Pos,so wait a minute lebron needs a loaded superteam in the eastern conference to win
pos,Pos,austin reaves with a 17 in a game we lost by 10
pos,Pos,don t believe that score it wasn t even close
neg,Neg,vogel with the starters in the 4th quarter made the game insufferable it was already over man rest your players and let the other team rest theirs too it was obvious that the suns were playing like it was over and burke and the other dude made it worse doris comments were almost stupid and not funny
neg,Neg,somewhere doris burke will be driving home with a twinkle in her eye as she relieves the moment she never could have dreamed of getting to call a lakers vs lakers game
pos,Pos,it wasn t as close as the score makes it seem
pos,Pos,i know this sub is going to be shitting its pants tonight but these two teams could easily meet in the western conference finals
neg,Neg,phoenix suns own the lakers souls right now it s a heck of a thing to see
neg,Neg,great teams have players that do the little things we don t have those players
pos,Pos,don t let the score fool you the lakers got ran out the gym at home tonight
neg,Pos,massive l
neg,Neg,lakers making me money their last 2 games thank you kyle kuzma
neg,Neg,how many more stinkers before lakers fans hit the panic button
neg,Neg,who on the lakers will be the first to demand a trade lebron ad melo westbrook howard someone else
pos,Pos,this game was a mess idk what the lakers are doing it was an embarrassing and poor effort throughout the entire game just nothing looked good i ll give a shoutout to reaves but this was frustrating
pos,Pos,i just don t know what the lakers were thinking with this roster they could ve had buddy hield i also would have much rather had caruso and kcp than all the role players they added nobody on this team plays defense except for ad dwight and lebron when he tries it is still the lakers and they ll probably be somewhat alright but i do wonder how this defense improved
pos,Pos,i know everyone is going to meme this game for different reasons but man deandre jordan cannot play any significant minutes it would be perfect if ad could just play the 5 and dwight sub him in for 12 min a game i guess its beating a dead horse at this point but ad at 5 makes both sides of the court so much better for the lakers
pos,Pos,i think the lakers might have some chemistry issues
pos,Pos,lmfaoooooo
pos,Pos,lakers might be lucky if they could stay above 500 this season
pos,Neg,lakers come within 12 in the last two minutes after being down 30 then russ airballs a three
neg,Neg,rather watch the game on mute than listen to doris
neg,Neg,these teams legit hate each other the people need a rematch come playoff time
pos,Pos,this is going to be worse than that 2013 la team and 2013 nets team they have no chemistry nor the fire to actually win people talk about how demar going to the bulls made no sense and the fit is bad i know it s just 2 games but demar and lavine have figured out how to play together
pos,Pos,everything is right in the world
pos,Pos,we traded our championship pieces ac kcp for bunch of corpses
neg,Pos,i don t know if the lakers are going to make the playoffs after lebron and ad their starters and bench are really not good very shallow roster
pos,Pos,llakers baby
pos,Pos,this lakers team give the same vibe as the nash dwight lakers
pos,Pos,melo and lemao not a great combo huh
pos,Pos,everyone liked that
neg,Pos,but it s only preseason
pos,Neg,doris burke was absolutely insufferable
pos,Neg,ayton stays sonning ad the best bigs in the league guy held jokic ad to like 50 ts in the playoffs my boy his respect
pos,Neg,doris burke couldn t be more biased if she tried
pos,Pos,bit of a different tone coming from lakers flairs tonight then after our opener on wednesday interesting
neg,Neg,lakers would have won if doris burke was healthy
neg,Pos,doris was terrible tonight
pos,Pos,fuck la lakers and ad are frauds
pos,Pos,doris burke with an all time insufferable performance
pos,Pos,great performance by wb in the 4th to statpad
pos,Pos,i used to like doris but now i find her so annoying and over the top
pos,Neg,great day to be a suns fan fuck the lakers fuck robert sarvers and fuck doris burke
pos,Pos,now that marv is gone i wouod nominate doris as insufferable broadcastee
neg,Pos,lakers are a trash ass over the hill team who thought they d use their established reputations to big time their way to wins except it doesn t work that way a collection of retirees padding their pensions with play styles that don t mix lakers aren t gonna do shit this season
pos,Pos,if there are any laker fans in here still wondering why everyone hates them just look to this game s commentating espn just gargles la s nuts and it s insufferable
pos,Neg,doris is so fucking annoying
neg,Neg,what a strange game
pos,Pos,hahahaha lakers are the favorites
neg,Neg,oh man russ was an assist away from one of his signature triple doubles 15pts 6 15 fg 0 3 3pt 3 8 ft can t believe this dude is getting almost 50m yr
pos,Neg,that was testy
pos,Neg,lol the two no calls in the end refs were trying to go home asap
pos,Neg,chilleeee the boys are fightingggg
pos,Pos,i would have been happy regardless of if we lost because of the sarver news but i m doubly happy now
neg,Neg,why were davis lebron russ in at the end of the game
pos,Pos,what a weird fucking game i think fans of both teams can agree fuck the refs
pos,Pos,this entire fucking team turned into jameis winston when passing the ball upcourt what the fuck was that passing into triple coverage
neg,Neg,harrison barnes with a quiet 25 14 lol
neg,Neg,are the kings actually not terrible
pos,Pos,davion mitchell is going to give nba players nightmares for years to come
neg,Neg,calling it now rudy is never missing a free throw again
pos,Pos,our average margin of defeat to utah last year was like 28 so i m pleased with the effort fox looked like he was hurting after taking a shot from gobert i think we win if he played even average we hit 8 threes all game 2 from barnes in the first few minutes and then 6 from buddy you can t win in the modern nba shooting like that but the fact we were even in it until late was a testament to our defensive improvement davion is legit still super raw offensively but he brings the clamps nice to see haliburton playing more freely too after a poor first game
pos,Pos,too many turnovers against an elite team we fought hard but we shot ourselves in the foot too many times to win this game
pos,Pos,that game was physical and frustrating and they re just straight up better than us lol proud of how they played tonight though very good effort defensively and stayed aggressive just horrible shooting night jazz defense does not help and sloppy passing jazz defense does not help extremely impressed with davion tonight man still got a lot to figure out with the rookie mistakes but the defensive highlight reel is gonna be something from him tonight also richaun fouling out and only getting 17 minutes because of it hurt a lot he was great in that short amount of time i hate playing rudy gobert and i hate how good the jazz are lol
pos,Neg,davion mitchell has got me spooked who is this guy
pos,Pos,rudy gobert remains underrated monster also davion mitchell is an absolute mad man sac really got back to back rooks who are fun as hell
neg,Neg,i think i watched a football game
pos,Pos,i hear davion mitchell pees sitting down because he has clamps for hands
pos,Neg,the real turning point of the game was bagley getting hunted at the end of the 3rd and the jazz went on a run then refball at the beginning of the 4th after that we lost all momentum and had to crawl our way back with holmes in foul trouble people are gonna blame buddy for that awful pass and rightfully so but td had some really dumb plays throughout the game pleasantly surprised to get so many compliments from the jazz broadcast team especially on our defensive effort
neg,Pos,davion mitchell is the real deal
neg,Pos,the biggest fuck you to the nba refs from everyone here on r nba i don t think a single person from either fanbase could enjoy this game
pos,Pos,jingles died for this god rest his soul
pos,Neg,who is better d mitchell or d mitchell
neg,Pos,buddy giveth buddy taketh away as is tradition
neg,Neg,it s a legit privilege to watch davion start his career kings future is starting to finally look bright question for kings fans where are ya ll at with walton at this point still want him gone has he improved much i haven t heard bad things in a while which is a definite upgrade
neg,Neg,i really like this kings squad davion hield fox is dope
pos,Neg,that was a needlessly stressful game thanks to some terrible reffing both ways davion is a beast rudy was off most of the game then locked in and really won us the game at the end clarkson is
pos,Pos,those baylor bears had a real team last year
pos,Pos,imagine d mitchell s offense with d mitchell s defense
pos,Pos,so when do we start the conversation of davion mitchell being possibly the first rookie to make first team all defense
pos,Pos,awfully inconsistent reffing game glad we shoot 3s davion is headed to 1st team all defense i ve never seen anyone lock down donovan like that
pos,Pos,davion mitchell is what jazz fans expected donovan mitchell to be defensively
pos,Pos,hali looks so under control all of the time impressive
neg,Pos,rudy had one of his worst games as a jazz musician in recent memory only to turn into bill russell in the final five minutes this team lives and dies by him
pos,Pos,davion is a beast gg jazzbros what a physical game
pos,Pos,what a miserable win
neg,Neg,rudy gobert has been a fucking monster so far
neg,Neg,at least we didn t get blown out by the jazz like last time now that s improvement fox needs to drop a banger shooting wise and for the love of god cut bagley lmao
neg,Pos,we may have lost but holy shit we fucking bullied the jazz the kings were one of the softest teams defensively last year and we just pushed them around and knocked like 200 balls loose in the paint shame about holmes fouling out so easily it ended up costing us the game but man i m feeling good
pos,Pos,8 36 from the 3 how was it even close
neg,Neg,yo the battles of d mitchell was fun davion is the real deal kings have absolutely slayed the last 2 late lottery picks
pos,Pos,raining long 2 s and floaters fucked rudy and jazz in the first half 2nd half is jc s revenge quarter hield s bad plays didn t help
neg,Pos,horrible passes throughout the game is why the kings lost so many unforced turnovers also fox played his worst game in quite a while
pos,Pos,seriously impressed by davion mitchell s defense if only he can improve his offense
pos,Pos,fuck was that a bad game from the kings there in the 2nd half missed the first half just throwing the ball towards the basket through like 2 3 guys over and over and over again hoping that it goes in or something refs also seemed to be letting it get kinda too physical a lot of the time
pos,Neg,this four headed back court for the kings will be interesting to follow
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,don t be satisfied with this fking loss
pos,Pos,holy fuck that was a lucky break on fox o5 5 assists lmao
pos,Pos,i feel like i just got hit by a truck what a game gg jazz
pos,Pos,hope the kings keep playing hard this year could be a fun team
pos,Pos,fucking terrible game to watch refs were disgustingly bad one of the worst reffed games i ve seen in a while and the kings almost got one straight stolen by the refs just two days ago no rhythm at all called every little tick tack call on the kings while letting fox get mugged every play ejected ingles on a play that had no business being called a flagrant 2 1 yes by the book removed richuan holmes from the game entirely on total horseshit calls all game long he was fucking heated in that game i ve never seen holmes so mad in my life think that says something i think twice they called 3 fouls on the kings in 1 possession missed calls on the other end from time to time as well like fox out of bounds on the baseline extremely inconsistent all around and downright embarrassing for the nba meanwhile the kings shot 20 from 3 on extremely high volume fox had the worst shooting night i may have ever seen from him missing every single thing in the paint the turnovers kings had 15 turnovers and i d wager at least 12 of them were completely unforced on the positive side the kings were in the game until the last minute despite all of the sheer fuckery the whole game against a really fuckin good jazz team if they just cut out some of those horrifically dumb mind boggling turnovers and actually hit a couple shots here and there they win that their defense is massively improved this season thanks in no small part to davion but with just higher effort and communication all around bagley is still dead weight on both ends whadd ya know no wonder he wasn t in the rotation game 1 he s right about the 10th guy on the bench
pos,Pos,i love whiteside there i said it fuck off
pos,Pos,some goddamn awful officiating on both sides missed calls late calls and an extremely questionable objection on ingles all in all it was a great game but could have been amazing had the refs not constantly fucked it up
pos,Pos,i miss you trade package buddy barnes
pos,Pos,whiteside got his revenge
pos,Pos,weird but true fox is playing the worst out of the kings guards rn huge fan of his hope he gets back to form haliburton looked good and mitchell had the best 1 8 shooting game ever
neg,Neg,on fox and his play in the clutch i honestly don t think his style of play is conductive to clutch basketball every time i see him he either defers or makes bad decisions due to mainly poor shooting ability and even open midrange looks like a bad shot reminds me of russ post 2016 where he stuffs the stat sheet before the 4th quarter then starts bricking
pos,Neg,agent of chaos
pos,Pos,evan mobley with 17 11 and 4 blocks in his third professional game
pos,Pos,evan mobley had 17 10 4 with 4 minutes left in the 3rd you d think he did nothing for the rest of the game after ending with 17 11 4 but watching it he was still impactful all over the place keeps the ball moving switches on defense has nutty handles for his size and can move with anyone on the court he s going to be a massive problem
pos,Pos,what are we like 1 3 or 1 4 against the cavs over the past two seasons gg
pos,Pos,ricky rubio is my king also evan mobley is the best rookie we ve had in so goddamn long
neg,Pos,doesn t matter how far we get in the playoffs it seems our achilles heel will always be playing in cleveland for some reason
pos,Pos,mobley is the chosen one
pos,Pos,evan mobley is really fucking good and im really fucking excited
pos,Pos,rubio is a god
pos,Pos,if i was a cavs fan i d be pumped about mobley looked great against us last night looked great against the hawks seems like he can do a bit of everything man
pos,Pos,cavs the type of team you can never underestimate i still remember sexland giving the nets hell last season
pos,Pos,evan mobley is my religion
neg,Pos,mobley is the truth
neg,Neg,the hawks let the cavs go on a 21 0 run at one point this game that s just not ok
neg,Neg,that third quarter was disgusting man
pos,Pos,jarrett allen missed 4 shots what a scrub
neg,Neg,great win on the second night of a back to back and without garland markkanen needs to hit those open shots
pos,Pos,the cavs are a rather likeable team and might have a shot at the playoffs this year colin sexton is so fast that 3 point foul shot call was lame not sure what the cavs player was supposed to do there
pos,Neg,the cavs defense and rebounding look legit
neg,Pos,don t be fooled the east still runs through the land
pos,Pos,wait we played defense we re allowed to do that
pos,Neg,mvpubio
pos,Pos,ricky what a game
pos,Pos,hawks had some of the worst shot selection i ve seen
neg,Neg,can we play that 3rd quarter again please
pos,Neg,ricky is my god
pos,Pos,a soul for a soul
neg,Pos,i was kinda surprised to see the cavs run a 7 man rotation even with garland out then i saw their 9 15 on their roster my god is it bad great w for them tho their style of play will give teams trouble
pos,Pos,this draft class looks pretty good so far
pos,Pos,mobley is very good
pos,Pos,the cavs are getting a little frisky daresay spooky mobley roty rubio mip even though the shots aren t going in yet i ve liked the game over game improvement we re seeing from markkanen the effort is there he s playing hard and not losing his confidence minor sub plot for the cavs this year is kevin love finally buying in to being the vet mentor we ve wanted him to be the last 3 years early returns are positive
pos,Pos,east runs through rubio
pos,Pos,spooky szn indeed
pos,Pos,trae got pieced lmao hawks looked rough got out efforted by the cavs with limited minutes from sexton due to fouls and no garland
pos,Pos,absolutely pathetic from the hawks
pos,Pos,hawks looked really sloppy tonight fouled a lot and the shot selection was subpar
pos,Pos,a win very happy starting to feel that the cavs need to choose between garland or sexton because of consistency
pos,Pos,the cleveland skyline seems to be actually working
pos,Pos,hope this is equivalent exchange i hope the braves win tonight
pos,Pos,i was sure the hawks were gonna win this one and turned it off during halftime i specifically remember how the cavs can t stop the play that ends with a free throw line jumper and the hawks ran it over and over but i m also glad rubio is on my fantasy team he looks like jesus with that beard and hair
pos,Pos,refs really wanted the hawks to make that comeback good shit cavs
pos,Pos,evan mobley is nice as fuck hes what i expected ayton to look like rubio had an amazing game idc if i get 10000 downvotes and flamed for this a fairly refereed game and it isnt a tight win for cleveland that was absolutely shambolic so bad to the point i genuinely wondered if refs dont bet on outcomes of games but make prop bets on free throws fouls gg to cleveland my beef is with the refs tonight the free throw disparity doesn t do justice to just how ridiculous and one sided this refereeing was at one point they called a foul on the hawks 3 or 4 possessions in a row while not calling fouls for the hawks on drives to the rim also three 7 footers running a zone is so op idk how youd even score on that
neg,Pos,man the cavs roster is really testing my knowledge of nba players i m like 90 percent positive i ve played 2k rec with half of the end of the bench dudes on their team
pos,Pos,flashback to 2015
pos,Pos,hawks and trae overrated confirmed
pos,Neg,east is too competitive to drop games to teams like the cavs
pos,Pos,young needs to play better defence
neg,Neg,we played liked shit but also some really suspect officiating
neg,Neg,atlanta exploded last year after injuries from hunter and reddish the two of them have a tunnel vision and reddish is literally one of the worst in the entire league in fg they are much better without the two of them and that will be seen this season the problem is that the two of them suffocate bogdanovic with their selfishness they will not pass the first round if they play like this where bogdanovic is the fifth sixth option
pos,Pos,how the fuck is rubio on the cavs don t they already have a bunch of guards they don t know what to do with
pos,Pos,3 games in 4 days is a way to dive right into the season lol
pos,Pos,d wade with the dnp cd wtf
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,i thought this team disbanded after lebron left
pos,Pos,pro life tip for pacer fans please check your blood pressure after every game this year
pos,Pos,is jimmy ever going to fix that wrist or is his shot just going to be broke going forward
pos,Pos,chris duarte is a rookie playing his 3rd game but he s allowed to take so many shots every player needs coach rick as their coach
neg,Neg,pacers were motivated and played rly well was a classic heat pacers game and it was ugly tyler that dude tho
pos,Pos,duarte with quite the rookie experience already 2 overtimes already and being given the green light to shoot 21 shots in 41 minutes against a good team
pos,Pos,the secret to winning is scoring 8 points in the third quarter
neg,Pos,the real losers are all of us who watched that 3rd quarter
pos,Pos,this season has already aged me by 10 years
pos,Pos,so by elder wand rules the pacers are now the favorites to come out of the east
neg,Pos,absolutely 0 offensive flow same problem we ve had last year lowry out is such a blow to the team
neg,Neg,playing miami is always fucking great to watch reminds me of mid 00s ball
pos,Pos,gg pacers out played us the one bright spot was herro s performance he s definitely leveling up east is going to be a blood bath if we have this many teams contending for top 8 or even top 6 down here in 1 1 mud honestly the most heat thing ever to have a start like this
pos,Pos,luka trae tyler duarte
neg,Pos,pacers heat bucks nets pacers 2021 22 east champs confirmed book it
neg,Pos,blow it up
pos,Pos,gg pacers simply the better team tonight also that third quarter was some of the ugliest basketball i ve ever had to watch
neg,Neg,even as a neutral fan i was testing my hair out at the oshae brissett missed fts in the 4th
pos,Pos,chris duarte
pos,Neg,happy for indy losing the last two games by a point hurts losing several close games sucks bulls experienced that last season and given how tight the playoff race in the east is those are the games that haunts you down the road but indy pulled through and this games help build confidence
pos,Neg,duarte bout to drop 50 twice this season they re giving him the green light like he s the long lost son of carlisle lmao
neg,Pos,pacers are the best team in the nba now
pos,Pos,i honestly think if they continue to put in the work and show out this season it s not unreasonable to put luka and trae in the same conversation as tyler herro
neg,Neg,get healthy pacers if they can do that they re at contenders
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,herro is the best on the heat confirmed
neg,Pos,ayo i miss rick
pos,Pos,if herro keeps this level of play up he s gonna be an all star
pos,Pos,got outplayed and outhustled herro continues to be a bright spot loves to take and make big shots and single handedly extended the game bam needs to give more at the end onto the next gg pacers
pos,Neg,jimmy shot us out of this game like he did against the bucks game 1
pos,Neg,the heat counterpunched well in the 3rd and early 4th quarter to take the lead from 10 points down but the pacers absorbed it and came back strong well earned win by indiana the low score despite the overtime highlights how much of a defensive battle this was for both teams
pos,Pos,bad game from jimmy
pos,Pos,tyler herro being the only bright spot in an otherwise terrible game for the heat
pos,Pos,gg pacers
neg,Neg,pj with a classic zero points in 35 minutes
pos,Pos,tj bubble warren sends his regards to jimmy butler
pos,Pos,gg pacers yall outplayed us your color commentator is dreadful to listen to tho
pos,Pos,huge w pacers bros
pos,Pos,shaq might have had a point
pos,Pos,now people see why miami brought in lowry full time jimmy or herro at the point ain t it and gabe is good in spot minutes
neg,Neg,herro 28 shots yikes edit i watched game he hit some big shots but he was chuckin cmon lol
pos,Pos,i got all the receipts on this sub re tyler herro y all are fucked
neg,Pos,jimmy needs to understand when its not his night and let herro or whoever s hot take the big shots
pos,Pos,that pacers commentator has to be the most blatantly biased commentator i ve ever listen to lmao
neg,Pos,herro out there taking 28 shots to score 30 pts wth are the heats doing
pos,Pos,i thought the heat were going to go 82 0
pos,Pos,herro is the next curry 3 12 3pt okay
neg,Neg,say it with me bubble frauds
neg,Neg,heat defense looked lackluster and without effort tonight hopefully just an outlier game
pos,Pos,gg
pos,Pos,so tyler herro had 30 points only making 3 threes and 10 rebounds but was 15
pos,Pos,thought i m watching an indiana pacers broadcast until i saw on the label it s nba tv commentators saying brick everytime heat misses the bias man
pos,Pos,apparently heat are not going to go 82 0 and are not the best team since the 2917 warriors
pos,Neg,this what happens when you can t face a team missing 6 players lmao heat fans really thought they were good
pos,Neg,ugly loss oh well don t forget we blew the defending champs out by forty two a few nights ago guys were probably just tired from that
pos,Pos,that scottie barnes kid is good man
pos,Neg,this game started like 2 16 in the raptors favour crazy game
neg,Neg,gg mavs thj is a beast and luka could not be slowed down raptors played some great defense unfortunately og had that foul trouble and couldn t keep it going
neg,Pos,barnes offence really is so much more developed than i expected he s still raw but it s an encouraging ass start
pos,Pos,doesn t help when thj turned into prime ray allen but it s gratifying seeing og and fvv looking good and focused despite the loss
neg,Neg,scotty barnes is gonna be a problem in a not too distant future kids a stud
neg,Neg,how is it the fourth day of the season and the raptors have a back to back lol
pos,Pos,course of the game totally changed after og sat on the bench after he got a few fouls nobody else could score efficiently for us tonight and og was ice cold once he came back on defence did its job as best as it could but our offensive woes continue to be our achillies heel no point in bitching about refs some times they help you and some times they hurt you very excited to watch scottie develop hope we get siakam and yuta back soon gg mavs
pos,Pos,barnes needs to be more aggressive
neg,Pos,could be controversial to say but i think luka might be a good basketball player
pos,Pos,is it really a win if you don t play boban no it s not 0 wins coach kidd era
pos,Pos,good adjustment by the mavs to slow the game down on both ends luka and thj dominated that 2nd half
neg,Neg,scottie fucking barnes he s literally our best player his impact on the game is insane
pos,Pos,boxscore won t show it but porziņģis was really good for us tonight 4 blocks and a steal he looked a lot more mobile out there he scored in a number of ways his shot didn t fall 7 20 fg but he persevered and hustled a ton really like what i saw from the unicorn
pos,Pos,17 8 2 6 12 shooting team high 7
pos,Pos,here s your dallas mavs post game summary now in our 6th season 6 did the mavs win first win of the season to keep our sub from imploding any further kidd s first win as the new mavs head coach yo raps got themselves a gem in scottie luka with a near triple double finishing with 27 9 12 started slow but managed to get things going in the 2nd half timmy after having some historically abysmal shooting performances against toronto in the past dude had himself a night with 25pts off of 7 3 s kp looked a tad better tonight compared to last night with 18 10 double double to go with a whopping 4 blocks hopefully his shooting progressing back to the mean soon powell with 11pts going a perfect 3 3 from the field 7 doe doe lastly joined the rest of the starting 5 in double digits with 11 8 we allowed some careless fouls and runs there at the end that kept things close but thankfully for us the clock became our teammate by then hopefully we don t have such a slow start against houston on tuesday
neg,Pos,why does luka stars this bad from 3 every year
pos,Pos,dallas should ve blown their lead like the old days imo
neg,Pos,i ll take the win but it d be cool if we could make a wide open 3
pos,Pos,yo give us dragic
neg,Neg,scottie barnes is legit
pos,Pos,we ll get them next time boys
neg,Neg,luka always kills us but unfortunately thj also killed us tonight
neg,Neg,gg raptors
neg,Pos,when tim hardaway jr is on fire he s on fire it felt like he was using hacks
pos,Pos,i m starting to somehow believe in flight s hyping of scottie
neg,Neg,don t let this loss distract you from the fact that scottie barnes is the roty frontrunner
pos,Pos,you know if our offense can be as good as it was from the 2nd quarter on then i won t have to contemplate drinking during mavs games this season
pos,Neg,still can t tell if jkidd is a good coach luka and hardaway just went nuclear lol
pos,Pos,goran cant guard for shit his minutes should be restricted hard pg duties should go to trent when vanvleet is resting
pos,Pos,luka is nuts our offence was ass in the second half also scottie roty but unironically
neg,Neg,everyone should go watch the 3 scottie barnes plays where he just stronk d through or blew by luka
pos,Pos,luka ran the offense 2nd half and that pretty much was the game from there don t wanna see luka off ball like that until we get a good 2ndary ball handler
pos,Pos,scottie is unironically the roty
pos,Pos,vintage luka is back y all
neg,Pos,scottie with a plus 7 but the fouls some were not deserved imo and the thigh bang kept him out the game could have used him
pos,Pos,one of those games back to back with travel and mavs coming off a bad loss that i expected to lose but they gave me hope until they started slowing down
neg,Neg,just give up on getting stronger if kristaps can get his ball handling back to his rookie skills challenge winning days he will be a fringe all star player
pos,Pos,definitely need yuta and pascal back the wing depth without those guys to fill in isn t there and both guys are getting tired defence slipped as the game went
pos,Pos,luka doncic is the real deal i cant believe phoenix suns passed on this guy worst blunder ever edit scarcramento queengs
pos,Neg,i m not giving this to kidd
neg,Neg,only comebacks are allowed whenever dallas plays in toronto
pos,Pos,our defenders are so physical other teams are going to hate us
pos,Pos,we shouldnt have been doubling luka in the 2nd half it was just free buckets for dallas also refs called stupid shit on my boy og smh
pos,Pos,i couldn t watch but i m surprised to see birch is head of boucher in toronto s rotation what s goin on with that
pos,Pos,mavs were better
pos,Pos,mavs sub in shambles when they can t cry about kidd or kp
pos,Pos,that was one of the most toxic gamethreads i ve ever seen for an early regular season game of all things lol
pos,Pos,good defense held the raptors to 44 2nd half points good bounce back in the second half kp with 18 10 and 4 blocks i wasn t thrilled with the kidd hiring but new coach gm and assistants we lost mosley too means we need time to gel especially with a couple new rotation guys too we need to wait 20 games before having some concrete evaluation and we have a pretty light schedule at first onto the next
pos,Pos,but i thought our season was over after game 1 guys wtf
pos,Pos,did luka thj only play on the floor together tonight are they a tandem now
pos,Pos,tonight s takeaways despite keeping luka at 2 10 from three he still cooked us but also it s luka so it s nothing i wasn t expecting i feel for mavs fans despite winning i d be ripping my hair out watching this team with kidd coaching achiuwa og fred barnes were all awesome barnes in particular is the real deal our entire bench was disappointing tonight flynn not getting any minutes was a head scratcher this was the prototypical gtj game i was expecting after dropping 20 the other night i got shat on by raps fans a month ago for saying this is the usual for him achiuwa being able to step in for birch and vice versa when one is struggling is a breath of fresh air for our c depth nothing of the jv ibaka gasol days but still a breath of fresh air the fan asking luka to sign their raptors jersey is a walking l overall a rough outing but at the same time most of our main guys stepped up the way we needed them to tonight
pos,Neg,t offense was absolute garbage on the 1st half and then we went back to the carlisle luka heliocentric offense of last season and things started to click those stepbacks from the right wing were hard to watch but luka played an overall good game and timmy took over still our 2nd best player
pos,Neg,we had this until we had to take og and barnes out and left doncic free to warm up hard not to feel the refs calling the raps hard and fast initially and not the mavs really hurt our ability to keep up the fight our offense is still rough as hell though might need trevor to poke at nurse s offense a bit more
neg,Pos,kp statpadding at the end lmao
pos,Pos,the raptors are one good player who can shoot away from being a real problem
pos,Pos,kidd we can t rely on 3 pointers to win game mavs win by making 3 in the 2nd half
pos,Pos,anyone else see gtj hook the mavs player arm when gtj was falling down that was a really dangerous play that they called a jump ball
pos,Pos,don t let this win fool you this team still sucks
pos,Pos,raptors fans do you also think your announcers are annoying this wasn t a question that one commentator is definitely annoying
neg,Pos,i was told kidd ruined the offense and mavericks would regress after one game though
pos,Pos,random thoughts luka needs to work on his offseason conditioning and defense cuz his current fitness is just fucking unacceptable for a player of his caliber kp is a fucking statue his defensive limitations will determine how far dallas can go in the playoffs because playoff caliber teams will abuse the shit outta him bullock should probably start in place of dfs no knock on dfs but bullock s skillset would probably fit the starting lineup better hardaway is such a hot and cold player hes either 7 9 or 1 9 very little in between not a huge fan of high variance players like that but when hes on they can beat damn near anybody dallas also has a c problem powells fine as an off the bench energy small ball c but isnt good enough too start get bullied too easily and his offensive game is too limited wcs is just hot sweaty plumber ass and boban s really useful in certain matchups completely useless in others should probably look to acquire a c in buyout by the deadline and ship out wcs if they can klieber is the teams x factor needs more minutes good stuff happens for the most part when hes on the court it took kidd 1 5 games to realize putting the ball in lukas hand more is a good idea this man and nba head coach rofl as an aside id like to see dallas run a small ball closing lineup with luka thj bullock dsf dsf klieber powell klieber once luka s drops weight torontos in a really weird spot teamwise cant tell if they re gonna sell hard at the deadline or look to be buyers to make a playoff push neither would surprise me a lot probably hinges on og s development and whether or not he takes that next step toronto s d is legit they will be a pain in the ass to play against all season also nick nurse is a really good coach tor s lucky to have a guy like that scottie barnes is legit winning player very savvy high bbiq does lots of small things well reminds me of young iguodala toronto s bench was assssssss tonight outside of dragic who quite frankly should play better than he did today they seem pretty thin i atm tf happened to boucher dude was and elite 2way player last year but looks absolutely lost on offense rn
neg,Pos,this kidd experiment survives another day i guess
neg,Pos,toronto you have the absolute worst announcers in pro sports it sounds like you hired tom lichis as your color guy what the fuck is that about
pos,Pos,hey mavs do you guys still want dragic lol
pos,Pos,blech
pos,Pos,scottie for roty that is all
pos,Pos,luka s plan
pos,Pos,dallas was playing atrociously in the first half and we were shooting almost 50 from 3 but refs kept them in the game complete turn around in the second half mavs probably close the gap either way thj went full stephy curry and luka got into his rhythm would be nice to have seen more of scottie and og in the second half too bad refs
neg,Pos,the kidd era officially begins
neg,Neg,why is there a picture of ja morant up there
pos,Pos,u hwjhwueuejejdi i had come for your wrists but looks like you guys won
pos,Pos,damn luka and kristap combined for a 4 19 on 3p shooting
pos,Pos,what happened to luka s 3p 20 kidd gonna make him practice under water for 3 hours i bet
pos,Pos,kidd and porinzgodless should sign a co contract in china that 1st quarter was horrible porzingis post fader brickshow
neg,Pos,i checked and saw we were up a fair bit before i went into work thinking okay we got a 10 point lead we should be fine but that s nothing in todays game i suppose haha
pos,Pos,fire jason kidd because i don t like him
pos,Pos,easily the worst officiated game of the season you have kp throwing people down to the ground by grabbing their necks with 0 calls but then foul out og and scottie from breathing on kp not t a real loss by the raps imo
pos,Neg,toronto fell off hard since losing kawhi daym
pos,Pos,kristaps poristinky
pos,Pos,luka and kp combined 4 19 from 3pt range still win okay thj carrying the mavs then
pos,Pos,detroit scored 26 points in the middle 2 quarters total i want to take it as the bulls defense being really good but also detroit s offense is really not good
neg,Neg,vooch with 18 rebs demar with 21 pts and 6 ast caruso with 5 stl lonzo with 4 blk lavine s got the supporting cast he deserved
pos,Pos,feels really good to win convincingly without zach having to move heaven and earth
pos,Pos,the chicago bulls are good again nature is healing
pos,Neg,2 of our 4 main guys didn t even play well and this was a blowout really good sign
neg,Pos,bulls are smurfing
pos,Pos,caruso s all defence campaign in full swing
pos,Pos,netflix best start filming this team for the next dance
pos,Pos,trying not to overreact too much to performance against bad injured teams but extremely encouraging signs that this defense will be at least average if not outright good probably still a little soft inside but caruso lonzo are absolute dogs on the perimeter and i like the energy activity from a lot of the bench guys as well they will be a disaster on d because of lavine derozan was a lazy narrative imo we were about average last year and upgraded our defensive talent overall
pos,Pos,zach lavine makes his 555th 3 pointer and ties michael jordan for career 3 point fgs in bulls history just over 100 to go to tie scottie pippen 664 for the 3rd spot it might take him the rest of the season to take the career spot held by kirk hinrich 1049 breaking records even on his down nights
pos,Pos,vucevic with 18 rebounds and 15 points nice double double also three assists two steals and three blocks
pos,Pos,bulls have an actual talented cast if there s no injuries they re definitely making the playoffs
pos,Pos,happy vooch will be playing some meaningful games this season he s going to get the attention he deserves
pos,Pos,love me some good deballzach
pos,Pos,i think the plan going forward for chicago is to have lavine demar be 1a and 1b it s clear the ball is going to be in their hands a lot barnes has been fantastic for us next game he s probably going to matchup with demar former face of the franchise vs future face of the franchise let s see how barnes handles this
pos,Pos,looks like my prediction of 50 wins for the bulls is looking good
neg,Pos,the bulls are just iconic man feels literally wrong when they aren t good
neg,Pos,something people have missed in their analysis of the bulls is that this is the first time in a decade where demar s not expected to get the most points for his team in every single game it s the first time he s playing with someone who s actually a better scorer than him since bosh left toronto that in itself frees up so much space for him to operate and keeps him fresher throughout the game the weight of not being the guy externally must also be quite freeing i d imagine but who knows this is obviously zach s team in terms of marketing and leadership long term potential and he s definitely the more well rounded player anyway but think by mid season the actual game plan will clearly treat them as 1a 1b with vuc and zo playing crucial roles as well that s pretty much the case right now but it s more experimental at the moment seeing how everything fits i m very excited to see how this goes if things go just slightly better than expected the ceiling for this team is quite a lot higher than most predictions very much an atlanta suns type situation last year bring on toronto that s always a game that gets demar motivated hopefully a 30 point night coming
neg,Neg,alone atop the east gotta be first time since the year rose tore his acl
pos,Pos,someone tell me who the pistons just lost to
pos,Pos,that basketballgm game i played where bulls threepeated with lavine vucevic and derozan each winning a fmvp is looking more and more realistic lol
neg,Pos,look at caruso with those 5 steals man so inspirational
pos,Pos,the league as a whole is much better when the bulls are competitive
pos,Pos,feels good
pos,Pos,took us about 20 years but we own detroit again
neg,Pos,pain
pos,Pos,this bulls roster is sick
pos,Neg,bulls defense is beyond legit
pos,Pos,go bulls
neg,Pos,carushowwwwww fuckkkkkkk
pos,Pos,don t let this win distract you from the fact that kylian hayes is averaging 1 point per game
pos,Pos,as a pels fan who said all last year how dumb griff was for how he was treating zo i m loving watching zo thrive i just hope the pels lose enough this year to get griff fired before he fully ruins the zion era losing zo coulda been the beginning of the end
pos,Pos,the bulls are really putting on a show this season
pos,Pos,on a night when lavine was off we still blew out the other team love to see it
pos,Pos,bulls are looking a little bit spooky so far
pos,Pos,i like this bulls team this season i hope that they can maintain some momentum
pos,Pos,we re gonna win the league
neg,Neg,are zach and vooh on and off the court at the same time their minutes are exactly the same
pos,Pos,pistons fans is killian hayes a bum ive honestly never watched detroit since before he was drafted but it seems like he always has the worst stat lines
neg,Pos,i m loving these sub 100 point wins
pos,Pos,pistons have a 0 winning percentage against the bulls this season
pos,Pos,as a bucks fan i hate supporting any other team in the east but damn the deballzach show is amazing to watch
pos,Neg,cade still not playing
neg,Neg,this edition of the bulls seems to be an exciting team
pos,Pos,so like what s the best way to watch the bulls now i d pay but it s the only team i care about haven t watched since my man hinrich played
pos,Pos,reason why they doing good is cause they have a nba champion alex the goat caruso
pos,Pos,carushowed up big
pos,Neg,bulls are contenders
neg,Neg,are the 2021 22 bulls the best bulls team ever
pos,Pos,how did killian hayes look
neg,Neg,championship yall book the hotel gonna say this for the next 6 months
neg,Neg,vuc almost had that big beef
pos,Pos,this roster is fun i hope the bulls do well this season
neg,Pos,leballzach strikes again
pos,Neg,our guard rotation is horrid without cade currently defense looked solid for the most part but our offense was horrid tonight extremely stagnant shouts out saddiq though he quietly had 20 and 16 somehow
neg,Neg,hayes sucks and koc is a moron
pos,Pos,top 1 most likable team rightnow chicago bulls
pos,Neg,let s go bulls
pos,Pos,the lonzo lavine caruso javonte pat lineup is going to be demonic va teams who don t have a full blown post up threat and having demar offense and caruso green defense overall aggression as mentors should push pat even further towards the trajectory of being a star
pos,Pos,feel like at least so far there is a slight overreaction with these bulls wins so far they have played the cavs once and the pistons twice these are arguably the 13th and 14th best teams in the east not particularly surprised that they won all three of them i really am just waiting to see how the bulls do against good great competition and how they stack up early results are good but i m not sold until they can consistently take down teams like milwaukee miami golden state utah etc
pos,Pos,82 0 bulls incoming
pos,Pos,i think bulls could be the top 4 of east this season along with bucks sixers and hawks nets are looking for the 5th so they could get the away game advantage
pos,Neg,damn bulls bench is buns
neg,Neg,bulls are a must watch league pass team so far they are just fun if they stay healthy i see them as a lite version of what we expected the nets to be bad defense great offense and it won t be easy to outscore them
pos,Pos,hey mods can we get a spoiler tag or something brit here usually watch games the day after on league pass as 3am is too much dedication for me
pos,Pos,the pistons shot 5 28 for 3 the defence looks pretty good just make a few more threes and it s a ball game bulls perimeter defence is also good but pistons missed some easy shots too all this without the 1st pick i m happy unlike a lot of pistons fans
pos,Pos,cade flop
pos,Pos,bulls 3 peat imminent
pos,Pos,have i been living under a rock when did lonzo join the bulls
pos,Neg,can we start the ac sixth man of the year campaign now go fuckin get em chicago
neg,Neg,they ve played detroit twice and the pelicans not exactly the most difficult schedule to start the season lol
neg,Pos,where did cade fade to
pos,Pos,i m loving ja as the thumbnail for all these posts lmao
pos,Pos,woah
pos,Pos,5 fucking steal just how
pos,Pos,also fun fact as told in one of javale mcgees youtube vlogs zach lavine has never won 4 games straight in his nba career like ever we are on the brink of history
neg,Neg,if detroit gets 1st pick again i m gonna be pissed smh
pos,Pos,did the bulls get to choose their schedule for the opening week of the season
pos,Pos,the schedule sure is a good way to get off to a good start
pos,Pos,that third man offense fell off a cliff but the defense won the game
neg,Pos,30 turnovers would kill anyone but man i m still sad
neg,Neg,hilarious way to end it dlo lmao kat please do not continue to foul out
pos,Pos,i really liked that post game pat beverly interview he s a great addition to the team
pos,Pos,the minnesota timberwolves are a defensive juggernaut and i m turning off box notifications
pos,Pos,first time the wolves won a game with defense in ages
pos,Pos,well that was a mess if it were possible for both teams to record a loss that s what would have happened here
pos,Pos,herb jv and bi deserve better
pos,Pos,some thoughts d lo was horrific for 90 of the game but he showed big time in the 4th quarter like he usually does tbf ant was bad tonight he argued with refs constantly over no calls and wasn t thinking through what he should do on offence kat was a god on offence but his beef with jv surfaces again and he fouled out he needs to learn to keep that shit under wraps or for the wolves to have a james johnson type of guy to go out and beat the shit of jonas so kat doesn t rack up fouls also the refs were fucking dogshit last year this is a game the wolves would have lost 100 though
pos,Pos,that dlo shot was the kinda shot my little cousin makes when he s angry when we bully him on the court then the shot goes in and the game is done then the made shot is the only thing he talks about for the next 3 days love you dlo
neg,Neg,doesn t feel like a win was much closer than it looks shouldn t have been
neg,Neg,live by the dlo die by the dlo
pos,Pos,did any neutral fans sit through this game i feel like that would be impossible
pos,Neg,wolves outscore a team in the paint by 15 half as many fts ant drives to the rim 15 times 0 total fts hey refs get fucked
pos,Neg,the sp00k is back boyz
pos,Pos,on the way up in the west actually cheering for timberwolves to keep it fresh in the west even if you still hate the heat jimmy
pos,Pos,spooky season
pos,Pos,i told y all they making to the playoffs
pos,Pos,if you don t like 30 turnovers and only losing by 7 then you don t like pelicans basketball
neg,Neg,so happy we could pull that out defense is legit also graham is booty isn t he
pos,Pos,this would be a blow out if dlo was hitting his shots early on and not committing silly turnovers he hit his shot late game to win it but we shouldn t even be in that position in the first place
pos,Pos,bruh the offense is lookin a little anemic
pos,Pos,twolves on path to that 82 0 season it s literally math
pos,Pos,pray for ingram and jonas
pos,Pos,never a doubt
pos,Pos,herb jones and tm3 both played with incredible effort tonight especially herb he was a steal in the second round the second chance opportunities he created were crucial to our comeback in the second half i was pleased with the overall effort from the team tonight but the sloppy play and our overall lack of cohesion on offense really killed us i feel like once zion comes back the offense will open up more as players that aren t suited to create shots will be asked to play off of him more but the turnovers need to improve if we wanna win some games this year
pos,Pos,minnesota timberwwo l ves
neg,Neg,man if embiid or jokic played the way kat played tonight they d still be in the game it s just the way officials call him and it s unacceptable
pos,Pos,i m very sad but herb jones was a mf ing beast in that third quarter jeeeez
pos,Pos,man the pels are struggling once we get things firing on all cylinders we are gonna be good
neg,Pos,i m happy for the wolves after being meme d for years they deserve this
pos,Pos,under 2 years til dlo is off a max can t wait
pos,Neg,herb jones is that guy
pos,Pos,god damn the wolves shot like shit and it was hard to watch glad to see the win tho very fun to see them
pos,Neg,we are the worst team in the nba and we re gonna get like the 10th pick in the draft i can t wait
pos,Pos,free brandon ingram
pos,Pos,timberwolves are starting to look spooky
pos,Pos,wolves have a ton of energy but they re pretty erratic that should have been a blowout against zion less pels was really close at the end
pos,Pos,holy fucking shit do we suck something tremendous right now i really just hope this is the learning curve and not just the probable reality that we fucking suck
pos,Pos,pelicans are gonna be the worst team in the league holy fuck i hate this
pos,Neg,free brandon ingram
pos,Pos,zion leavin
pos,Pos,can t win games without your best player
neg,Neg,pels without zion looking like a solid 0 82 team free my boy ingram
pos,Pos,naw can hoop love watching him ingram is so damn good fuck jv go wolves
pos,Pos,30 turnovers by the pelicans ice cold shooting from deep no zion and the wolves at home by 9 the wolves were gifted several baskets too the 1 at the end of the 3rd in particular but they also got at least 3 lucky bounces on triples
pos,Neg,the wolves are back
pos,Pos,devonte graham was awful last year on the hornets what was david griffin thinking
pos,Pos,0 3 lonzo left zion got fat pelicans not happy
pos,Pos,towns is carrying my fantasy team rn
pos,Pos,ugly game let s hope game 1 was a better indication of this team than game 2
pos,Pos,i m glad i didn t get a chance to watch this game i could imagine it was a very disappointing outing for both teams but especially the pelicans
neg,Pos,ja gonna make a big jump this season
pos,Pos,teams where your name ends in s we coming for you
pos,Pos,pat c is the best stretch 5 in the league
pos,Pos,thad plz come to mke
pos,Pos,i m tired of losing to other teams that i legitimately like
pos,Pos,even though we didnt get the win im still proud of us giving the nuggets and bucks a challenge and a bit of a scare we may not have any big names but we give it our all well done bucks
pos,Pos,i love jordan nwora i was already super high on him coming in and he s exceeded my expectations so far this year hustling his ass off playing just about respectable defence moving the ball around the whole lot was particularly impressed toward the end of the 2nd quarter when he had a pretty good look from three but played the touch pass to hill in the corner for an even better look that s exactly the kind of thing we need from our role players and he is absolutely nailing it we haven t had anything resembling a microwave scorer since bud came in but he s the guy no doubt he s going to be a very important player for us sooner rather than later poeltl had a really good game too even if his box score numbers don t really pop aside from the blocks i ve barely watched him since he went to sa but he did a pretty good job on giannis defensively and took advantage of our lack of bigs on the other end when giannis was on the bench as well
pos,Pos,pat connaughton has really gone from why did you give him that contract to one of the biggest underpays in the league
pos,Pos,whoever gave the spurs the nuggets and the bucks on a back to back the first week of the season isn t very nice gg bucks bros
pos,Pos,i love my team we lost two games but i felt good about them we battled till the very end against two important teams with awful mismatches for us the bucks showed us their experience and exposed us inexperience we will just learn from this losses hopefully we will also learn how to shoot that three lmao gg
pos,Pos,iv
pos,Pos,we re scrappy as hell yet somehow completely adverse to willingly taking 3s by anyone not named mcbuckets which with a name like that makes sense so many open 3s we decided to pass up on for a dribble drive in the lane but i love this team we re the walking embodiment of the randy marsh i didn t hear no bell meme and i m 1000 here for it gg bucks bros please win the east again 3
neg,Neg,but seriously who from the bucks organization hurt lonnie
pos,Pos,i honestly think we may have found our 2nd man in kj just waiting for that eventual 2nd year primo jump to franchise player and we are all set
pos,Pos,keldon is proving to be a option in the making just a fearless young man
neg,Neg,smh
pos,Pos,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray
pos,Neg,when s the last time the bucks won in sa before tonight i went to the last few years games and we always played like shit
pos,Pos,just like last night they battled all the way might not have many wins on the board this first stretch of the season but this team s effort and energy has me optimistic that we will be much better than expected gg bucks bros
pos,Pos,we won a game running a lineup with khris middleton at center
pos,Pos,great team effort can t be mad coming off a b2b night and keeping it close on to the next
neg,Pos,best 1 2 team i ve ever come across
pos,Neg,khris middleton better be an all star this year
pos,Pos,shout out for doug mcdermott for choosing to miss in the 4th so the bucks could win as well as the revolving door of spurs players hitting ridiculous contested layups over starting centre pat connaughton nonetheless it feels good to be up 2 0 on the season
pos,Neg,free lonnie only against the bucks and rockets hide him versus the rest of the nba
pos,Neg,not sure if i should cheer for the pacers or the bucks on monday gg to bucks spurs definitely tried hard this game though price of winning a championship
pos,Pos,hoola hooping manu waits another day
pos,Pos,giannis shot 50 from 3
pos,Pos,pat as center wtf
pos,Pos,good to see hoilday back
pos,Pos,i repeat welcome to the mcbuckets club bucks fans
neg,Neg,basketball gods gave this one to bucks literally the only thing that saved them was san antonio going 10 39 from deep if they had shot their season average this would have ended differently
neg,Pos,you know what i ll take losing by 10 only to the defending champions this young core makes me hopeful for the future also jesus christ our schedule is pain
neg,Pos,mmhhh why do i feel like pop bout to trade lonnie and murray for big boi ben
pos,Pos,is cj the best player in the league
pos,Pos,lmao blazers played like the suns poisoned their water supply burned their crops and delivered a plague unto their houses
neg,Pos,runaway win anybody catch a clip of kaminsky s monster miss on that dunk i haven t seen one that open in a while now
pos,Pos,lose to the kings blow out the suns make it make sense
pos,Pos,portland defense looks way better rotations and stuff not perfect but there s passing lanes and driving lanes that your players are covering trying to cover that you guys didn t even attempt to cover last year rotations and help that you guys didn t even try to bring last year are coming you guys also replaced melo kanter with nance zeller two huge negatives on d to two positives on d nance also gives you guys a serviceable small ball 5 when your traditional bigs are getting toasted you guys replaced 48 minutes of garbage defenders with 48 minutes of plus defenders a night
neg,Neg,well idk who s good in the nba
pos,Pos,blazers played amazing tonight
pos,Neg,out of all the suns games that was surely one of them
pos,Pos,he s doing more than trying jennifer
neg,Neg,nice game by the blazers their defense was good nice to a team take advantage of a team coming off a back to back shot at my own team not a shot at the blazers suns
pos,Pos,holy shit where has this blazers team been best all around game in years
neg,Pos,we got clamped man
pos,Pos,the 4th quarter antics with the blazers bench was a lot of fun to watch
pos,Pos,best team game i ve ever seen us play we turned into showtime for a hot minute there with our young guys also ant is for real holy he s taken such a jump nas too the orlando boys are gonna take over the league
pos,Pos,morey didn t like that
neg,Neg,i m not sure and i may be completely wrong but do we actually have a bench now gasp
pos,Pos,this is what portland can be hard to stop great team shooting when they are on
neg,Neg,that was so fucking fun best overall team basketball i ve seen the blazers play in so long it s wild having a blowout w dame only dropping 19 hyped af for this season
pos,Pos,man the second team what an upgrade from kanter and melo those two are possibly top 5 worst defenders in the league
pos,Pos,cj getting that all star campaign going
neg,Neg,props to nurk big man was hustling every second of the game ant nas are the keys to our season
neg,Neg,best win by a team named the trail blazers against a teamed named the suns ive seen all year
neg,Pos,gg blazers no salty here well earned ya ll shot like assasins and completley grounded our offense is what it side this league is wild moving right along
pos,Pos,i had a fantastic time tonight
pos,Pos,the blazers have been saving up defensive energy for nearly a decade time to let it all out terry stotts died for this
pos,Pos,cj with 6 when will olshey get dame some fucking help
pos,Pos,the blazers are confirmed like 70 points better than the lakers
pos,Pos,game 1 loss to sacto blow it up trade dame game 2 win vs suns i wonder what our parade route will be
pos,Neg,this is the type of game they need to have when dame is cold from 3 masterclass performance just hope cj can stay healthy playing at that level
pos,Pos,blazers played excellent defense and seemingly couldn t miss a shot tonight poor game out of the sun s on to the next
pos,Pos,swapping melo and kanter for nance and zeller is a huge defensive upgrade
pos,Pos,well
pos,Pos,elfrid payton putting up almost twice as many shots as the teams star center lol
pos,Pos,i m happy
pos,Pos,so many annoying laker fans in the game thread damn
pos,Pos,1 81 confirmed woe is me
pos,Pos,cj really upping his trade value such that morey would trade simmons for him huh but this time the blazers will say no
pos,Neg,cj has been playing better than dame thus far
pos,Pos,daryl morey in shambles
neg,Pos,damn a 29 point loss and a losing record should the phoenix suns who are absolutely in shambles right now with their only win coming against literally the worst basketball team in not just nba history but all of basketball history finally blow it up and end this experiment
pos,Pos,lakers weren t even playing and doris burke is still going to find a way to compliment their competitive fire tonight
pos,Pos,lakers fans liked that
pos,Pos,all the lakers fans that came into the game thread posting salty bullshit at the suns no one cares that you re being a salty bitch for the last 24 hours neither portland nor phoenix likes the lakers get outta here so many of them said something about being humble which is hilarious coming from lakers fans edit being a salty bitch is not the same thing as trolling if you were in the game thread you would have seen they were not trolls
neg,Neg,imagine if the 200 mil man memes if ayton had gotten the extension
pos,Pos,can anyone who watched the game tell me why cp only had 5 shot attempts just kind of a weird stat line across the board did the blazers play lockdown d or something
pos,Neg,only 3 games in but boy ayton hasn t done anything to show he was worthy of a max based on his production this season
pos,Pos,lakers fucking suck to lose to this team awful start of the season garbage offense destroyed twice this is not the same team as last season
neg,Pos,league really had us play a b2b traveling to portland from la
pos,Neg,oh no we suck again
neg,Neg,lmaooooo suns
pos,Pos,inconsistent thy name is the phoenix suns they re positively mercurial
pos,Pos,ayton should get over it and beast mode now
pos,Pos,shocking given the way they played against the lakers
pos,Pos,honestly guys the blazers need to make a trade for a number 2 player for cj to be with he doesn t have enough help
pos,Pos,portland loses at home to sacramento phoenix beats the lakers on the road therefore it is automatic that portland blows out phoenix tonight
pos,Pos,and to think everyone was wanting cj traded for draft stock this last off season
pos,Pos,is ayton pouting
pos,Pos,if mccollum can help dame score every game and be consistemt this team is scary
pos,Pos,all those annoying and presumptuous suns fans nowhere to found now smh
pos,Pos,damn suns fans way quiet in the gt tonight after saying lakers fans were quiet last night how the turn tables
pos,Pos,how you gonna give ayton 6 shots when he is being defended by nurkic it seems the suns just pray devin booker scores 30 sometimes to win
pos,Pos,cp3 is overpaid
pos,Pos,max ayton
pos,Pos,0 2 clippers activated
pos,Pos,that was quite the exciting final minute grizz matched pg shot for shot down the stretch good game
pos,Pos,man this memphis team has a real chance to win any game they re in they have the talent don t even feel bad about the l gg griz fans
neg,Pos,good game hate we lost but bane and jjj absolutely torched us from outside with timely shots again and again we got a bit too iso happy in the third and let the grizzlies build the lead also i know lue wants to keep morris in so he can get hot but batum is just so much better in so many different facets of the game you can just see it this game alone
neg,Neg,guess i love adams now if only grind and grind era me could see me now lots of explaining to do
pos,Neg,grizzlies shouldn t have this many young guys playing this well it unnatural
pos,Neg,pg and bledsoe came to ball today shame the supporting cast couldn t execute shoutout ihart for giving us life gg memphis ja is a beast
pos,Pos,grizzlies normally can rely on their bench but won today with just 13 bench points these starters play really well together but when dillon comes back and the bench gets a boost from either bane or dmelt we should be an incredibly well rounded team so excited for this season
pos,Pos,just not enough support around pg overall and we missed some crucial shots adams looks really good for the grizz it kinda seems like a great system for him to chip in and do what he does well
pos,Pos,big difference here was we hit our open threes and the clippers really didn t morris hits open shots we might have lost jaren misses some late threes we might have lost but neither of those happened so it worked out also adams looking great so far really does all the little things jv did but without the need for nearly as many touches only posted up when the clippers went small his screens are top tier rolls really hard rebounding is solid works nicely since we get all the things we need in a c but can give more shots to our guards who balled out tonight also shout out bane that last shot he hit was unreal last note pg13 is a monster every time he shot a 3 i thought it was going in
neg,Pos,obviously the story of the game was ja and jaren but wanna highlight adams and melton adams is perfect for this team good enough on defense gets lots of rebounds has decent touch with passes and clears the lane for an easy layup for ja about 2 3 times a game already and melton is so underrated and his shot is legit now he s only 23 was already great on defense and getting better every year on offense and on a very favorable contract for the next 3 seasons love this team and it s future
pos,Pos,hey look we are down 0 2 again
neg,Pos,great game grizz jaren with a clutch 3 21 7 rebs and solid d ja with 28 8 asts and strong decision making and leadership bane and melton hitting big shots all game adams doing all the dirty work and fitting in with the memphis grind mentality great win and on to the lakers tomorrow
pos,Pos,damn protagonist p
pos,Pos,shoutout jaren for his work on the glass when he wasn t coming down with the ball he was tapping it to teammates plus he held his own at the 5 to close out the game the improvement is real
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,love you pg
pos,Pos,paul george averaged 13 points against us last year
pos,Pos,so getting my anxiety level up late in games is back on the menu huh
neg,Neg,pg mvp is definitely on the cards he s come out firing to start the season good game grizzlies y all played well
neg,Pos,pg single handedly kept them in the game
pos,Pos,that dagger by jjj sheeeeeesh grizzlies still one of the most fun teams in the league to watch for the third season in a row
pos,Pos,okay who the fuck is bane
neg,Pos,i don t think ja was even trying that hard tonight just wait till we get out of the party zone
pos,Pos,jesus pg is on some shit
pos,Pos,this team is mad good adams is fitting into the team very nicely also pg is a monster kept the clips in this throughout the game
neg,Neg,always a pleasure to watch ja morant play
pos,Neg,i started watching with 2 minutes left in the 4th did not regret it
pos,Pos,lakers right now meep
pos,Pos,that bane shot though
pos,Neg,so many big plays by young players down the stretch you love to see it bane is gonna be a monster
neg,Neg,ja morant is really good
pos,Pos,lol at them playing float on after the game
pos,Pos,oh man these youngins are good
pos,Pos,yes
pos,Pos,pg is tuff asl bro
neg,Neg,morris minutes should be going to batum
pos,Pos,these two games are starting to make me change my mind about about paul george being massively overrated
pos,Pos,grizzlies have three players score 20 again i still contend our best line up will be ja bane melton brooks jjj can t wait to see that when brooks is healthy
pos,Neg,pg can t win with these cats
pos,Pos,morris sold
pos,Pos,damn the grizz almost had five guys at 20 points that s a solid team
pos,Neg,morris lost us that one when he missed that 3 same as a couple days ago memphis starters went crazy
neg,Neg,just like that neither la team has won a game since june
pos,Pos,the whole game was grizzlies getting a lead and clippers clawing it back goooood fucking game
pos,Pos,pg is still the best shooting guard in the league
pos,Pos,get pg some help
pos,Pos,doing my best stephen a this brother is special expression
neg,Pos,oh hell yeah
pos,Pos,good start for la teams but no one does best in team chemistry than lakers
pos,Pos,battle of la gonna be in the play in tourney this year
pos,Pos,this was my first time watching ja play very very interesting to observe he seems unlike any other star player i ve seen as someone who s only been into the nba for 4 years i think it s because he looks so small to me compared to everyone else on the court i wonder if he needs to bulk up a little bit if he wants to elevate his game to true super star levels super fun team to watch look forward to matching up with them later in the season though i feel like it s gonna be a stressful game hah
neg,Pos,clippers and lakers both losing you love to see it
pos,Pos,thunder gonna have two top 5 picks at this rate
pos,Pos,i m surprised they kept putting the ball in bledsoe s hands towards the end instead of reggie jackson
pos,Pos,will the lakers or clippers win their first game first
neg,Pos,0 2 clippers all according to keikaku
pos,Pos,extremely balanced attack from the grizzlies
pos,Pos,only mildly upset that we didn t pick bane in the draft s
pos,Pos,man when did bledsoe get sent to the clippers i don t remember that happening at all
pos,Pos,honestly would love to see both la teams go 2 80
pos,Pos,if pg took over earlier dont play with ur food specially with a grizz squad that came to play
pos,Pos,starting to feel less confident about the warriors two wins lol
neg,Neg,make morant make a play no idea why they kept forcing the ball out his hands
pos,Pos,holy shit chandler went off
neg,Pos,clipps will be forced to play kawhi cant load manage him like last seasons
pos,Pos,bricksoe
pos,Pos,lamelo playing zero minutes in the 4th quarter despite a great game is a testament to how well ish smith and cody martin played tonight that sequence cody martin had where he generated 2 charges and hit all his shots pretty much ended the game too miles bridges scoring 32 after dropping 30 last game sheesh we got a good one
pos,Neg,i cannot believe in a game featuring kd and james harden ish smith and cody martin took over down the stretch
pos,Pos,the nets really just lost a game because of ish smith and cody martin
pos,Pos,cody martin and ish smith carrying the hornets to victory over the nets just as everyone predicted
pos,Pos,welcome to the ish smith 4th quarter show
pos,Pos,the east is gonna be a bloodbath this year
pos,Pos,miles gonna earn himself a max contract 2018 class wildin luka trae ayton shai jjj mpj mikal and miles bridges sexton also plenty of really good role players like donte huerter rob williams brunson gary trent shamet graham bruce brown also some guys that had trouble with injuries like bagley bamba wendell who can still get better and some guys like grayson allen and lonnie that can still improve and become very good role players
neg,Pos,i stopped watching this game when it was tied with 2 mins to go in the 3rd wtf happened
neg,Pos,who would have thought that ish smith trading buckets with durant the other way was a winning gameplan
pos,Neg,is this what it feels like to be a fan of a solid team feels nice
pos,Neg,i really hope nets fans never forget when cody martin hit an iso stepback 3 on kd to ice the game or when he drew two consecutive charges to get harden out of the game our two leading scorers in this game didn t even touch the floor in the 4th quarter lmao
pos,Pos,hum diddly dee
pos,Pos,kd can t win with these cats
neg,Pos,you know its over when ish smith knocks down multiple contested 3s
pos,Pos,everyone besides kd played terribly can t even imagine how frustrating it is for him
neg,Pos,3 0 alongside the chicago bulls think about that mj bringing the hornets to the conference finals against his old team
neg,Neg,kd is just unreal from mid range
pos,Neg,i got downvoted for telling people they need to remember how even last year the nets had to play their big 3 like 40 minutes a game to guarantee some of the wins they absolutely can bury you especially if the entire team is rolling but if they only have two of the three and one of them has an off night they re incredibly beatable if the hornets can beat them by 10 shooting 30 from 3 when durant goes off shooting great then yeah they re very much beatable with just 2 of the big 3 durant is scary but honestly the bucks did not play very consistent or well that series last year
pos,Pos,did not see ish smith going super saiyan in the 4th quarter coming
pos,Pos,17 24 fgm a god damn kd
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,we undefeated
pos,Neg,kd can t win with those cats
neg,Pos,kelly oubre is on the hornets
pos,Pos,the nets would be 0 3 right now if doc rivers would ve challenged the other day
pos,Pos,so many brave nets protestors died for this for what
pos,Pos,miles bridges is the player toronto fans think og is
pos,Pos,undefeated
pos,Pos,oh boy i can t wait for our hot start to be completely ignored and the narrative be about the nets losing and kyrie not playing
pos,Neg,lmao we really gave lamelo the steph curry 4th quarter treatment against the nets
neg,Pos,i m ready for the hornets to be good such a fun team
neg,Neg,just give hornets the chip already
pos,Pos,horny
pos,Pos,cody martin and ish smith james harden
neg,Neg,ish smith is a point guard
pos,Pos,well apparently i was completely wrong about the hornets
pos,Neg,give cody martin the bag
neg,Pos,i can t believe we lost to this kevin durant scrub
pos,Pos,if it s not for a sixers choke the nets are 0 3
pos,Pos,if kevin durant s goal for coming to brooklyn was to win a championship irving is no longer an asset in that endeavor
pos,Neg,lamelo didn t even play in the 4th ish and cody took over down the stretch
pos,Pos,james harden out of shape
pos,Neg,its realy starting to feel like this is the year when the old blood rolls over to the new
pos,Neg,harden was like the 5th or 6th best player on the court tonight
pos,Pos,harden is the best player on the nets r nba
pos,Pos,nets need another superstar
pos,Pos,i m here to overreact
pos,Pos,is bouknight not in the rotation even with rozier injured
pos,Neg,feels like ish smith been on every single team in his career
pos,Pos,props to the guy with this hot take in the game discussion thread this morning
pos,Pos,ish smith is better than mj
neg,Neg,r nba gonna be in shambles if lakers win tonight
pos,Neg,james harden not looking great and no it s not because of the rule changes like nba makes it out to be most likely the system
pos,Pos,ish smith and cody martin kd and harden
neg,Pos,its amazing to see harden cry for every foul he is not getting anymore lol
neg,Pos,dooklyn shits blown the fuck out
neg,Neg,this past summer we would have had a field day with that my next chapter meme
neg,Pos,cody martin ballin very unexpected but i m here for it
pos,Pos,kd in mvp szn mode
neg,Pos,harden snot caught on cam
neg,Neg,have not watched the game but seeing the nets with only 12 ft is wild
pos,Pos,unbelievable
pos,Pos,we miss ya ish our turn next
pos,Pos,my guy
neg,Pos,nets need kyrie back
pos,Pos,just wait until they release bouknight
pos,Pos,in other news the demise of jayson tatum and jalen green was greatly overstated
pos,Pos,every rookie might have their season high against the celtics this year
pos,Pos,forsaken grant williams awakened klaymond green
pos,Pos,for jalen green to get 30 without free throws is insane and awesome and sengun is just pure heart
pos,Pos,don t let sengun s fg and 5 fouls deceive you guy had a hell of a game for a rookie center
pos,Pos,obvious rookie stand out aside sengun is very interesting the celtics still lack ball movement it s super basic offensive actions like drive and kick if that horford looks spry so it s a relief to see him still be extremely dominant on defense
pos,Pos,good to see c s get it together after a shaky start looking forward to nesmith s nerves settling props to grant williams for keeping us on track
pos,Pos,yes jalen green but i just wanna say alperen sengun is gonna be an insane player
neg,Neg,celtics like letting rookies get buckets such good hospitality
neg,Pos,jalen green
neg,Neg,grant williams haters
neg,Pos,turnovers and bad defense are pretty common problems for young teams if this team was serious about competing this season i would be stressing the need for a more passing pg and i ll admit that i m not as high on kpj compared to other rockets fans and better wing defense as tatum just did whatever he wanted still it was a good loss
pos,Neg,rockets y all got a real good one jalen green is a baller sengun looked good too
neg,Pos,can t wait to watch jalen and sengun on tuesday going to be sitting right behind the rockets bench hoping for another 30 piece from jalen and a double double from sengun
pos,Pos,yeah but did you see our rookies tho
pos,Pos,if brown would have played this game would have featured a jayson a jae sean a jaylen and a jalen
pos,Pos,where were you when jalen green saved basketball and the world
pos,Pos,i really had a whole essay written out at doomers when we were only up 2 at half a product of 50 vs 30 3pt shooting and green being unguardable but then we ran away with it and i could be happy
pos,Pos,jalen green is a vision this rockets team is really fun to watch
neg,Pos,on the board baby
pos,Pos,jalen goat
neg,Pos,jalen green
neg,Neg,let s nba
pos,Pos,the amount of highlights posted would have you believe the rockets were winning not that i mind some of that jalen green stuff was niiiiiice
pos,Pos,is it time to start worrying about jalen green
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,you d think with all the jalen green hype post that houston would have won
neg,Neg,jg is awesome in the biblical sense
pos,Neg,knicks needs to hold a team meeting for losing to the magic
pos,Pos,cole anthony was on fire tonight holy shit lol
pos,Pos,alright now that was some embarrassing shit
neg,Neg,damn imagine losing to the magic who are down 4 starters
pos,Neg,better than the lakers confirmed
pos,Pos,to all of the bitch ass knicks fans in orlando papa johns code magicwin you re very welcome
neg,Pos,stands got so empty at the end i thought it was a home game
pos,Pos,j cole anthony is so fuckin good pretend like ny is your matchup every time
pos,Pos,revenge baby cole world glad i can stop sweating lol ggs knicks
neg,Neg,magic fans remind me of us with being petty and self deprecating i love it respect
neg,Neg,gotta to give the magic credit they wanted revenge for friday and they got it we were way too lackadaisical they were the far better team tonight on to the sixers
pos,Pos,knicks are pretty good but unfortunately they ran into the best team in the league
neg,Neg,someone link in the moe wagner poster i want it hanging outside of amway asap
pos,Pos,the magic are probably the 29th best team in the nba when healthy and they are missing 3 starters tonight oof
pos,Pos,good shit showing us up orlando magic def have got some promising potential talent said this in the last thread but they don t quit and that says a lot about the young guys and mosley i ll def be watching this team and mosley s career with interest still very disappointing performance from us and can t help but feel we kind of gave this away have no idea why we were so committed to dying by the 3 when we should have been focusing on exploiting orlando s relative inexperience and picking up and ones off the drive like we started to do in the last minute
pos,Pos,cole set the example for intensity and effort tonight glad to see my man have a big game nice to see the torch getting lit to close it out too
neg,Pos,wagner brothers run nyc
pos,Neg,dont forget that this was the youngest starting lineup in nba history since they started recording the ages and they beat an nba team filled with a good mix of vets and young players in their prime years and wanting to win this was a magic team beating a team that needs to win soon and the magic that is rebuilding won that through out hustling and just out fighting for the win that is a winning mentality they did great cole suggs rj are the type of players who fight till the end and were great pickups to lead this developing team fultz to me will join in easily as he is also gritty and is clutch in final 5 mins
pos,Pos,everyone but d rose walks home tonight
pos,Pos,the best part about being a lottery team full of young raw but ultimately talented players is games like this cole is my new dad
neg,Neg,can we stop all the are the orlando magic the worst team in nba history 1 posts now
pos,Pos,bing bong you just lost to greg anthonys son and the sheck wes song
pos,Pos,getting cooked by cole anthony and t ross now thats some shit
pos,Pos,bing bong bing bong bing bong you lost to cole motherfucking anthony bitches
pos,Pos,barrett got clamped all game by wagner
pos,Pos,is kemba on a minute restriction i dont get why thibs didnt try playing kemba and rose together when the knicks couldnt score at all
neg,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,julius randle you are not melo move the ball
neg,Neg,randle went 8 24 for kobe
pos,Neg,terrence ross almost outscored the knicks in the 4th yeesh
pos,Pos,franz wagner is looking nice out there
pos,Pos,terrence ross has to be one of the weirdest scorers of all time
pos,Pos,people are really sleeping on the magic this team has one of the most underrated backcourts in the league i predict that the magic will shock the nba by torching the east with a win total of 32 and comfortably in 12th place
pos,Pos,wendell carter is a steal
neg,Pos,terrence ross fuck you the game right after we hit a team record of 24 3ptm turns out to be the one where the jumpshot betrays us completely it already seemed over though when d rose missed a ft after the foul in the final minute being an 88 3 ft shooter in this day and age it s incredibly difficult to win back to back games even against teams that aren t expected to be in the playoffs or that you beat soundly next week will be very brutal for us against the 76ers on tuesday and the bulls on thursday hopefully this bitter loss doesn t trickle down on the upcoming games
pos,Neg,the knicks really let cole get 16 rebounds yikes
pos,Pos,great this magics team has a pretty balanced offense looking forward to getting blown out by the magic tomorrow it s ok knicks magic can be really powerful when they want to be you were just a snack for them though we are going to be their main course tomorrow
neg,Neg,bing bong
pos,Pos,moe wagner lobi ltoppin
pos,Pos,bing bong the knicks are dead
pos,Pos,any other knicks fans get ptsd to that game against toronto last year where we hit like 3 threes for the entire game
pos,Pos,97 1 still on the menu boys
pos,Pos,franz wagner is really good
pos,Pos,shoutout to all the knick fans that were salty that bulls fans were excited about us going 3 0 for beating bad teams bing bong
pos,Neg,free throws quickley can stay on the bench if that s how he s going to contribute we need nerlens back badly taj is just not a good enough sub for mitch when dealing with quicker players shot like a shitstorm a loss we deserved everyone is entitled to a coupla yuckers a season
neg,Pos,d rose the only knick who shot the 3 well tonight
pos,Pos,franz wagner exposed julius randle
pos,Pos,mo bamba litchell lobinson
pos,Pos,playoff randle showed up
pos,Pos,fuck
pos,Pos,shit well that was a game
pos,Pos,cathartic
neg,Pos,cole anthony with 16 rebounds wtf
pos,Pos,east is looking like a bloodbath this year it ll be great
neg,Pos,bingbong otown wins 80 2 baby
pos,Pos,mo bamba finally got them hoes now
pos,Pos,this is funny shit
pos,Neg,what s the story behind the bing bong with the knicks
pos,Pos,knicks got ice cold in the fourth stopped making threes except rose if not for that knicks win this one
pos,Pos,terrence ross has the sexiest jump shot in the league
neg,Neg,i didn t watch the game are the numbers telling the whole story that rose tried to drag the knicks out of their shit and failed
pos,Pos,after reading the comments i have to check the magic sub
pos,Pos,8 of 24 kobe lives in this man
neg,Pos,best cole to play basketball anthony cole norris cole aldrich cole j cole other
pos,Pos,imagine not being 3 0
neg,Neg,lmaooo
pos,Pos,rj yikes barrett has been hot garbage to start the season and he was taking so many threes in the clutch plus he was getting cooked on defense too next year contract extension up knicks fans will hate him if he keeps this shit up lmao
neg,Neg,the patriots and magic won tonight son i can t complain as a fan cole was awesome and suggs hustle and defense was really good franz is unathletic but he makes winning plays ross was on fire but dammit if i do not like the bench bugs isaac and chuma can t come back fast enough also we need mcw just so we have someone who can organize our defense when it slips
neg,Pos,knicks spent the no 3 pick on a worse andre roberson
neg,Pos,how do y all feel about suggs i like his game but i have mixed feelings about his start to the season
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,give cole anthony the supermax you cowards
pos,Pos,prime julius randle game lmao
pos,Pos,is that chris brickley music
pos,Pos,no shame in losing to magic legend cole buckets anthony
pos,Pos,what happened to quickley fell off the grid late last season
pos,Neg,am i seeing this correctly wendell carter franz and bamba starting jumbo lineups are back on the menu yall
pos,Pos,hate losing when there s been dirty plays all well on to the next
pos,Pos,thanks knicks for ruining my parlay lol
pos,Pos,moral victory number 1
pos,Pos,hey we look like a functional nba team
neg,Pos,furkan doesn t play enough minutes
pos,Neg,definitely the best game we ve played this season so far far less errant passes and sloppy plays like in the first two games
neg,Neg,we lost but at least i had fun watching all i ask for
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,it s so annoying how good seth curry is
neg,Pos,can the okc commentators stop calling players by their initials
pos,Pos,josh giddey
neg,Pos,no 76rs lead ever feels safe
pos,Pos,sga is nice but good win team
pos,Neg,curry curry
pos,Pos,for most of the game philly announsers were very good i was enjoiyng them but the commentary on emdiid s foul on giddey was surprising to me couldn t care less about giddey as long as joel is ok fuck you dude good game from our boys btw much better then first two
pos,Pos,curry looking like curry tonight
pos,Pos,good game by jojo but why try to block that jesus
pos,Neg,that was an extremely fun game i don t even care that we lost shai had a rough first 2 games but dominated tonight he was much more aggressive and getting to the rim at will he was scorching thybulle a top defender in the league really nice to see him play well giddey was just incredible man he s so so good at only 19 amazing passer with a deadly floater good that he finally had a bigger role today dort in the 4th quarter was a man possessed incredible defense and energy plays i really liked our offense more today more ball movement super super fun game give me more of this
pos,Pos,how the fuck did timothee chalamet drop dune and proceed to drop 19 8 6 in great efficiency happy to see jo dap him up after that block attempt the players were cool about it somehow neckbeards here are losing their shit
neg,Pos,what s up with embiid
pos,Pos,if only ralph macchio had a big man that wasn t a washed up favors or mike muscala to put out okc might win a game this year
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,in for a long decade
pos,Pos,i will say i wasn t that high on giddey when he was drafted but he impressed in this game i look forward to watching him play again
pos,Pos,i like how the losing team had more highlights than the winning team
pos,Pos,it would be really unfortunate if embiid misses the next couple games just because of that play
neg,Neg,that s what the sixers need
pos,Pos,ez clap
pos,Pos,lol damn the sixers must really suck to only beat the fucking thunder by 12 that s like losing by 30 to a normal team
pos,Pos,watching us not turn the ball over every other possession is a great feeling
neg,Neg,the warriors record in games where draymond scores 10 is absolutely ridiculous
pos,Pos,tristan thompson will never outrebound steph again in their matchups lol holmes is still underrated for what he can bring d mitch better than what i thought
pos,Pos,the kings being behind in the fourth quarter always leads to very frustrating basketball as they seem to rush everything without thinking at that point leading to both bad offense and bad defense i think richaun holmes is going to punch a ref one of these games
pos,Pos,andrew around 18ppg no matter what wiggins
pos,Neg,gp2 avery bradley no offense to ab but gpii fits our system more
neg,Neg,jordan poole put me through a roller coaster of emotions tonight lol he s getting better though i m excited to see his improvement by mid season when klay comes back
pos,Pos,so warriors are a top 4 team in the west without klay impressive
pos,Pos,super impressed with gp2 lights out defense
pos,Pos,is it me or steph s defense this game is so fvckin good
pos,Pos,gary payton ii was huge in this game so many defensive plays our bench looks solid this year too
neg,Pos,michael jordan poole party is backkk
pos,Pos,wwwarriors are we in 2015
neg,Neg,the game is a lot closer than the score indicates gg kings
pos,Pos,where were you when stephen curry became a nightly triple double watch regular
neg,Neg,sir davion got my respek what a baller
pos,Neg,jordan poole has been looking really nice this year
neg,Pos,gp2 is a pest on defense great pickup
pos,Pos,this was fun as hell
pos,Pos,we shot badly this game but compensated it with minimal turnovers as much as i like steph to explode i still prefer a team effort win
pos,Pos,davion first step is crazy
pos,Pos,gsw now the first seed in the west feels like old times
pos,Pos,4q poole gp2 wiggins opj jta is now my new favourite warriors lineup lol little sloppy but those guys are hustle personified jta is looking more and more like mini dray by each game dude didnt have a great offensive game but was directing traffic all throughout the start of 4th and getting the hustle plays
pos,Pos,random thoughts steph was off tonight and the warriors still grinded out a win good sign for the warriors scary sign for the rest of the west warriors kind sleptwalked through this game kings played with significantly higher intensity said effort would lead to a win most nights poole had a nice bounceback game after a rough start to the season opj is such a luxury for the warriors to have and the mvp of this game imio dude can play anywhere from the 3 5 and his defense is underrated if hes healthy warriors will be very tough to beat davion needs to be in the kings closing lineup his defense is too valuable to sit on the bench rishaun holmes is mad underrated dude is such a solid c kings are lucky to have him wtf happened to hali dude looks lost out there rn been said before but fire walton ffs kings with a real head coach would be a serious play in contender with upside as it stands they lack a real offensive system outside of shoot 3 s pnr and fox iso s same applies to defense buddy hield has no conscience sometimes thats good sometimes thats bad tonight it was bad i wanna see the kings try some super small ball fox haliburton hield mitchell harkless hb just try and gas teams out running up and down
pos,Pos,congrats to the 69th best assist man
pos,Pos,god damn this warriors with no curry team is looking legit the ball movement shooting and ability to score off the dribble by the 2nd unit really showed out there in the 4th and broke out the close game and fuck me was steph s defense great in this game warriors may have a legit shot at being a top 3 western team
pos,Pos,for the last 2 3 years we ve done an amazing job of falling apart in the last few minutes against the warriors okay that s every team but especially the warriors
pos,Pos,had them on the laptop god at least i have the dubs to clean my palate of whatever the fuck the niners did on snf
pos,Pos,it was nice to see harrison barnes play like it was game 7 of the finals
pos,Pos,wwwarriors this warriors team is deep poole and bjelica are playmakers they can create their own shots and will find open players for good shot opportunities and then guys like jta and damion lee and porter are not afraid to take shots as the game presents it to them wouldn t surprise me if their finish as a 3 seed or better
pos,Pos,i can t tell you which is more surprising wiggins getting the highest or draymond shooting 50 across the board
neg,Neg,strength in numbers 6 players in double figures again jeez and jta at center agn are we back to last season heh
pos,Pos,it s happening again isn t it
pos,Pos,impressed with gsw defensive efforts gp2 was helluva intense whole game steph played good but not great and still 27 7 10
pos,Pos,this warriors team is legit and they re not even at full strength can t wait to see how they do as the season goes on
pos,Neg,to think last season it took the warriors till damn near mid season to string together 3 straight wins and here they are 3 0 feels like the team can only go up from here with klay wiseman and potentially kuminga all rejoining the rotation eventually
pos,Pos,the warriors are back this team is deep af and currys game is ageless only the jazz suns and maybe the nuggets going to give them trouble the front office is elite they didn t give in to the hype and overpay for simmons or other marquee free agents and instead signed a bunch of high quality rotation players
pos,Pos,www
pos,Pos,curry mvp this season
pos,Neg,everyone on the kings sub is turning on fox rn this season definitely gon be a shitshow
pos,Pos,that gsw 4q lineup of jta mix is really fun just pure long arms pestering stinks on offense but throws out shooters out of their game
pos,Neg,74 8 season incoming
pos,Pos,poole party
neg,Neg,gary payton ii played great on both sides of the court defense was special man should get paid if he keeps this consistent
pos,Neg,kings are actually looking scary this season like not necessarily deep playoffs run scary but gonna fuck up good teams when you least expect it scary for sure and i won t be shocked to see them in the playoffs
pos,Pos,it s nice for the warriors to have a good bench can t wait for klay to come back this was a fun game overall
pos,Neg,league ain t ready for gp2 with a jumper too nice
neg,Pos,good minutes from payton ii
pos,Pos,draymond with the draymond wiggins with the wiggins curry with the lebron gary payton ii with the gary payton i interesting how much of a back seat bjelica took tonight once kerr figured out the problem was staying in front of fox mitchell barnes nice to see barnes doing well by the by i swear i thought poole had a terrible game from all the hero shots he threw away but i guess he was making them while i wasn t looking
neg,Neg,kings need a leader bad fox need to step up
neg,Neg,the kings really might be a playoff team this year their three headed guard thing reminds me of those dragic bledsoe it suns and with good talented frontcourt guys like holmes and barnes they re running legitimately talented lineups
pos,Pos,warriors are closing out games much much better now it s been something we ve struggled with quite a bit last year
neg,Pos,we say this every year but the kings have some great young talent fox haliburton and mitchell all seem to be on the right track holmes is a decent big those push shots are automatic hb overall is pretty solid hield is an elite shooter but isn t very good at anything else they seem close to being a playoff team just need some more depth and some veteran players to bring it all together
pos,Pos,lakers clippers now kings warriors own california
pos,Pos,davion mitchell is going to be a problem and i never understood why he dropped to 9th he looked this damn good at baylor
pos,Pos,are we spooky
pos,Neg,this is the problem i ve had with barnes his entire career he s never assertive whether he s on fire or not they had buddy just launching up garbage 3 after 3 in the 4th i think hb touched the ball once in the 4th quarter at some point you gotta be like give me the fucking ball
neg,Neg,these kings are young and fun and it makes me happy i will be watching and rooting all year
neg,Pos,yet again for the umpteenth year in a row it s not the losses it s how we lose a team made out of cardboard that can t finish a game strong ever we have a coach who doesn t understand player strengths and weaknesses insisting on buddy being a ball handler jesus man speaking of buddy he s not an nba player period he can shoot the lights out when no one guards him he should be wearing a jump suit on the sideline in his new role as shooting coach he can t play basketball he can only shoot basketballs and wtf are we even doing with bagley dnp cd game 1 plays some minutes game 2 dnp cd game 3 i get that he s trash but what are we even doing but at least he can t turn the ball over in crunch time when he s on the bench unlike buddy took 3 games for us to say same ol kings 16 years out of the playoffs in a league where half the teams make the playoffs can we get a banner in the rafters for that
neg,Neg,every warriors game gonna be close this year
pos,Neg,we look like ass man 4th quarter collapse
neg,Neg,golden bench warrios baybeeh
pos,Pos,a winning warriors team makes the west much more exciting can t wait to see more of this plus steph dominating
pos,Pos,how
neg,Pos,what is a catch
neg,Neg,status update luke walton still has a job
pos,Pos,andrew wiggins with another 17
pos,Pos,kings have some nice players fox mitchel holmes and haliburton are fun to watch i don t think the dubs will lose many games when dray puts up 14 points love the new bench curry s got some help this year
pos,Pos,8 ql p z9zx
pos,Pos,golden state kings
pos,Pos,hot take luke might not be great but he still isn t your biggest issue geographically no one wants to be in sac and your roster construction pays for it you have some great pieces but coaching is not the only reason you lack cohesion gg though kings with real defense is fun to watch and i think the second half of the season will be satisfying
pos,Pos,looks like the warriors bandwagon train never left
pos,Neg,the kings should just disband and try something else hockey maybe
neg,Pos,damn davion has steph shooting horrendously from 3 but then again it s the kings so he still dropped 27 lol
pos,Neg,fox is so frustrating to watch right now he either drives through three players and lays it in at top breakneck speed or he drives into three players and turns the ball over horribly needs a real coach to help maximise his abilities walton is wasting him
neg,Pos,warriors played excellent defense specially on fox man is so fast he should called flash
pos,Neg,warriors bulls finals
pos,Pos,warrios been playing good they just need klay back
pos,Pos,at least now you know why the warriors won 73 games in a regular season he wears 40
pos,Pos,warriors look really good so far klay coming back is going to make them even scarier
neg,Neg,davion mitchell playing more minutes than haliburton and buddy hield only getting 25 mins shooting 2 10 bodes well for the hypothetical ben simmons trade
pos,Neg,my god these refs
neg,Pos,i am still mad that gsw did not trade wiseman no 7 pick and extra picks to get a star back i would be fine with anybody who can play in a play off game curry is still in his prime and they waste time with players who won t see the court in a play off game these guys deserved better and as soon as curry with draymond and klay hangs it up gsw will be right there with the worst teams in the nba
pos,Pos,i guess off night is the one who had an off night tonight i say this because he didn t completely shut down steph i know with steph it s more team defends because of screens etc no need to write me a fucking russian novel he did score 22 points so that s good
neg,Neg,i am dying they held up the end of the game because one ref made the signal it s over and then marc davis rushed over to him and said only i can say the game is over you can t do that amateur hourrrrrrrr
neg,Neg,10000000 iq by the commentators jinxing morant by saying he was making all three free throws
neg,Neg,ja morant is a bad motherfucker deandre jordan is bad
neg,Pos,i managed to squeeze in the lord of the rings trilogy in the last 5 mins of this game
neg,Neg,reaves with the caruso stat line lmao 4p 3a 18 in 18 mins
neg,Neg,the end of this game took 30 minutes to play out 20 seconds left 4 timeouts were used and we witnessed 5 sets of free throws jesus christ that was awful to watch
pos,Pos,kent bazemore you lucky bastard
pos,Pos,you knew ja was gonna miss the 3rd ft when the announcer already counted it as a make lol
pos,Pos,melo s undead ass kept on doing this to us should have offered him a deal this off season to just fuck off already
pos,Neg,tough miss by morant at the end but shoutout to melo for the carry
pos,Pos,that game ended like 3 times lol
neg,Pos,ja is so fucking good wtf
neg,Pos,kent bozomore
pos,Pos,morant did not take kindly to all the people saying he was overrated this past offseason and honestly good on him all those people clearly weren t watching grizzlies games morant is friggin amazing he just didn t have proper help last season because jjj was out basically all year and winslow was garbage
pos,Pos,ja slander allowed
pos,Pos,bazemore you fucking doughnut
pos,Pos,ugly win but at least the drummond curse is broken now
neg,Neg,imagine saying that ja s 40 point outrageously good performance was wasted because he missed that last free throw the grizz aren t in the game without him phenomenal
pos,Neg,13 free throws two long challenges and multiple timeouts in the last minute of game time fouling up three is obviously the sound strategy but damn if it doesn t make the game boring as hell to watch
pos,Pos,ugly w for the lakers but def an improvement from last game for them boring end to a fun game end of games really need to stop taking forever
pos,Pos,how many reviews and timeout breaks do we need the final 2 minutes of this game took what felt like an hour of real time it is quite ridiculous and takes away from the game
neg,Pos,ja morant is reminding me so much of ai
pos,Neg,take a bow ja 40 point double double ain t no joke especially against these veterans sure lakers are figuring out stuff but ja played his heart out there
pos,Pos,7 seconds took 70 minutes i swear
pos,Neg,melo with the hard carry just what we brought him for
pos,Neg,lol why d we get the ball in the end there if it was out on wb oh well win s a win
pos,Pos,melo carrying these scrubs
pos,Pos,why was the ball out of bounds for the lakers there
pos,Pos,olympic melo out tonight
pos,Pos,bazemore is so lucky lmao
pos,Pos,how toxic was that live thread towards the end
neg,Neg,it s just good to get the w and build momentum even if it s not a pretty process ja is fucking legit though
pos,Neg,bazemore was a ja morant ft away from death threats lol
pos,Neg,imagine not staying e7mo poor souls
pos,Pos,this one hurts
pos,Pos,the last minute took longer than the previous 11 minutes
pos,Pos,ja proving once again why he is one of the most entertaining players to watch in the league today
neg,Pos,melo is an underrated pick up
pos,Pos,there goes ja s sleep tonight
pos,Pos,hell of a game from ja tonight we get cooked without him he s special
pos,Neg,what won the lakers this game was the bigs keeping jjj from being a factor in the game you can let morant drop 40 as long as the other guys don t pop off
pos,Pos,russ a mere 3 rebounds and 1 to away from adding to his all time quadruple double stat with melo moving up a spot in the all time point ranks this game it also saw ad move into the top 50 for blocks that is the only category of pt reb ast st bl to that lebron isn t in the top 50 as he is back at lebron is now 7 steals away from getting to the all time steals spot russ is 7 to away from the 8th spot then 14 more till 7th and i noticed that chris paul is going to be jumping from to on assists within the next few games
pos,Pos,lol the refs had to make it all about them until the very end
neg,Neg,hate that ending for ja god that s gotta be tough
neg,Pos,imagine having trouble with your starters so you just call carmelo anthony to shoot 75 from 3 and 67 in total to drop 28 insane
pos,Neg,the fucking weirdest game i ve ever witnessed were the refs in powertrip mode again
neg,Pos,grizzlies should be a playoff not play in lock at this rate
pos,Neg,the jjj 3 point foul by ad followed by a jjj rebounding foul on ad turned out to low key be the biggest difference of the game near the end imo
pos,Pos,damn i feel bad for ja dude always leaves his heart on the floor every game
pos,Pos,i m just happy for melo
pos,Pos,carmelo anthony
pos,Neg,itt people who watched who only watched the last 5 minutes
neg,Neg,how it felt in that game thread
pos,Pos,lakers needed that and overall they played well enough to win got lucky at the end though with ja s miss gotta get better memphis is looking pretty good
neg,Neg,ja morant is a big problem
pos,Pos,really despise our propensity to play like shit in the 2nd half 2 3 games now so far where we have really good first halves and follow it up with shit shows also despise anthony davis doing fucking nothing against weak interior opposition tonight was a good win but two things to note we re getting bullied inside both on the boards and point in the paint areas that were our strong suit the last two seasons we traded smaller more nimble players for athleticism and height and we re getting demolished no excuse for it
pos,Pos,memphis basketball teams and missed free throws in clutch time name a better duo
pos,Pos,fucking finally
pos,Pos,lol either we re a top four seed in the west once dillon brooks comes back or the lakers are barely a playoff team but no one wants to admit either of those could be true
neg,Neg,ja has played phenomenal tonight and the past 2 games so fucking impressive
pos,Pos,what a horrible ending
pos,Pos,this game was way longer than it should ve been
pos,Pos,and now we all unclinch
pos,Neg,bazemore bailed out on this one
pos,Pos,it sucks ja missed the third free throw but we fought to the end considering they destroyed us last year we made them sweat tonight gg wp we got 2 days to rest up and face blazers
pos,Pos,2nd half was so fucking hype
pos,Pos,i m glad for the win but jesus christ ja morant was incredible
neg,Pos,oh god why did i read the comments in the game thread those last minutes i think chernobyl on 26 april 1986 was less toxic than that
pos,Neg,bron s game is aging well dude s wet from deep
pos,Neg,melo saved the lakers season
pos,Neg,ja morant ballin
pos,Pos,don t sleep on austin reaves aka caruso 2 0 carmelo look nice
pos,Pos,i didn t watch the nba the last decade how is melo still doing this
pos,Pos,road to champions 80 2
pos,Pos,i don t even know what the fuck happened to end the game that s a problem for the whole nba
neg,Neg,what a game
pos,Neg,shitshow of an ending by the refs to say the least
pos,Pos,why tf did we have the last possession loool
pos,Pos,nice to watch a game without the touch fouls and with quick call reviews
pos,Pos,i m gonna enjoy the experience where i can seems like it won t be often this year
pos,Neg,so many fast breaks getting stopped in this game kinda nuts
pos,Pos,lakers traded all their defense for 3 point shooting
pos,Pos,and just like that we back
pos,Pos,the nba has got to do something about these endings 3 point game with 40 seconds to go should be the most exciting game possible not 10 minutes of fouls and timeouts
pos,Pos,those last 5 seconds were longer than the first 5 minutes lmao
neg,Pos,i think ja might be pretty solid
neg,Neg,this is the first lakers game i actually watched and what happened to the off season hype about ad playing the 5 this year to accommodate westbrook those lineups with westbrook and dj or dwight are gonna be fugly asf on offense all year
pos,Pos,that blown fast break pass to adams from ja really killed the grizzlies
pos,Pos,ja is a fucking monster man unreal
pos,Pos,no offense but herro really thought he s at ja s level
pos,Pos,at least steven is helping ja
pos,Pos,bruh morant
pos,Neg,melo proving why he s on the 75 list 75 from 3 66 from the floor and got 28 points from 15 shot attempts
neg,Neg,wow the more you look at the lakers boxscore the less you like their chances deandre jordan and kent bazemore starting austin reeves with 18 minutes and rondo with the dnp carmelo anthony the 6th man anxiously awaiting kendrick nunn s return from injury
neg,Neg,nba please create a rule where teams who are leading can t intentionally foul i hate how close games become a free throw contest
pos,Neg,awful refereeing in this league
neg,Pos,russ as the roll man makes a ton of difference for the team can still utilize his greatest strengths attacking and kicking out or passing to the cutting teammate like a mini draymond
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,so who should the lakers trade now weird how i found no westbrook highlights when the lakers win i guess the rule is to post them when he plays bad and the lakers lose
pos,Pos,anthony davis at the 5 is a two way beast
pos,Pos,definitely one of the weirder games i have ever seen
neg,Neg,those last 2 minutes lasted a quarter
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,final minute lasted more than 20 minutes
pos,Pos,wtf
pos,Pos,those last minutes were fucking intense and i was just following the score on google
neg,Pos,ja is such a special talent
neg,Neg,great game but what the fuck happened on the very last play what was the call and how is it side out lakers ball
neg,Neg,the last two minutes of this game started in 2016
pos,Pos,the look in his eyes when he was about to shoot the third free throw
neg,Neg,i love ja tough loss but team will just be getting better starters all had positive fought back hard on the second night of a back to back melo just obliterated our bench
neg,Neg,i went from graduating college to having grandson in that 7 seconds
pos,Pos,these refs wanted that overtime pay
pos,Pos,the story of the game all grizzlies starters are all grizzlies bench is
pos,Pos,that game left me scarred and deformed
pos,Pos,it s only the 3rd game you guys
neg,Neg,stayme7o
neg,Pos,ja is by far my favourite player to watch right now he makes it look so easy it s incredible to see
pos,Neg,so all is well until the next loss then every laker panic while we point and laugh and stay quiet when they win again
pos,Neg,stay m3lo
pos,Pos,are the lakers worse than expected or are the grizz better than expected find out next time on dragon ball z
neg,Pos,ja is crazy man hope it gets all star nod this year
pos,Pos,melo ja
neg,Pos,ja is my favorite point guard in the game fuck him for making it this close though lol
neg,Neg,lakers starters 45 lakers bench 70
neg,Neg,bazemore had a 2000 finals game 4 rick fox moment with that last minute foul
neg,Neg,morant hitting jordan esque shots all night
pos,Pos,these avery bradley box scores are reminding me of my intramural basketball career
pos,Pos,ad signature move is throwing his hands up and yelling at the refs on every possession
neg,Pos,yes
neg,Neg,hey yall need to keep hating on ja please he needs that chip on his shoulder
neg,Neg,ik isn t a perfect stat but still crazy to see the laker s starters all in the negative in a game they won
neg,Neg,i know ja is amazing but baze was getting roasted out there lakers really need their other guards to get healthy
neg,Neg,man melo has been hot from the 3 the first three games this season for the lakers 12 of 18 from 3
pos,Neg,not sure if anyone noticed but on the first of his last three free throws ja stepped into the paint before the ball hit the rim i don t think i ve seen that called more than once a year but would ve been crazy if they called it and it actually was the deciding factor
pos,Pos,ja is just too good i m so happy about reaves lebron has found his favorite goofy looking white player replacement lol
neg,Neg,lakers are finally clicking glimpses of good things to come ja s a monster can t wait for dillon to be back as well these grizzlies are a fun squad
pos,Pos,well even though we lost i m just glad it wasn t a blowout and we made it a close game for the lakers also fuck the refs for making that last like 5 minutes take longer than it needed to
neg,Pos,its carmelo saving lakers wtf
pos,Pos,that out of bounds davis steal flop over adams that got overturned was nuts adams didn t touch him and i watched it 5 times and can t figure out how he fell a man committed to his flop craft no wonder he gets hurt so much i mean he already had the steal i guess maybe he just fell you know you have real ref problems in the nba when a real fall meta flop results in foul call and confuses the hell outa everybody so bad it needs to be challenged and reviewed to make sure it wasn t a fake flop foul and just a normal fall jesus fking christ on a cracker
neg,Neg,lakers finally get that w 7th seed 1st round exit here we come
pos,Pos,laker fans we warned you about kent bazemore
pos,Pos,pretty awful win for the lakers hope this wasn t a fluke shooting night for morant
pos,Pos,there were stretches where the lakers played good d tonight and then for the other 46 minutes we were a complete sieve i m hoping beyond hope that most of it can be flattened out with coaching and repetition i think it s safe to say our defensive identity of the last two years is gone
neg,Pos,if you foul right away and you re up by more than 2 points it should be 3 shots
pos,Pos,it feels so good to win our first game of the season
pos,Pos,bazemore sucks
pos,Pos,intentional fouls to stop 3pa intentional fouls to stop 3pa intentional fouls to stop 3pa
pos,Pos,memphis is super top heavy their starters are damn good but the bench is booty and cant hold lead ja morant with a 3 point shot is a top 5 pg in the game wb is such a comically bad fit for the lakers rn if it werent for old man melo turning back the clock theyd be 0 3 glad to see reaves crack the rotation he deserves the minutes and fits in well with bron ad hope he gets an expanded role going forward dj is so fucking cooked lmao how is that man still stealing paychecks ah theres the patented baze boneheaded play lakers lucky af morant went 2 3
neg,Neg,this game wasn t fun to watch but i admire ja s hustle shoutout westbrook for both playinig hard and still fucking up at the same time was nice to see him doing offball screens but the turnovers in the first three quarters was yikes good performance from bron he was 4 9 and really tried his hardest to get ad and westbrook in rhythm and also stay melo
pos,Pos,talk about escaping with a win it really looked like morant had their number man s unstoppable this westbrook experiment is horrid 9 tos
neg,Pos,feels like an l tbh no disrespect to ja though he s gonna be an all star this year
pos,Pos,westbrook doesn t fit this team you can pencil him in for 5 turnovers a night i can t believe he had 9 tonight he s just not a good ball handler his shooting is also atrocious imagine getting paid 44m to air ball a wide open mid range shot melo is a certified shooter seems like bazemore was being scored on at will by all the grizz that last foul on ja was just stupid dj is also a defensive liability ja is going to be a star in this league
pos,Pos,damn they needed the carmelo pop off game to barely beat a memphis team on a b2b
pos,Neg,lakers fans in the game thread celebrating their 1st win of the season before the game is even finished
pos,Pos,what the fuck baby los angeles is fucking back
neg,Neg,holy fuckin shit melo
pos,Pos,lol westbrook with 9 turnovers and 33 3 fg
pos,Pos,carmelo anthony
pos,Neg,went from kuzma to bazemore
pos,Pos,melo lebron
pos,Pos,the lakers are not good right now
pos,Pos,refs really wanted lakers to lose there
pos,Pos,all this just to barely beat memphis in their second b2b game
pos,Neg,i would love to see this sub explodes if the lakers starts 0 3 too bad it did not happen
pos,Neg,win doesn t count grizzlies are playing back to back and also dillon brooks didn t play gotta move the goalpost or whatever make the haters sleep at night lol
pos,Pos,we suck
neg,Pos,9 turnovers lol
pos,Pos,damn westbrook was straight trash again 5 for 15 with nine turnovers
pos,Pos,westbrick is shit and we are relying on melo to bail us out kill me
pos,Pos,missing dillon brooks and on a segababa you ve been warned league
pos,Pos,what the fuck was that call at the end so fucking bogus
pos,Pos,as we all expected the 2021 lakers getting their first win off the back of melo sure reddit will love this
pos,Pos,the last 2 minutes in that thread was saltier than a pickle gahd dayum
pos,Neg,the drummond curse is over
pos,Pos,if any of you think that ja morant missed ft made you sad you have no idea how much this will morph ja he wont let that happen again
neg,Neg,lebron james revenge game
pos,Pos,man lakers are reminding me of a mixture of 2017 18 cavs with the 2018 19 lakers and that s not a good thing
pos,Pos,playing lebron 40 minutes against the grizzlies when they re on a back to back shows they re desperate to not go down 3 0
neg,Neg,ja blew the last free throw but you cant get mad at him man is so consistent every game and he carries grizzlies on his back
pos,Pos,a win is a win but usually when you shoot 53 fg and 53 from 3 you win by a lot more than 3 especially when the other team shoots 45 fg 37 from 3
pos,Neg,explain to me the last play out of bounds from westbrook 10th turnover and they gave the ball to the lakers what the fuck was that
pos,Pos,never in doubt
pos,Pos,ja is a monster not a softie like the lakers bigs
pos,Neg,ja russ
pos,Pos,fuck the refs
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,feels good to get in the win column especially beating the refs at the end
pos,Pos,getting to play a player like schroder instead of jeff teague is just amazing
neg,Neg,tatum wanted that 40 lmao edit tatum and brown combine for 71 on 54 47 91 edit 2 is this going to be timelord s consistent 30 mins season
pos,Pos,kelly oubre really took over the game in ot but not in a good way
pos,Pos,celtics put in a strong performance to beat the best team in the league the charlotte hornets great exposure for the celtics moving forward
pos,Pos,where can we get one of those timelords i keep hearing about
pos,Pos,i will be returning to watch more charlotte hornets basketball in the future
neg,Pos,lamelo really already has that curry green light really fun player to watch
pos,Neg,that fucking brown posterizer was the equivalent of finish him in mortal kombat first the clutch three than the morale killing smash
pos,Pos,brown and smart came up with huge plays at the end shouts out to tatum with the huge statline wow
pos,Neg,hurt
neg,Pos,rip 82 0 hornets
pos,Pos,you considered jaylen brown
pos,Pos,what a game
pos,Pos,finally we get a good game from both the jays fun game
neg,Pos,hack a plumlee the only way to defeat the hornets fuck i wish we had pj tonight
neg,Neg,celtics casually beating the best team in the league
pos,Pos,what a awesome game hornets are fun af and jaylen brown how do you doooo
pos,Neg,fucking tatum and brown must they score so many points really fun game
pos,Neg,dennis had a quiet 23 6 8
neg,Neg,can t be too mad at that effort by the buzzy bois btw if you re looking for another team to root for we have the best memes in the league not even a joke no other sub compares
pos,Pos,watching charlotte scoring with such ease from so many different players is exhausting it took an awesome night from tatum and brown schroder and smart to even keep pace with them
pos,Pos,just wanna say shoutout jabari parker helped us keep up in the beginning
pos,Pos,can t believe we pulled that off jt and jb playing well in the same game damn
pos,Neg,gg charlotte you guys look very tough you guys will have plenty to cheer this year believe it
pos,Pos,apologize to marcus pls
pos,Pos,homicidal jaylen brown i missed it
pos,Pos,make no mistake the hornets are a good team they played us tough they were without rozier pj washington bridges is the truth dude s improved so much since the last time i saw him at michigan state
neg,Pos,charlotte becoming must watch basketball
pos,Pos,tatum almost injuring himself on a drive while trying to get to 40 after the game was already over lol
pos,Pos,why dont the jays play well together
pos,Pos,hornets so close so close
pos,Pos,robert williams looking super special this year
neg,Neg,robert williams looks so fuckin legit playing heavy minutes too
pos,Pos,hornets blew it a good loss though against a great team that seemed to play at the same pace as them this game will make them better btw hornets need a dependable big man one that can shoot free throws catch passes and finish too much to ask for
pos,Pos,fucking overtimeeeee what the fuck babbyyyyy is fuckkkking backk
pos,Pos,way closer than the final score indicates ball is the real deal the jays and dennis were great jabari was essential in the early going good back and forth game between two pretty determined teams
pos,Pos,last years celtics would ve folded once they went down 10 in the 4th loved the resiliency in that win
pos,Pos,that was just a terribly coached and played close to that game we were up 12 with six minutes left and the celtics started pressing we started sprinting up the floor every possession and driving for contested layups either missing them or turning the ball over that s exactly what the pressing team wants in that situation gotta understand time and score there also i said it in the stands why call a timeout with the ball and a chance to win because then you have to inbound it you had the ball in the hands of the exact player you d want with the ball in that situation why call that timeout your worst case is ot
neg,Pos,jordan you better give my boy lamelo a proper fucking center
pos,Neg,those mvp chants coming in strong with tatum at the line fucking inject it into my veins
neg,Pos,oubre dosen t need to see closing minutes ever again talk about a shitshow from him
pos,Pos,schroder was great
pos,Pos,that was a very fun game
pos,Pos,if gordon hayward was a nice and respectable man he would give all of his salary to miles because hes the one who actually deserves it
neg,Pos,charlotte is a really good team
pos,Pos,hey teams playing the celtics please keep inbounding and keep going after marcus smart it ll turn out great for you guys
neg,Neg,need to get rozier and washington back
neg,Neg,gg fuck you plumlee make your damn fts
pos,Pos,tatum is finishing top 5 in mvp
neg,Pos,hornets games are so fun to watch
pos,Pos,tatum and brown finally had a good game at the same time smart makes a game saving defensive play and that rob williams dunk to take the lead with 1 42 in regulation was so awesome this is the celtics basketball i like to see
pos,Pos,op s username come on
neg,Pos,what the hell is your username my guy
pos,Pos,fun game too much iso for charlotte in the late still a learning process for lamelo
pos,Neg,wonder when bouknight will get a shot out there think he could be a good second unit scoring option but i m sure his defense is far off from what borego wants
pos,Pos,schroeder flying under the radar but very solid game from him as well
pos,Neg,as an unbiased observer this was a bit of a choke by the hornets
pos,Pos,first time i watched a lemelo ball game start to finish it felt like he was the best player in this game it also seems like the charlotte front court guys really really love playing with him i hope we find some of that juju for our team closest thing we have is when rob williams starts leaping but it seems like he s on some kind of no jumping until the fourth quarter plan
pos,Pos,oubre lol
pos,Neg,j a y s o n a y l e n
pos,Pos,pls no more overtimes this shit wasn t good for my blood pressure
neg,Neg,the downfall of jayson tatum has been greatly exaggerated
pos,Pos,lamelo shooting better on 3s than 2s this year great job facilitating by tatum today celtics don t have that traditional floor general pg but they have the personnel to create a pg by committee situation and a key piece of that will be tatum using his scoring threat to set up others
neg,Pos,god i wish i drove down to charlotte for this game the 2 hour drive would have been so worth it
neg,Neg,what a game the hornets are really fun this year
pos,Pos,so what s the consensus do we think kanter didn t play because he sucks because we didn t need him this game or because of the winnie the shoe situation
neg,Pos,missed rozier in this one also borrego needed to make better plays in ot
pos,Pos,borrego aint it
pos,Pos,it seems like the celtics can turn on their defense and become a good basketball team otherwise only robert williams is a consistent contributor on d including marcus despite being a great defender he has taken possessions off so far this season as long as this team doesn t play defense every possession i m worried they ll be just as mediocre as last season
pos,Pos,so the warriors would be looking fucking deadly if they picked ball ya
pos,Pos,this is the one of the loudest crowds i ve ever heard that wasn t a playoff game i love it
pos,Pos,jaylon bratum that is all
pos,Pos,4 games in 3 overtime cs should get a day off to rest those legs
neg,Pos,as soon as hornets called that time out in their last shot i knew celtics is stealing that in bounds pass play
pos,Pos,miles bridges finna be an all star if not also mip
neg,Neg,oubre has 19 but it didn t feel like he was doing much
neg,Pos,hornets won t make playoffs yet again
pos,Pos,hayward kinda gave the best chance at a w away with that terrible inbound to lamelo at the end of regulation why on earth did he hesitate
pos,Pos,terrible offense and defense from boston and charlotte to close the game charlotte also played terrible defense and boston didn t
neg,Pos,good win for boston but every time he was on the floor ball was the best player on the court imo dude is unreal
neg,Pos,i wasn t even sure giannis would be playing at the beginning of the season with what happened in the playoffs all we can do is marvel at this greek god
pos,Pos,giannis ft 10 13
neg,Neg,thanasis is coming into his own this season he s a bit reckless at times but i m already noticing massive improvements since last season
pos,Pos,boy thank god the sixers didn t trade for brogdon i know simmons is a good player but i really really think that brogdon and the 6ers would ve been a match made in heaven
pos,Pos,its so cool to see thanasis start he missed an easy bucket kinda at the beggining but he had quick hands and forced some turnovers
pos,Pos,elder wand rules mean the trophy is back with the bucks now
pos,Pos,giannis has not lost to a central division foe while playing since december of 2018
pos,Pos,nwora is a player
pos,Pos,greek man good
pos,Pos,jrue lopez donte and portis not available that s 3 starters and thier best bench player and yet they can still beat a good team on thier home court the bucks are loaded man
pos,Pos,giannis is almost automatic from ft line now unstoppable i sense another mvp
pos,Pos,the depth of this bucks team is so much better than it was last season without giving up anything in the starting five yes pj is a loss but pat connaughton appears to have taken a huge leap nwora has taken a huge leap thanasis has taken a leap one of grayson allen donte will come off the bench and i cannot stress this enough we have george hill instead of jeff teague as a back up pg
pos,Pos,this thread was half an hour late and bally is still having problems with stuttering
neg,Pos,add sabonis to the list of jordan n block ra s victim
pos,Pos,why do bucks flairs still have the championship trophy next to them before i get attacked it s because they usually revert to normal when the next season starts also bucks look great
pos,Pos,man that double tech was weak felt like the jawing was what forced the double tech call rather than them lightly touching each other s face neck i listened to the bucks call live where marques johnson wanted no techs and for play to continue listened to the pacer s call and they wanted a tech and a hostile act for middleton touching goga s face wildly soft stuff from the pacer s announcers on this one i think
pos,Pos,nice
pos,Neg,giannis good
neg,Pos,barely over 10 000 to see the defending champs goddamn
pos,Pos,demar dragged our asses to a win while everyone else was floundering in every way imaginable bless up and to everyone who said he didn t fit smd
pos,Pos,boy we tried real hard to lose this game lmao
pos,Pos,raps might not end up being a good team this year but goddamn you re not going to have a fun time playing them
pos,Pos,we won this game because of demar period
pos,Pos,scottie barnes kinda similar to a young giannis dude has the frame to be a superstar remindme 5 years
neg,Pos,chicago bulls legend demar derozen
pos,Pos,banger game
neg,Neg,fvv gary og scottie pascal needs to happen
neg,Neg,i can t say he played perfectly but damn fvv put his fucking heart out there for this one crazy game
pos,Pos,scottie barnes arena
neg,Neg,demar still feeling as disrespected by the raptors as ujiri does with edward rogers derozan really came to work today
pos,Neg,scottie barnes is a toronto raptor fuck
neg,Pos,toronto has a legit home court advantage
pos,Pos,bring siakam into that closing lineup that s gotta be hell to play against
neg,Pos,what a move by fvv at the end
pos,Pos,gg the bulls defense was way nastier than i was expecting deballzach work great together though i feel like they re one more big man and some chemistry development away from making serious noise also happy to see the raps not just give up
neg,Neg,bulls are a well built team man very good bulls being top of the east again makes me feel nostalgic gg
pos,Neg,gg bulls your announcers are cool
pos,Pos,scottie barnes is the future
pos,Pos,26 4 6 a nice little homecoming stat for derozan
pos,Pos,bruh an og scottie pascal and vanvleet lineup is going to be hell defensively gg toronto
pos,Pos,we got fucking lucky asf gg toronto
pos,Pos,hot damn we tried throwing this game
pos,Pos,if freddy hits that woulda broke the subreddit
pos,Pos,man the raptors are still a good ass team all the talk of their demise was way exaggerated og looked like he s taken a leap scottie is super impressive and that defense is still phenomenal they had us completely disoriented and frazzled with their full court press thank goodness for demar haha we obviously need to learn how to close out close games and that s why the demar signing was so big for us a bunch of good players who haven t built up that experience yet because of the teams they ve been on so there s demar to settle the ship great game
pos,Pos,one day we will win a game on our home floor this season gg bulls
neg,Pos,that 4th wasn t good for my heart demar really been a raptor killer since we traded him
pos,Pos,despite our best efforts to blow it we pulled it out baby
pos,Pos,real good fucking test of closing out games raptors made it tough and that s what this team needs we need to be kept on our toes also is that another game of zach fling scoreless in the first quarter demar is a god send for this squad able to hold it down while lavine s shots aren t falling also looks like they ll be practicing in bounds and playing against traps lmfao
pos,Neg,demar haters crying and throwing up rn
neg,Pos,tough loss but damn that was a fun game to watch bulls look great this season and i m excited to see how they do
pos,Pos,deballzack still undefeated
pos,Pos,we gonna be so good when siakam comes back
pos,Pos,vuc tried his hardest to lose that one lol
pos,Pos,derozan is just too smooth with it
neg,Pos,raptors tried to break your streak they gave you a good test
pos,Pos,demar s contract already paying dividends
pos,Neg,demar so this is what it feels like to be lebron
pos,Neg,that was a hectic finish lmao
neg,Pos,despite the bulls best efforts to lose this game they did finally win they re looking real good
pos,Pos,i know is pain
neg,Pos,that was an incredible fourth quarter shame we lost but i m very impressed with the performance
neg,Neg,fred with a career high 17 ast and 8 to haha
pos,Neg,freddy balled tf out at the end there
pos,Pos,that game was a banger our defence really brought us back into it down 20 but demar was too clutch in the 4th
pos,Pos,fuck me am i becoming a bulls fan
pos,Pos,that 4th quarter was ugly but a win is a win
pos,Pos,i really do enjoy playing the raptors we have such a good friendly rivalry hopefully it goes back to being super competitive again
pos,Pos,dam that was a nice game gg bulls kept it real interesting till the end
pos,Pos,fvv willed them back in this game he looked pissed walking back to the dressing room with both hands in a fist demar is so fucken smooth competitive games are great but this team needs wins before it starts feeling like tampa
neg,Pos,i could do with not having to face og and scottie barnes much in the season barnes is so fucking good
pos,Pos,the way fred crossed vuc and made that mfer woozy if that 3 went in i d have gone nuts ggs
pos,Pos,woah canada you have your own separate sportscenter
pos,Pos,really fuck with this roster despite the last couple losses these guys play hard and that s all i can ask for as a fan
pos,Pos,tough loss there but that was a really good game demar made some killer shots in the 4th
pos,Pos,such a good game freddie did everything right to get an open shot at the end such a shame he couldn t cap off a great comeback and a great individual night with a win
neg,Pos,it s official again the chicago bulls are the best team in the league 4 0 third highest point differential at 10 4th best in points per game allowed at 97 5 gm tied for 8th in team fg at 46 5 3rd in team 3pt at 42 3 3rd in team ft at 86 4 tied for 10th in least turnovers per game at 14 gm 3rd in steals per game at 10 2 gm 6th in blocks per game at 6 5 gm tied for 5th in defensive rating at 97 7 4th in net rating at 10 0 tied for 6th in assist at 62 8th in ts at 57 2 3rd in pts off turnovers at 25 gm alex caruso 2nd in steals per game at 3 25 gm
neg,Neg,what a fuckin game man my god
pos,Pos,a win is a win but damn that last quarter was embarrassing
pos,Neg,i know that lonzo turnover had bulls fans sweating
pos,Pos,i take back everything i ever said about fred not being able to run an offense 17 assists is nutty
pos,Pos,lucky to squeak that one out gg raptors
pos,Pos,this game was fucking ugly
pos,Pos,didn t throw the game
pos,Neg,bulls are 4 oh
pos,Pos,despite zo having quite a few brain off moments at the end there he had a great game on both sides of the court
pos,Pos,god damn what a great game caruso had some clutch defensive plays in the 4th and of course demar hits a mid range every time we seem to gain some momentum i really want to see fvv run the pnr with scottie barnes and have him make the decision to either drive or pass from the high post like draymond green i feel like he s standing around too much on the offensive end and this should be a good way to make use of his playmaking abilities
neg,Neg,bull s been going under the radar but imo this is the true super team
pos,Pos,toronto and nick nurse get huge props for their defense in the second half they turned it up and really pushed the bulls out of their comfort zone and were able to create a lot of momentum
neg,Pos,deballzach can t be beat
neg,Pos,scottie barnes is the real deal going to be a nightmare in a couple years
pos,Pos,the raptors will find a way to the play in at minimum too well coached too many above average good players loved seeing the toronto crowd back in their house it was very noticeable let s see how lavine crew handle this tough stretch coming up
neg,Neg,guys i think the bulls ain t playing this year holy shit they re seriously good
neg,Pos,just like derozan when i shoot it goes in
pos,Pos,lonzo and vuc tried their best to choke that away
neg,Pos,just because the bulls won it was still a dumb decision not to foul in the last posession fvv had an extremely clean look
pos,Pos,vuc absolutely falling apart at the end for the bulls
pos,Pos,bulls kept trying to hand the game to the raptors lmao what was that ending
neg,Neg,why didn t vuc foul
pos,Pos,nobody looks happy after this win good stay hungry
neg,Pos,a win s a win but if this is the way we execute down the stretch i m fucking worried for the upcoming 13 games
pos,Pos,ngl i almost had a heart attack that last minute
pos,Neg,everything except the 4th qtr looked good today still happy we got the w tho
pos,Pos,won the bulls 2 spread this game had me dying
pos,Neg,i think we take this with siakam but gg bulls demar was clutch down the stretch
pos,Pos,don t let the score fool you it was much closer than that
pos,Pos,well i think this game really showed bulls need a shot blocker bulls look like they have a good defense but when things start falling apart they just don t have a fallback option
neg,Pos,can t wait to watch 2 undefeated teams battle it out on november 12th for my very first live nba game warriors
pos,Pos,now i know how it feels to be on the other side of a demar takeover the dude was unstoppable in the 4th scoring on both barnes and og
neg,Neg,heartbreaking loss but it was a fun game gg bulls
neg,Pos,i love this damn team so fun to watch
pos,Pos,you just lost to the 82nd best player oh wait
pos,Pos,bulls dare i say are spooky
pos,Pos,admit the bulls are good rn or forever hold your peace
pos,Pos,demar and lavine close to that superstar stat range of 25 5 plus
pos,Pos,though this game was pretty rough this is the most fun i ve had watching a bulls team in half a decade
neg,Pos,the bulls starting 5 is loaded lonzo finally being what he s supposed to be kind of changes that entire team just loaded and i still don t understand why lakers let go of caruso he was far more useful and valuable next to lebron and ad compared to westbrook and caruso was doing damage off the ball on both ends of the floor westbrook at this point is just a glorified contract that kills your team on the floor and on the books he s almost useless without the ball and if you have lebron on your team you wouldn t want anyone else to have the ball regardless just a horrendous fit they could still make it work because lebron is lebron he has always done more with less and maybe he can even elevate westbrook to a different level but it s still a horrible fit with lebron and ad all you need more is shooting and defensive depth westbrook literally gives none of that
pos,Pos,bulls didn t react well to some tough 2nd half defense playing not to lose they will clean it up zach also needs to work on taking advantage of the double and triple teams everyone is laying on him he is awesome but not that awesome jordan had to learn the same thing i think demar will guide him this is the way
pos,Pos,no one is safe from the bulls
pos,Pos,greatest start since the 96 97 season
pos,Pos,this bulls team is fun to watch
pos,Pos,as a lakers fan it s really bittersweet watching these bulls especially lonzo i m stoked he s blossomed into such a solid player seeing him and caruso together brings a tear to my eye seeing the bulls having so much fun is hard to watch while ad and dwight are having a dick measuring contest on the lakers bench
pos,Pos,damn another nice game from scottie barnes has me worried about cade lol dudes gonna be under a lot of pressure to perform from game one
neg,Neg,i m kinda loving this bulls team they re low key scary like they don t seem so but then the horror builds and builds and they re terrifying
neg,Pos,demar derozan came up clutch when bulls needed him most he silenced the raptors crowd 3 times in the last 4 minutes
pos,Pos,gotta give a lot of credit to the raps they never gave up even when down big they played really well down the stretch forcing turnovers demar just bailed us out
neg,Neg,it truly sucks that we made all those little mistakes and still barely lost feel like we couldve easily won this one with simply a higher percentage of easy layups made with that being said those kinks will work themselves out and i think this was a pretty promising loss the bulls are a damn good team and we don t even have siakam yet
neg,Pos,so i love the bulls and i m not afraid to say it
pos,Neg,y all look different
pos,Pos,but how will derozan fit in this team like this m fer
pos,Pos,classic billy donovan late game execution almost threw away the game
pos,Pos,never in doubt
pos,Pos,thank god for the bulls though chicago fandom hurts
pos,Neg,well that end of the game was stupidly stressful as hell but hey 4 0
pos,Pos,never had a doubt
pos,Neg,we really need pascal lol the halfcourt offense is just so ugly
neg,Neg,bulls doing their seattle seahawks impersonation giving their fans heart attacks
pos,Pos,that was beautiful separation from fred at the end sometimes it just doesn t drop ggs that became fun as hell
neg,Pos,gg bulls sooo many stupid turnovers for the raps this game
neg,Neg,we really tried to pay homage to the 2020 bulls there for a whole ass quarter
pos,Pos,so close yet so far away
pos,Neg,neva lost
pos,Neg,we need another big off the bench for sure fucking love 4 0 though
pos,Pos,entertaining game great late fake comeback lol had way too many turnovers but the raps stuck in there and had a chance to get it to ot demar was clutch down the stretch for the bulls and i like what i saw from fvv og and gary trent jr
pos,Pos,fucking hell what a game
pos,Pos,that ending was an ending all right
neg,Pos,guys i don t want to overreact but i don t think the bulls are ever going to lose again
pos,Pos,go bulls go
neg,Neg,what a game the last quarter was so fun
pos,Pos,great game i take a lot of pleasure seeing the bulls with a competent team they play really hard and look strong to start
pos,Pos,watched this game in person and man halftime to the 4th quarter it was so wild to watch and hear the crowd
pos,Pos,patrick williams doing his best avery bradley tony snell impression again
pos,Pos,best bulls team ever no doubt
pos,Pos,i miss him
pos,Pos,yo let me on that bull s bandwagon
pos,Pos,bulls are looking scary this year
pos,Pos,bulls on fire
pos,Pos,said it when they got demar will say it again this bulls team is fuckin awesome
pos,Pos,derozan is looking good on a bulls jersey
pos,Pos,deballzach
neg,Pos,this team is fun it s been awhile
neg,Pos,lonzo shooting over 50 from the 3
pos,Pos,derozen is a cold blooded midrange killer he is going to win us a ton of close games this season singlehandedly
pos,Pos,demar derozan is good at basketball
pos,Neg,derozan was beautiful late game lavine moved passed mj for 3 pointers lonzo was great on defense and from 3 we almost lost because of chemistry related absent minded turnovers og and scottie looked amazing and that raptors defense late was suffocating as all hell
pos,Pos,i m so happy to see lonzo playing well on a team that appreciates his skills and plays to his strengths as a nets fan i saw that the same management in la that dumped d lo for him was putting too much pressure on him to succeed and new orleans forget it what a mess i never really bought into lonzo being a bust glad to see him doing well
pos,Pos,can we pretend just for tonight that the raptors still play in tampa bay please
pos,Pos,4 0 doesn t count bulls haven t played a good team
pos,Pos,lol raps
pos,Pos,tough loss man
pos,Pos,damn missed layups bit us in the end
pos,Neg,zachdeballvic 2021 allstar campaign
pos,Pos,another w stressful ass game and this knicks game on thursday looms large so fucking hyped to be 4 0 though
neg,Neg,pain
neg,Pos,can t wait for thursdays game it s gunna be like running into yoyour ex while with you hot new girlfriend
pos,Pos,bulls aren t a joke okay chicago i m watching you now bulls will be 3 in the east
pos,Neg,patrick williams taking only steps backwards bulls undefeated i am conflicted but happy
pos,Pos,all the closet bulls fans coming out me included now i just need my miami dolphins to come out of the doldrum
pos,Pos,hahaha suck it
pos,Neg,i have been gone along time from the world of basketball these rosters look like a 2k simulation a few years into the future
pos,Pos,i m happy og is scoring well and i hope he develops it more
neg,Neg,fvv really said if dragic aint gonna do it then i ll fucking do it
pos,Pos,turns out it s a bad idea to have point guards guard jimmy butler
pos,Pos,as a michigan fan franz has completely been outplaying my expectations so far his 3 point shot has been inconsistent as i expected but his defense passing and iq have been great he makes great cuts the rim always knows where to be on both ends of floor and knows when to make the extra pass being able to watch him individually as a player has been fun
pos,Pos,ggs magic friends that 10 0 run in the 2nd quarter was tight as hell
pos,Pos,jimmy heard y all talking shit
pos,Pos,jimbo
pos,Neg,a miami vs orlando game that wasn t close forgot those existed
pos,Pos,we survived terrance ross bad man didnt hurt us
pos,Pos,jack harlow sheck wes
pos,Pos,nice performance by everyone let pj relax he has to guard kd on wednesday anyway love to see herro have a good game outside of scoring
pos,Neg,awesome dominating performance controlled the game for all 4 quarters very unusual given our performances against orlando are typically subpar maybe ross being unusually cold contributed to that jimmy was phenomenal brilliant efficient 36pt performance herro came back down to earth tonight scoring wise but he passed very well ft was a perfect 100 tonight 3 ball was off and it didn t even matter you love to see it markieff morris really impressed me tonight did not expect him to so well rounded good bounce back win after a tough l against indiana we re on to brooklyn
neg,Neg,jimmy revenge season baby
pos,Pos,herro 6moty and mip
pos,Pos,wait r nba told me that jimmy s contract was gonna be bad for us because he had a bad game against the pacers he sure did score a lot of points with such a broken jump shot
pos,Pos,how has suggs looked really liked him coming out of gonzaga
pos,Pos,when you shoot 22 from 3 but still win by 17
pos,Pos,9 assists for herro that s got to be a career high
pos,Pos,hope fultz comes back soon
pos,Pos,of course t ross goes 0 7 after torching us
pos,Pos,jimothy g buckets is my boy
neg,Pos,i find it so funny that when the heat lose there s every other teams fan coming in here saying we suck jimmy sucks heat win with a jimbo 36 pt game and it s allll heat fans in here lol r nba is garbage
pos,Pos,we got rekt franz is good transition defense non existent kinda tough to expect many wins against good teams with this current squad especially b2b
pos,Pos,cole anthony back to being a bum i see
pos,Neg,patty mills
pos,Pos,aww kuzmania didn t show up today
pos,Pos,joey is losing in this battle with the yips
neg,Pos,damn it nets we were so close to going 82 0
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,friendship ended with joe harris now patty mills is my best friend
pos,Pos,kd is having his best start since his mvp season and no one is talking about for some reason
pos,Pos,officiating is so different this year i swear they only called blatant fouls tonight anything close on either end they just let go i like the change but the refs gotta stay consistent
neg,Pos,joe harris should absolutely not be driving to the basket lol
pos,Pos,both joe harris and patty mills 3pt form will regress to the mean but in the end nets could have 2 great shooters for the season
pos,Pos,james harden is kinda mid right now
pos,Pos,this dude harden lmao
pos,Pos,harden statlines ain t pretty these days
pos,Pos,big pimpin
pos,Neg,what a brickfest from both teams also i know everyone is super into the new reffing right now which is cool but if refs ignore actual fouls in the paint which was happening all game for both teams it s gonna lead to a ton of jump shots which can be kinda boring to watch especially in a game like today where both teams shot like crap
pos,Pos,harden has been garbage
neg,Pos,wizards were stuck in mud the entire game offensively they could not hit anything i guess our shooting was pretty bad too was nice seeing dinwiddie again
pos,Pos,ugly offensive game all around lol the defense wasn t even as good as the final score would indicate both teams bricked tons of open shots
neg,Neg,the wizards always beat the nets
pos,Neg,future play in tournament game
neg,Neg,harden prime is gone yikes
neg,Pos,3 free throws you love to see it
pos,Neg,joe harris has been ice cold to start the season hope he can turn it around and not just for fantasy reasons
neg,Neg,are people going to pretend beal didn t try to play basketball last night on the same floor kyrie cannot new york mandate who needs enemies when you have friends like durant and harden all in or all out
neg,Neg,bertans looking like a bad contract
pos,Pos,john collins body count increasing rapidly
pos,Pos,if you see this comment you ve been baptized by john collins
neg,Pos,well i guess i have to roll the clip
neg,Pos,i hope jc gets frequent std checks he s caught a lot of bodies recently
pos,Pos,john collins is going to have a vince carter esque career dunking highlight reel
pos,Pos,it was a close game then casey went with our bench for like 13 minutes lol we went from a 7 point game to a 22 point game at least killian looked decent still work to do but his offense got into a rhythm
neg,Neg,cam reddish is an elite two way wing
pos,Pos,atlanta should get more credit for keeping this code together i don t expect they ll have a warriors type breakout but they definitely have a bright future and can contend seriously should everyone keep developing
pos,Pos,cade needs to save this team
neg,Neg,that was a close game guys
pos,Pos,holy fuck can a detroit sports team win a game brutal fall
pos,Pos,detroit sports in shambles rn
neg,Pos,detroit about to have a dope rebuild after they pull of this last tanking season new hawks
pos,Neg,thank you trae for putting my fantasy team ahead
neg,Pos,trae mvp season countinues
pos,Pos,john collins 22 points in 24 minutes
pos,Pos,i want timothe luwawu carrabot to be better than he is i feel like he looks like cam reddish did last year hes trying to do too much with his limited opportunities hes rushing his jumper and his drives and his handle looks sloppy from how much he is jumping the gun hope he can provide a bit more in his minutes as the season goes o and he settles into his role
pos,Pos,people really talked up this cade cleverpig but he s done nothing to help the pistons win it s like he s not even out there
neg,Neg,lol pistons fans saying they would make the play in
neg,Neg,pistons are a disgrace with that g league roster why is every pro team in detroit such garbage
neg,Pos,herbert jones 31 5 minutes 1 fga man knows his role
pos,Pos,yall know what time it is
neg,Neg,my guy bi is ice cold 4 straight iso buckets to seal the game
pos,Neg,man the twolves are lucky ant looks this good this early because dlo has been atrocious out there
pos,Neg,d lo has to be up there for the the idea of him is better than the reality first team looks so smooth but is so inconsistent inefficient
pos,Pos,brandon ingram is a killer great game from the pels
pos,Pos,the slenderman iced this game like the amazing player he is cannot wait to see this team with zion
pos,Pos,brandon ingram is an assassin
neg,Neg,that was a tough game to watch the good news is that our defense still looks solid as long as we have our best players our there kat in particular looked much improved on defense also credit for him for regaining his calm after that nightmare first quarter the bad news is our offense is looking funky we re too reliant on three s dropping instead of running plays to get easy points especially when kat isn t out there how funny would it be that it turns out we re a better defensive team than offensive team
neg,Neg,bi is him
pos,Neg,dlo will get it together offensively but he looks really bad on that end so far in the early going he s a streaky scorer but once he finds it it s a beautiful thing to watch
pos,Pos,lets go man first dub of the season
pos,Pos,jonas is the 3rd star we found him
neg,Neg,who dat flock tf up
neg,Neg,fun game ant edwards scared me with that amazing 3rd quarter he is really unstoppable on the open floor
neg,Neg,brandon ingram is special
neg,Neg,at some point finch needs to do what is obvious here i m sure ant was tired from putting the team on his back in the 3rd but the end game needs to run through him not dlo dlo is the 3rd banana here and he needs to accept that credit to val for his game and ingram and graham for hitting big shots to stem the tide and keep us at bay
neg,Pos,unfamiliar with this pels team who s herbert jones
pos,Pos,the motherfucking herb machine came in again with that sweet 1
neg,Neg,jv was absurdly good tonight he is completely as advertised i understand his defense isn t the best but it s not for lack of effort he wore kat out tonight on both ends also bi the closer magnificent performance from him down the stretch
pos,Pos,meh pels deserved this one insanely chippy game i don t have any doubt that the offense will be good but it s looked insanely bad i know they focused almost entirely on defense during training camp so i ll give it some time
pos,Pos,brandon ingram better be an all star this season those 4 straight shots to seal the game were just insane edwards went nuclear in the 3rd so glad he didn t do that the entire game tell me again how graham and jv were terrible moves for the pels
pos,Pos,fuck yeah popped our cherry for the year finally
pos,Pos,embarrassing showing from the wolves at home
pos,Pos,congrats to willie green and the pels we played like utter shit and the pels played like they really wanted it
pos,Pos,when dlo s shot isn t falling he offers little to nothing to your team paying him 25mm to take the ball out of ant s hands is very frustrating
neg,Pos,shot like crap got outrebounded by 19 only lost by 9 how
pos,Neg,few thoughts here really disappointing that finch didn t run more plays through edwards in the 4th d lo got the rock most of the 4th and made only 1 3 and bricked like 4 edwards had a hot 3rd he didn t start to get the ball until the game was nearly out of reach with like 3 4 minutes to go no idea why russell got so much there jonas was a monster on offense no answer for him but kat had some good defense at times on him there s a reason why jonas went 7 18 but he was the player of the game imo monster on boards drew fouls like crazy took advantage of mismatches ingram had his way he ended the game by himself with those iso mid rangers he made a really tough one over mcdaniels but he had some really easy ones whenever mcdaniels was not guarding him beverley baby he was amazing i felt that he should have closed the game instead he was knocking down 3s playing elite defense and the team was feeding off his energy wolves fans in the arena were loving him if anything he should have closed over beasley now that one makes more sense i m liking wolves defense but they still have work to do when bev is on the bench and opponents create switches that take mcdaniels off his assignment because it leads to wolves bleeding points we saw it whenever ingram wasn t guarded by mcdaniels although ingran still got points on him they weren t easy but i d rather get beat by making it tough on ingram over him getting easy points on russell edwards beasley ultimately what really killed wolves was being cold from 3 it let pels stack the paint essentially taking away easy layups dunks that we saw edwards get all 3rd quarter if russell beasley and co were able to knock down from 3 then this game would have been so much different pels would then have to guard the perimeter and edwards would have feasted at the rim instead they just placed 3 4 bodies in there and let wolves brick 3s all 4th quarter
pos,Pos,i ll say it before the offseason unfortunately dlo aint it i think a jordan carkson role is best for him
neg,Pos,how do we blame david griffin for this one
pos,Pos,bi is on a zion needs to hurry up before another reason is ruined with this duo
neg,Pos,win some lose some but could ve won this one
pos,Pos,pels just need to try and tread water with zion out
pos,Pos,dlo plays so stupid still
pos,Pos,it s ok guys we goin 81 1 and that s not a bad thing
neg,Neg,jv is a monster bi and devonte looked really good as well man i can t wait to see this roster with a healthy zion
pos,Pos,another all star year for bi that man was on fire i gotta give props to ant though watching him cut through our guys like a knife in the 3rd was not fun now i know how people feel when zion bulldozes through the lane
pos,Pos,once we figured out how to get jv the entry pass everything else fell perfectly into place
pos,Neg,ant future
pos,Neg,herb is the secret ingredient we haven t had this kind of defensive impact since the zion era began
pos,Pos,ingram just iced that game clutch
pos,Pos,wolves have a point guard problem the lack of a bruiser big was also glaring tonight
pos,Pos,79 3 here we come
pos,Pos,jv is the stronger gorilla
pos,Pos,memphis and toronto fans lemme know if you considered jv and underrated defender because he s been better than advertised on that end
pos,Pos,kat needs to quit being a baby his foul trouble is screwing the team
pos,Pos,ingram valanciunas the wolves playing their worst offensive game of the season and what will likely end as their worst offensive game of the year seems like a losing formula interested to see how the wolves look wednesday milwaukee and vs denver at home in their next 2
neg,Pos,can t have kat have 32 and ant have 28 and lose to the pelicans man
pos,Pos,what a shocker thought wolves would win this
pos,Pos,herbert jones out here looking dangerous
pos,Pos,bi is the goat bro i ve been saying this u mfs r a lil behind
pos,Pos,morey is the biggest winner this game this mad lad actually gonna pull it off by holding ben like he s a gamestop investor just make the trade already wolves lmao
pos,Pos,free kat man
pos,Pos,kinda similar to how the knicks magic played out yesterday in terms of a back to back matchup where the 2nd game was gonna be much tougher for the team that won first timberwolves and the team that lost pelicans were much more fired up this game to win
pos,Pos,surprising how poop the wolves are
pos,Pos,i had tons of twolves fans jump down my throat when i said d lo was a bottom 1 3rd starting pg i may have been wrong he may be better assessed as a 6th man
pos,Pos,minnesota wtf
pos,Pos,valanciunas with a rare 20 20 20 game with 20 points 20 rebounds and 20 fouls
pos,Pos,timberwolves oof
pos,Neg,beautiful result the stronger team won
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,its unfortunate the wolves couldnt keep the momentum from the 3rd quarter in the 4th good game though
pos,Pos,guess kat forgot to watch the two gorillas fighting before the game to get pumped maybe all he did was watch two chipmunks fight smh
pos,Pos,don t be fooled by the 32 14 7 towns played utterly garbage outside of ant in the second half and beverly everyone on this team needs to take this loss to heart
pos,Pos,fuck the refs seriously some call or non call was crazy
pos,Pos,u zmajxd still feel like beating the lakers
neg,Pos,i m really upset because i don t see us beating milwaukee denver lakers phoenix etc so these are the games we should be winning the pels really are trash without zion but somehow this is the product we put up and this is what s supposed to make the fans believe in the team and honestly this is l is on finch and the prior game almost went the same way but d lo bailed us out i have no idea what happened to the man over the summer but he has tried to make the twolves into a defence first team at the expense of the only thing which was good about us and that was our offence he also needs to make ant kat and d lo be held accountable because they are literally taking turns isoing and everyone else just watches
pos,Pos,i hate jonas valanciunas i hate gerson rosas and i fucking despise ed malloy
neg,Pos,when the timberwolves lose i win
pos,Neg,morey is getting a call about dlo ben swap soon
pos,Pos,numbers don t reflect the game ant and kat played poorly kat really needs to get out of his head he s more concerned of getting the right calls than winning the game ant needs to be aggressive from the start pelicans without zion have no business keeping the game close or winning
pos,Pos,the biggest story of the season is love remembering how to play basketball
pos,Pos,jokic and barton 14 for 24 rest of nuggets 21 for 62
pos,Neg,its easy just start 3 7 footers
neg,Neg,who switched the cavs for a team who holds a lead the entire game and keeps top offenses to under 90 points
neg,Neg,i would never have thought that this markkanen mobley allen front court would work but it s actually really hard to defend cavs so frisky this year
pos,Neg,jarrett allen is now 31 37 83 7 on the season from the floor with 17 ppg one of the best interior scorers in the league and a great switching defender him and mobley sharing the court can be the future
pos,Pos,cavs havent played defense like this in a loooong time
neg,Neg,bro jarrett allen is unreal
pos,Pos,damn all 30 of us cavs fans are really in here rn
pos,Neg,i m just happy this guarantees we won t go 0 4 on this rough west coast stretch
pos,Pos,great win for us allen and love played so well
pos,Pos,what a fun little game cavs can seriously play some fun basketball with the 4 big boys lauri allen love and mobley and just outsize the opponents on a side note it s sometimes frustrating watch the joker play i know he wants to play good team basketball and involve everyone but dude joker you are like one of the most efficient high volume scorers alongside steph and kd just shoot and look to score especially when you are shooting at 60 percent while everyone else you are playing with is sub 35 percent
pos,Pos,we were dead in the water when lauri kill jok gg cavs
neg,Neg,was kevin love trying to pull a blake griffin i didn t think he could be a productive player on an nba team anymore great game out of the cavs
pos,Pos,chippy but fun game rubio mobley allen and love were my standouts on our side
pos,Pos,so the cavs are giving us a lesson on how to construct a team of long bois
pos,Neg,game was tied 70 70 and cavs went on a 19 3 run absolutely earned this one
neg,Pos,we have reached the spooky phase of our post lebron rebuild also the news of kevin love s demise was greatly exaggerated
pos,Pos,what the stats don t show the cavs new found grit not rolling over under challenge but pushing through i think a lot of this comes from rubio they played physical and with consistent effort awesome to see
neg,Pos,love with the 22 off the bench was clutch also rubio 3 tall bois on the court is must watch basketball
pos,Pos,mobley shut down several possessional on his own okoro too also how about klove
pos,Neg,cavs are officially spooky
pos,Neg,as we all predicted
pos,Pos,love redemption arc
pos,Neg,i have no idea what to expect in this league anymore
neg,Neg,oh thank god it wasn t just us
pos,Pos,allen was an overpay
pos,Pos,markkanen and rubio might not look like much but cavs seem to be doing quite well with all the new faces allen mobley and markkanen big ball works quite well the defense hasnt been this good in years
pos,Neg,no team should write off cleveland they have a young core that can get buckets and a stalwart rim defender in jarrett allen wouldn t be surprised if they make the play in this year
neg,Neg,that makes sense go cavs
pos,Pos,game was over after the first bucket if we re being honest
pos,Pos,kevin love just dropped his old man dick on the nuggets forehead also jarrett allen with a casual 21 and 16
pos,Pos,the east runs thru cleveland
pos,Pos,cavs playing lauri mobley and allen on the floor together in recent games actually kinda work
pos,Pos,god bless this teams and their affinity for monster dunks also shout out to mobley for making a lineup with no forwards defensively viable
pos,Pos,cavs are better than people think
pos,Pos,mobley s stats don t look like anything but game high 16 just saying
neg,Neg,never thought a jokic run offense could look so inept now on to utah tomorrow rip
pos,Pos,turnovers killed us tonight but you don t get those turnovers without cavs playing good defense and pressuring guys into those mistakes i thought both teams were playing pretty good defense for most of the game but i d hope that when our offense is clicking better we can muster more than 87 points against any caliber defense in the nba was at the game got to see bones debut and that was worth the price of admission can t wait to see more of him this year he looks so comfortable even when put in bad situations makes me wish he had gotten to play in the ncaa tournament his second year i could have seen him and vcu making a run and getting some attention but i m glad he didn t because we wouldn t have been able to get him probably bones is a hooper he s gonna be a fan favorite for sure
pos,Pos,not overhyping or anything but love is now mentally healthy league is fucked
pos,Neg,that was a classic ricky rubio can t make a shot but still really effective game and also a classic ricky rubio get flagrant fouled to rally your team game he sure does draw a lot of those for a guard that doesn t jump
neg,Pos,thats my 6th man
pos,Neg,well i guess complaining to malone worked and they are taking the ball out of jokic s hands a lot more
neg,Neg,the cavs have some defensive pieces that are going to be hell for teams to deal with between okoro mobley and allen
pos,Pos,kevin love engaged like this is one of the better bench guys in the league but still a massive over pay the other very encouraging sign is that the last 2 wins the cavs don t need and don t just stand around waiting for sexy to score other guys are looking for shots and the ball is moving
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,bones was our 2nd 3rd best player tonight was on the floor for a bit in the second quater and in garbage but looked a hell of a lot better than half our lineup
pos,Neg,the cavs really had control of this game from start to finish they kept a safe lead the entire game and whenever denver looked like they were about to catch up the cavs pushed on
pos,Pos,kevin love 22 points off the bench entire nuggets bench 24 points
pos,Pos,lets goooooo
pos,Neg,love turning back the clock you love to see it
pos,Pos,it s on sight with markkanen from now on jk it just felt so wrong seeing jok getting posterized can i get that erased from my brain eternal sunshine of the spotless mind style
pos,Pos,well that was our worst game of the season please let it stay that way
pos,Pos,is it possible that cleveland is playing with so much length on the floor that opposing guards are having a damn hard time getting quality shots off because denver s guards did nothing and jokovic had less than half is normal assists i was assuming that putting lauri in as the sf would doom their defense instead maybe the entire front court just links arms and dares you to try to break through like in red rover
pos,Pos,that s probably the worst i ve seen the nuggs play in a few years gg cleveland you beat us fair and square on to the next one
neg,Neg,anyone that thinks that the nuggets are fine without murray need to watch this game
neg,Pos,mpj really is struggling to be consistent jokic was kinda col for a quarter but still put quite a performance rest of our team sucked fucking ass
pos,Pos,this cavs team might actually be scary if their defense is legit and love can play more like this
neg,Pos,my assessment that was certainly a basketball game played on monday october 25th 2021 in denver colorado
neg,Pos,looks like the goon squad gave kevin love his hops back ngl if they keep this momentum going i can totally see them creeping into the play in tournament
pos,Pos,mpj getting the max but not aston is something i will never understand
pos,Pos,the east is tougher than the west this year
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,is this what they are going to do lose to mediocre teams and beat elite teams
neg,Neg,as a jokic stan i m going to overreact and ask that jok be traded to the warriors to play with steph
neg,Neg,we own denver
neg,Pos,man pull out all of the advanced stats you want jokic just looks like an awful interior defender when you watch him on the court guys just go through him like he isn t there cement feet
neg,Pos,no such thing as an 0 82 team
neg,Neg,mpj needs to do better or shoot less
pos,Pos,anyone still think mobley and allen would be a disaster together
pos,Pos,sexland and love
neg,Pos,well at least bones got minutes in the plus didn t watch this just checking out box score
pos,Pos,jokíc with the casual 19 rebounds
pos,Pos,that s nice but markkanen dunked on jokic
pos,Pos,this is bad result for utah denver will come out to play super motivated
pos,Neg,damn that s sad
pos,Pos,mpj with another master class performance 4 14
neg,Pos,well well look at the cavs beating both the hawks and the nuggets if this was the ncaa they would be in the top25 for sure
pos,Neg,jarret allen is such an underrated center
neg,Pos,170 million man mr anti vaxx mr raw vegan mr brokeback oof
pos,Pos,the east runs through cleveland and cleaveland runs the east
neg,Pos,i wish mobley could tuck me in at night his defensive presence is so soothing
neg,Pos,wonder how long before love decides he d rather chill and do other things and benches himself
pos,Pos,mpj averaging a whopping 11 points so far this sub told me he was already a superstar lmao
neg,Neg,such an overrated team nuggets are
neg,Pos,how
pos,Pos,blazers had 30 turnovers i repeat 30 turnovers
pos,Pos,i swear the clips have been a horrible matchup for the blazers for the last couple seasons
pos,Pos,obligatory blow it up comments in 3 2 1
neg,Neg,0 2 powers have activated
neg,Pos,if hartenstein ever tones down on his fouling he ll be a monster
neg,Neg,i ain t buying too much into this since both teams were without their best players would ve been a much better game if we had dame and they had kawhi
pos,Pos,0 2 clippers are merciless
pos,Pos,for some reason dame sucks against clippers but this was different dude just stopped caring paul hamburglar george with 8 steals
pos,Pos,dame s been really rough so far this season
pos,Pos,36 assists on 43 made baskets inject that shit directly into my veins also i think one of the best things ty lue has done for our team was yank luke everytime he was passive now dude is insanely aggressive looks like he wants to put it up whenever the ball is in his hand and it s working edit 37 of 44 actually my bad
pos,Pos,we are somehow passing more than ever before but now with less assists and more turnovers 31st ranked ball movement in the league
pos,Pos,dame casually shooting 8 33 from 3 this season
pos,Pos,first of many when the clippers get the w i get a little chubby dude
pos,Pos,tied both the second and fourth quarters at 25 25 each interesting quirk in the box score
pos,Pos,i ve watched a lot of blazers basketball but i can pretty easily say that was dame s worst game shooting was off poor passes decision making leading to turnovers and no contribution on defense honestly the same could be said about nurk and roco but them performing poorly isn t nearly as shocking i really hope this funk ends soon
pos,Pos,terry stotts
pos,Pos,my heart grows bigger for hartenstein every night
pos,Pos,didn t expect to see the blazers bench play the 4th qtr again
neg,Neg,cj can t hang with these cats
neg,Pos,at a few points in the 4th the blazers had as many tos as fgs made they spent most of the 2nd half toe ing that line that is woof just woof almost 50 combined tos between these teams tonight just really ugly game all around
pos,Pos,no small feat blowing out a team with a top 75 player on its roster
pos,Pos,8 stls is mvpg season
neg,Pos,0 2 clippers vs 8 0 suns when an unmovable object meets an unstoppable force
pos,Pos,how does a man even get 8 steals lol let s go pg
pos,Pos,clippers defense the turnover machine blazers defense the layup machine
pos,Pos,put some respect on us we just triple h sledgehammer them tonight
pos,Pos,anyone notice that clippers routinely own the trailblazers
pos,Pos,beside the efficiency this game paul george has been playing like a top ten player this season so far
pos,Pos,8 steals is crazy
pos,Pos,the funny thing is we also shot like shit tonight this could of been worse
neg,Pos,dame feasting tonight 4 15 0 8 3 pointers you miss one hundred percent of the shots you don t take michael scott 3 airballs 4 turnovers
neg,Neg,pg dominating lame time my favorite clipper tradition
pos,Pos,prettyboy p lame time
pos,Pos,lawhi kennard for the win
neg,Pos,a scrub is a guy that can get love from me
pos,Pos,jay ain t no scrubb
pos,Pos,thank you to the nba for letting us get in our annual curb stomping of the blazers early on after the 0 2 start of the year
neg,Neg,dame washed
pos,Pos,all that talk about dame being better than pg needs to be put to rest once and for all it s not even close anymore
pos,Pos,blazers need to blow it up another first round exit you d get a monster haul of young players and picks for cj and dame hopefully you could find someone desperate to bite on a covington for 2 firsts trade for the 20th time
neg,Pos,lamian dillard
pos,Pos,i am worried that the blazers have yet to hold a team under 100 points even the freaking kings
pos,Pos,seems like since the 2019 series pg is angry everytime he plays dame and the blazers
neg,Pos,cannot believe they re running it back with these 3 again when will they learn the definition of insanity
neg,Neg,is this the guy in top 75
pos,Pos,0 2 clippers are unstoppable crown them champs already fools
pos,Pos,i m solely in this thread to see reggie jackson s box score he was a sniper in the playoffs but has been ass recently
pos,Pos,blazers defense be like
neg,Neg,god terry stotts is such a bad coach wait he s gone and replaced with a defensive minded coach god nurkic is so bad wait he s always been a slow big that makes the same exact pass every time god dame needs help he s carrying the whole team wait he s been bad since the olympics and has been horrible from 3 since his return it s always excuses with the blazer fanbase
pos,Pos,if these fools hadn t tanked at the end of last season they would ve gotten the blazers in the first round they probably sweep them and kawhi most likely doesn t get injured
pos,Pos,chauncey billups offensive system seems to be create no spacing throw cross court passes into clogged lanes and get the ball in the hands of your least athletic players i like originality in scheme so this could be a cool year to watch the blazers
neg,Pos,it s only been a handful of games but we re coming for that most inconsistent team in the league title yeaa
pos,Pos,dame 0 8 from 3 rip
pos,Pos,dame plays like a star against the lakers but against the clippers he loses his power
pos,Pos,15 assist total with 30 turnovers that is absolutely wild as hell maybe blazers are hoping they land chet and pablo next year
pos,Pos,what if dame told the blazers behind closed doors to trade him to the 76ers and if they dont he plays like trash
pos,Pos,kennard gotta earn that 64m contract
pos,Pos,ben simmons laughs in 14 0
pos,Pos,kemba and fournier top two scorers things you love to see
pos,Pos,still can t believe we can sink 3 s now
pos,Pos,a beautiful defensive effort against embiid all night couldn t ask for anything more from a thibs led team
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,knicks vs bulls on thursday will be must watch
pos,Neg,we finally beat the sixers
neg,Pos,whichever writer thought making the knicks good was a good idea you can stop now they re becoming scary
pos,Pos,i m just here for the bing bong comments
pos,Pos,and let that be a lesson to you all nobody beats the knicks 16 times in a row
pos,Pos,we had de blasio
neg,Neg,knicks have some 04 pistons energy
pos,Neg,the fuck is that deep team no one above 20 but all contributing offensively
pos,Neg,can t lose to the knicks if you don t play
neg,Pos,i fucking love this team obi toppin is so fucking good cardiac kemba fuck yes
pos,Pos,can i get a bing bong yerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
pos,Pos,lose to the magic blow out the sixers just knicks things
pos,Pos,dear sir or madam
neg,Pos,yo i got a question for you kd dont you regret not coming to the kniiiicks
pos,Pos,combining rose kemba minutes to form a starting pg might a top 5 pg in the league lol
pos,Pos,y all gon be hearing about mitchell robinson for dpoy this year a lot of it is gonna be from me whether he deserves it or not but still
pos,Pos,bong
pos,Pos,you just got outcoached by tom thibodeau
neg,Pos,go new york go new york go
pos,Pos,hey kd don t you regret not coming to the knickssssss
pos,Pos,we played crazy defense on embiid that was impressive thank god i can stop seeing that stupid ass streak stat
pos,Pos,embiid need to be on a team with a pg like the knicks
pos,Pos,gg knicks very well played a welcome pivot to being more willing 3pt shooters fournier off ball is a god send and kemba in a small role taking off the dribble 3s is definitely the optimum way to use him defence has always been there but hopefully can maintain this 3pt rage
pos,Pos,damn it feels nice to be on the other end of one of those ass whoopings once in a while
neg,Pos,where is that bum minnesota fan who said a thibs team could never shoot 3s u bozo
neg,Pos,as an aussie that bought a new york knicks jumper and now act like i barrack for them i am so bloody proud
pos,Pos,losing streak against the sixers broken thibs continues to turn the knicks around just need to close 4th quarters out better and not relax if they have a lead and they will continue to be a dangerous team in the east
pos,Pos,props to the knicks that is all
pos,Pos,it s been awhile since bulls knicks is good television but we are here can t wait
pos,Pos,let it be known no one beats the knicks except for us
neg,Neg,knicks are here baby knicks are here
neg,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,stop being a bitch tnt and show the bulls vs knicks on thursday
neg,Pos,we finally beat them holy fuck
pos,Pos,love to see d rose winning he doesn t get a lot of attention these days but damn he plays such smooth and efficient basketball
pos,Pos,yeerrrrrrrrrrrrrr
pos,Pos,i m not going to overreact until the knicks beat a real nba team
neg,Pos,walker s demise was greatly exaggerated tell the east to look up cause that s where you ll find us
pos,Pos,embid looking cooked at the moment
pos,Pos,we want bama da bulls
neg,Neg,people sleeping on knicks bulls and hornets for some serious deep playoff runs celtics sixers heat all kind of suspect still imo
neg,Neg,bing bong sends its regards
pos,Pos,embiid looked really out of shape
pos,Pos,kembaaaa
pos,Pos,good to see randle trust in his teammates he seems to have developed nice chemistry with both fournier and kemba early in the season hopefully randle understands that for the knicks to become contenders he has to enable the rest of his teammates to be threats and tonight the knicks showed that they have weapons both playmakers and finishers up and down the roster
pos,Pos,knicks looking good this year they definitely will make some noise this playoffs
pos,Pos,76ers without simmons magic sixers fans who thought they d be better without ben bc of team chemistry
neg,Neg,bing bong
neg,Pos,bong
pos,Pos,love seeing drose win
pos,Pos,knicks impressed sixers aren t getting out of the 2nd round unless they trade ben for an upgrade
pos,Pos,ben simmons still undefeated against the knicks and kemba
pos,Pos,what a game evan and kemba
pos,Pos,let that be a lesson to you no one beats the new york knickerbockers 16 games in a row
pos,Pos,go new york go new york go go new york go
neg,Pos,y all need ben simmons to beat us
pos,Pos,i love watching the knicks such a solid team
pos,Pos,as a bulls fan i m not concerned with these lowly teams with one or more loses at least this week
pos,Neg,trouble in paradise for philly rn
neg,Pos,good game you guys blasted us
pos,Pos,now i get why ben simmons doesnt want to play he wants embiid doc and the sixers exposed he really is jimmy butler in that he is needed
pos,Pos,been waiting since 2017 to say this dilly dilly fck philly
neg,Neg,sixers look so uncomfortable as a team they are finna turn on the front office if they don t get some help soon now that simmons has got his money back he needs to turn up the flames and really test moreys mettle make no mistake there s value out there that can easily help this team that isn t necessarily an allstar right now
neg,Neg,wish thibs would start subbing guys out with 1 30 left
pos,Pos,embiid would be a lot better if he wasn t so concerned with flopping and flailing trying to throw himself on the floor and his limbs all over the place use your size bruh why you trying to draw fouls on jump shots and make all your points at the line waste of size to earn your keep at the stripe at 7 and 300lb he had one dunk where he just attacked and it was unstoppable he needs more of that
neg,Pos,look at me this is our division
neg,Neg,chuck was right again
pos,Pos,bbq chickens where good d from mitch 2nite
pos,Neg,ahem bing bong
pos,Pos,your team just lost to tom thibodeau
pos,Pos,yerrrick rose
pos,Pos,where s ben simmons
pos,Pos,bing bong from out west yerrrrrr
pos,Pos,b i n g b o n g
pos,Pos,harris is the biggest empty calorie stat player of all time him and embiid can t play winning basketball together
pos,Pos,who was that dipshit trying to go for the ball when it was the final possession
neg,Neg,philly keeps wasting embiids prime he needs a pg he cant handle the ball so much
pos,Pos,bing
pos,Neg,how did seth look so trash
pos,Pos,dear sir or madam
pos,Pos,outta the loop why s bing bong replacing yerrrr
pos,Pos,bad game from philly joel couldn t buy a bucket same story as last year 76ers offensive will live and die through joel
pos,Pos,sixers fans tell me how this was ben simmons fault
neg,Pos,i don t like ben simmons
pos,Neg,you just lost to the lolknicks
neg,Neg,ben simmons is still 14 0 against kemba and nyk that will never die
pos,Pos,thank you bucks for breaking the barkley guarantee curse
pos,Pos,b
pos,Pos,is this ben simmons fault too
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,floor spacing for the knicks was so needed this year now guys can operate a bit better knowing defensively guys have to stay home a little more
pos,Pos,hurts to see the ex celtics tear it up but i m proud of my dudes
pos,Pos,76ers tried hard in the end for a comeback
pos,Pos,fournier is looking like atlanta kyle korver at times his performance this game and against the celtics holy crap as a celtics fan when he came off the screen to catch and shoot i would just say this shit is going in in it went no rim sound just net such a pure stroke
pos,Pos,let s go knicks
pos,Pos,can we throw respect on his name thibs is a seriously good coach i have a question for wolves fans would you rather thibs or kat
pos,Pos,whatever they ve only played trash teams like the lakers and clips
neg,Pos,what do you know about damion leelard
neg,Neg,looks like wiggins 5g reception is finally starting to radiate from his body bill gates is smiling from above somewhere
neg,Neg,damn oubre was really bad for us last year
pos,Pos,dread it run from it 3rd quarter gsw arrives all the same
pos,Pos,i didn t expect our bench to be this good strength in numbers is back
neg,Pos,it must be exhausting getting double and triple teamed as much as steph does but you can t argue with it that much when you cover him 1 on 1 you get what happened in the 1st quarter vs the clips dort also did a good job
pos,Pos,wiggins with a chip on his shoulder is looking really nice for us
pos,Pos,wwwwarriors
neg,Pos,jta is so fucking good really happy with the way he s developing also dort is a monster
neg,Pos,0 82 is still in the menu boys
pos,Pos,classic death by 3rd quarter performance by warriors
pos,Pos,that game took 2 hrs 15 min lol gotta love it
pos,Pos,did the warriors even win 4 games in a row last season
pos,Pos,this is a game where both teams won
pos,Neg,death taxes and the 3rd quarter warriors
pos,Neg,steph was getting doubled the entire game lol
pos,Pos,wwwwiggins
pos,Pos,of course the warriors would start the season with a california sweep and beating down okc as usual sga is a beast btw
pos,Pos,every warriors game has been tight they would have lost all four of these last year
pos,Neg,okc was genuinely great tonight credit where it s due probably the best defensive team the warriors have seen so far this season i really really want to see okc face off against the lakers now
neg,Neg,wiggin s playmaking and aggressiveness in the fourth kept this game away from okc that being said otto porter jr s two clutch 3s in the third was silky smooth goddamn
pos,Pos,the commentators calling him gary payton 2 fucking killed me
pos,Pos,random thoughts thunder starters are solid shai dort giddey bazeley random c is solid starting 5 certainly better than their record indicates really like the thunder s offensive sets should run more of them creates lots of good looks for the players they don t always knock them down but good looks nonetheless shai gotta work on fouling less needs to realize he s the most important player on the court for okc let some buckets go so you can play more aggressive in crunch time seriously shai is so damn good giddey s has off the charts bbiq and passing ability for his age if he ever develops a consistent off the dribble jumpshot league fucked okc did a really good job of slowing the game down making it more half court to half court more up tempo favors the warriors as seen by the end of the 3rd quarter okc has a ton of guys who can handle the ball makes them a pain to defend if you have a shot blocking c bazeley needs to realize he s a role player and not a star takes too many bad shots wastes too many posessions dort s defense is porn like god he s so fucking good at defense its ridiculous man should be 1st team this year if he s healthy rest of okc s defense though is not good but that s too be expected of a young team okc just kinda ran out of gas always through the 3rd q played 2 5 quarters of great basketball but couldn t keep executing at such a high level for the remaining 1 5 q s warriors sleepwalking through another game against weaker competition a concerning trend early in the season i don t like jp in the starting lineup makes it too hard for him and steph to get into rhythm since they both want the ball in their hands too many cooks in the kitchen scenario would rather dlee start over him and move jp back into the 6th man role i also don t think looney should start every game especially against the thunder going super small i d rather see opj jta or dray start at the 5 warriors gang rebounding is impressive but it does hurt their ability to get out on the break stop overcommitting on three point shooters especially against a team that isnt great at hitting them gave away wayyyyyyy too many free buckets to okc cuz of over rotations by warriors defenders dlee is the warriors mvp tonight consistent shooting shockingly good d great offball movement etc best player not named steph tonight for the warriors wiggins came alive in the 2nd half buoyed the warriors offense for the first 2 3rds of the 3rd q took the warriors way too long to realize they can attack the paint with impunity against this small okc team loved the 3rd quarter closing lineup steph lee jta dray opj is a nasty lineup sidetone good things happen when jta s in really shut down the thunders drive game kerr s adjustments won them this game experimented around until he found the right lineup lineups and made lots of smart tinkers in the 4th q like taking poole out so quickly after subbing steph back in really damn good coach also this warriors team is stupid deep lol
pos,Pos,jordan poole was cold today but glad dlee bailed us out
pos,Pos,is it time to bring it back
pos,Pos,warriors getting comfortable wins without constant steph bailouts is an amazing development this season
neg,Pos,your star gets the stats you make it seem close at first then throw good job okc the perfect loss
pos,Pos,they had us in the first half not gonna lie
pos,Pos,yah this unit is gonna be special steph doesn t just have help he has a team that 2nd unit w ig jta and auto needs a nickname
pos,Pos,24 0 still in play
neg,Neg,shai is like if kd and pg had a child together
neg,Neg,3rd quarter warriors showed up okc scary
pos,Pos,solid win after an atrocious first half from the warriors
pos,Pos,time for everyone to remember that a double digit lead going into the half against gsw really means you re down like 7 points
pos,Pos,3rd quarter warriors is back on the menu
pos,Pos,yeah fuck off win by 0 5 below the handicap
neg,Pos,sga had a very good game though the decision to make wiggins post him when he had 5 fouls is probably why we won the game
pos,Pos,wiggins won the game for us in the 4th with clutch kickouts and just scoring over his quota of 17 love it
pos,Pos,i know klay was the snub or the 75 year team but should it have been draymond warriors now 19 5 in last 24 regular season games steph and dray really an all time duo
pos,Neg,this feels like a game the warriors would have lost last year
pos,Pos,the team playing half asleep really made wiggins mad enough to dunk
pos,Pos,21 to go
pos,Pos,i bet a sizable for me amount of money on warriors 8 5 ama
pos,Pos,warriors are fun again bruh
pos,Pos,curry is the waitress and dort is charlie lmao he just wouldn t leave curry alone
pos,Pos,this warriors team reloaded and nobody fucking noticed
pos,Pos,say whatever you want about this team but if andrew wiggans can be a dominate force then you add klay top 77 all time player well that s a team that can win a championship i think just having draymond become more argressive on offensive is more the key past 2 4 years he become stagnant with kd can t blame him tho
pos,Pos,sga going to lead the league in scoring at some point in the future
neg,Pos,wiggins is so important to this team can get points when needed shut down the best player defensively create for others
neg,Neg,this was a basketball game i think so no take backs on our win
pos,Pos,dort ate curry but he adapted really bad shooting in 1st half and pretty good in 2nd
pos,Pos,wwwwarriors
pos,Pos,okc also continuing their defeated run
neg,Pos,who the fuck is aaron wiggins
pos,Pos,man if okc is the worst team in the league this is gonna be a hell of a year
pos,Pos,these guys are pretty good
neg,Neg,a friendly reminder this team is doing it without klay and kd needed both to win
pos,Pos,wiggs hates okc fr
neg,Neg,it s refreshing to see steph get double and triple teamed all night and the team rise to the challenge around it let s go boys put the league on notice
neg,Pos,and of course the spread was nine sigh
pos,Neg,i am gonna overreact and say we are going 98 0 this season
pos,Pos,shout out moses moody with the 46 seconds
pos,Pos,3rd quarter warriors combined with coach marks experimental lineups
neg,Neg,okc rocking 3 27 record in the last 30 games they are chasing the bobcats 2011 marvelous season record
neg,Pos,wwwwarriors
pos,Pos,3rd quarter warriors continue to show out
neg,Neg,imagine steph carrying this team every fucking game wow
neg,Neg,it felt like okc couldn t miss a three pointer or a jumper that first quarter they also sliced up our inside defense that first half need to tighten that up for next game
pos,Neg,30 assists on 39 makes for the warriors love that
pos,Neg,dubs in one
pos,Neg,this ain t even their final form imahine when kla6 gets back and the team gels
pos,Neg,wiggins playmaking finally happening steph still in offseason mode he ll heat up eventually poole is there but will need to up his shooting a little bit d lee is the early hero for us this season makes the righ plays and shoots the ball when we need him to jta getting some threes please don t settle for a draymond type of passiveness shoot it bro
pos,Pos,the hell did you do okc to wiggins to make him hate you so much
pos,Neg,didn t catch the game but watching highlights make me hyped about opj is he the best value signing as the highlights make it look also troubling that the warriors keep starting slow but i guess on the road and still some unproven guys outside steph dray looney hopefully they pick up better habits soon
pos,Pos,okc wiggins
pos,Pos,wiggins vs okc mj tbh
neg,Pos,zach lowe idk if the thunder are a 9 73 team but they re flirting with it they re like sending an inappropriate text to the 9 73 teams
pos,Pos,golden state vs chicago bulls finals
pos,Pos,this giddey guy is some ass
pos,Pos,undefeated run it s been 4 games
pos,Pos,shai was cooking and curry was super passive but lee and wiggs really carried that 2nd half
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,steph s got help this season and he s got klay and wiseman waiting in the wings alongside the rooks are just getting to soak in everything and develop instead getting pushed into the fire early dubs are gonna be legit again this season
pos,Pos,why does every opposing commentator hate the thunder
neg,Neg,is there any shot sga tries to force a trade i know he just signed his max deal but contracts don t seem to matter in the nba anymore i would imagine at some point it would seem like he s just wasting his time on the thunder
neg,Neg,24 0
pos,Pos,the wwwwarriors are back baby
pos,Pos,they are looking good lol
pos,Pos,thread title makes it sound like a playoff sweep
neg,Neg,durant defeating westbrook agai wait
pos,Neg,giddey was cooked on defense
pos,Pos,and we may never lose again
neg,Neg,i watched most of the game few takeaways okc moves the ball so well except for bazley less sharing when he is on the floor okc needs a rolling big on the second unit someone like moses brown then you can let poku cook in the p n r okc color guy can t pronounce bjelica s name and said that dribbling and kicking out is not his game what
neg,Pos,are we getting back 3rd quarter ptsd warriors again
pos,Pos,we re not even in our final form
pos,Pos,who ll be the first one to get a dub okc or pistons
pos,Pos,who we shmokin on
pos,Pos,82 0 season inc
neg,Neg,the spurs and lakers still somehow have undefeated games
pos,Pos,we need to make our free throws lmao
neg,Pos,hit your freethrows kids
pos,Pos,why lonnie didn t get a shot in ot is a crime
pos,Pos,jakob has really started just dunking it now before he used to go for those stupid floaters too often
neg,Pos,dejounte murray is a monster
pos,Pos,austin reeves
pos,Pos,i finally understand why the spurs traded kawhi for poeltl
pos,Pos,russell westbrook best game in a lakers uniform but that one guy who keeps posting westbrook negative stat posts russell westbrook 40 minutes 3 turnovers 5 fouls 1
pos,Pos,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray triple double for my boy
pos,Pos,poeltl got that extra l to his surname and tried to handle it to us good fucking game
pos,Pos,monk being 31 in 39 mins while other starters don t break 10 is hilariously weird
pos,Pos,poeltl is a monster
pos,Pos,well that hurt fuck you lakers but gg
pos,Pos,when westbrook decides to attack like that it s really unstoppable
pos,Neg,the amount of laker fans in san antonio nauseated me
neg,Neg,the spurs really didn t wanna win this game
pos,Pos,great win we didn t quit and kept the intensity positives russell westbrook 33 10 8 and anthony davis 35 and 17 had big games r westbrook especially made a couple of important baskets down the stretch malik monk was solid also we didn t give up mentally overall down the stretch negatives we have clear defensive issues we were making jakob peotl look like the second coming of george mikan out there it was ridiculous we gotta defend the pick and roll a bit better also we need to do a better job rebounding we need to go back to the fundamental point of boxing out we have been giving up too many offensive rebounds which lead to second chance points 16 to 9 for sas today and with the size we have we have no excuses for this to happen finally we struggled from 3 26 lebron has been our best shooter from 3 and his absence was felt in this area today
neg,Pos,westbrook demise has been greatly exaggerated
pos,Pos,this team atm will handle being without lebron better than previous lebron teams but with lebron will not be as good as previous lebron teams such a weird ass team
pos,Neg,that was an awesome game our team is so fun and tough minded just got beaten out by talent and all those missed free throws do you ask serious questions about the fit with lebron and russ after this first handful of games russ was amazing tonight and he needs the ball
neg,Neg,hard to believe that this was a san antonio home game with all those boos
pos,Pos,russell westbrook had 33 10 8 and people in the lakers sub were still shitting on him and calling him westbrick sometimes i am embarassed to be associated with other laker fans
pos,Neg,phew luckily the tank rolls on still wet for chet we fucking had them dammit
pos,Pos,man that game was fun poetl is a beast lakers defensive rotations in q3 were awful spurs were cooking them putting in dwight was the right move pulled the defense back together hope ad is ok
neg,Neg,nice to not be the worst shooting free throw team for one game
pos,Pos,i feel like pop doesn t call timeouts at the end of games anymore just so the game ends quicker how does he not call one on either of those possessions at the end
pos,Pos,ad is a monster
pos,Pos,ad with the acl tear followed by the alley oop just a normal lakers game
pos,Pos,literally just make free throws
pos,Pos,love the thread spam about russ performance lol
pos,Pos,took 10 years off my life watching the spurs miss critical fts
pos,Pos,espn tomorrow is lebron holding westbrook back
pos,Pos,hope ad is ok
pos,Pos,we saw that we were winning and realized that hurts the chances of obtaining chet
pos,Pos,russ haters are super quiet tonight lmaooo
neg,Pos,i knew all of those missed spurs free throws will haunt them back
pos,Pos,spurs need a go to guy they have some of the best wing defenders in the league but they were all getting beat off the dribble repeatedly in ot a true scorer is vital in winning these close games
pos,Pos,felt like the spurs lost it in the 4th more than anything else i was impressed but not surprised to see malik have the confidence to decisively launch that 30 footer with under a minute left loved his postgame comments too re every lakers game being a home game
neg,Pos,a tough game but westbrook had his best game so far as a laker and fortunately we had evil anthony davis on our side
neg,Neg,westbrook s death has been greatly exaggerated
pos,Pos,if you can t handle me at my westbrick you don t deserve me at my bestbrook
neg,Neg,fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
neg,Pos,are the lakers better without lebron james s
pos,Pos,poeltl missing those 4 free throws was crazy
pos,Pos,it was a bestbrook game
pos,Neg,let s go devin vassell looks like he s finally playing his way into extended minutes he s going to be a two way star
neg,Pos,the fact jakob poeltl was a 14 with that stat line is wild to me watching the game he looked so productive and unstoppable in the paint but i guess he was also out there when they were getting cooked
pos,Pos,damn
pos,Pos,good loss by our boys super winnable game if we made our fts shoutout jak tho
pos,Pos,i m a brodie stan and proud to be one
pos,Neg,good to see classic westbrook tonight i like this spurs team they probably wont win alot but they will be fun to watch
pos,Pos,you cannot stop poeltl you can only hope to contain him
neg,Pos,master class in tanking keep the other team on their toes then lose by a couple of possessions at the end 27 55 still in play
neg,Neg,now you guys see why we traded for russ lol if this was last year with bron sitting we definitely lose this game
pos,Pos,spurs ain t no hoes westbrook hooped
pos,Neg,spurs gifted that to them with all those missed free throws gotta seal the deal there
pos,Pos,now we finally know who is the problem in lakers lol
pos,Neg,this one hurts a lot
neg,Neg,the spurs need someone who can get get a bucket other than just spamming murray poeltl pnr nobody else could buy a bucket down the stretch also murray is a super underrated defender and playmaker
pos,Pos,lakers sportnet just put it perfectly do the lakers win that game with kcp kuz trez
pos,Pos,poeltl will appear in my nightmares
pos,Pos,lol the game threads are truly one of the best things in this sub the amount of overreactions and flip flopping when it comes to watching westbrook and evaluating westbrook play is truly hilarious coupled by the fact that it s the lakers you have yourself one shitshow of a discussion
neg,Pos,malik monk with the 31 lol
pos,Neg,why did lebron sit
neg,Neg,honestly can say this is the most amped i ve been for a regular season win in over a decade
neg,Pos,man i sure wish i could watch my favorite team play unfortunately i live to close and at the same time not close enough to them
pos,Pos,malik monk shot 6 of 15 and was a 31 what a wild stat line
pos,Pos,for three quarters i had ad slander in my head i was frustrated but that 4th quarter he was amazing and was a big reason behind the comeback credit to him also shout out to russ and monk who were fantastic
pos,Pos,the amount of disrespect and slander that westbrook has got since the start of the season has nauseating to say the least
pos,Neg,i would like 1 poeltl for my team please
pos,Pos,jakob has an argument to be the most underrated player in the league
pos,Pos,wb with 33
neg,Neg,malik monk with that casual 31 and that says a lot about the heavy use of that rondo west pairing when he wasn t on court
pos,Pos,lakers have some really unorganized defensive sets players are bumping into each other looking like wile e coyote doing some dumb shit
pos,Pos,this is why we got westbrook r nba
pos,Pos,fucking lakers plastics fans in the arena embarassing
pos,Pos,i miss bubble lakers with the easy wins this year is stress
pos,Pos,westbrooks uncalled flagrant 1 foul on keldon the play in question wtf was that ref looking at he didn t want to call another foul on a superstar player who had already had a high foul count fuck that guy
pos,Pos,this game was so fun to watch gg spurs y all probably deserved to win that
neg,Pos,shout out to undrafted rook reaves for playing so well tonight
pos,Pos,it sounded like a lakers home crowd
pos,Pos,wassup
pos,Pos,ad looked good out there cleaned up a lot
neg,Neg,played well without their third option
pos,Pos,spurs are allergic to making free throws
pos,Pos,i just want a w spurs doing amazing work just can t seal the deal in the 4th
pos,Pos,glad they got a win without lebron westbrook an ad did there thing malik is a keeper
pos,Pos,monk
pos,Pos,mr floor raiser strikes again
pos,Pos,u bscottyj someone has some congratulations to give
pos,Neg,we can now win games without lebron this is great
pos,Pos,the los angeles lakers are officially undefeated since their last losing streak
pos,Pos,sad spur noises
pos,Pos,so yeah the lakers are gonna be fine
pos,Pos,melo with 4 points in 30 minutes 1 7 0 4 that s bad
pos,Pos,say what you want about the lakers they re really fun to watch russ ad and lebron is gonna be a hell of a ride
pos,Pos,is it just a coincidence russ had his best game by far when lebron didn t play or is it just cause the offense was run though him like it used to be
pos,Pos,the lakers commentators are unwatchable they referred to derrick white as lonnie white lonnie walker as lonnie murray and drew eubanks as brett edit in watchable to unwatchable
pos,Pos,westbrook proved us all wrong tonight guys hahaha
neg,Pos,russ haters ghost tonight
pos,Pos,havent watched much of the lakers but austin reaves must have some good dirt on vogel to get these minutes as an undrafted rookie seems alright but felt like he played the whole damn game
pos,Pos,my heart can t take these close games
pos,Pos,i ve been to so so so many sports events in my whole life and that was probably the funnest one i ve been to not gonna lie
pos,Pos,westbrook s chill lebron i got this game
pos,Pos,look at this thread with one award lol westbrook haters are quiet af tonight
pos,Pos,wb was great but all this showed me was that lebron and him shouldn t be sharing the floor together if they can get wb to come off the bench and stagger lebron and him they could unlock some crazy shit
pos,Neg,i m so tired of watching dudes roll on the floor in agony and then stand up and continue playing it was so weird watching ad in pain and then the lakers literally draw up a lob to him the next play
neg,Neg,the lakers had another lucky night a win is a win but neither win of theirs has been definitive so far even against middle of the road teams lonnie walker had a hot hand for a while there but you have to give it up for poltl he kept the team in there with a bunch of nice rebounds and put backs in the fourth quarter the spurs have the 2nd worst free throw percentage in the league and you saw why here tonight there s just no excuse for not making those it s back to reality with carmelo he had a great night against memphis but 4 points in 28 minutes is not going to cut it i m not a fan of ad s shot selection at all it s not a new thing but he d have so many more points if he hung out in the paint instead of at mid range
pos,Pos,well at least we make the lakers think russell isn t going to completely fuck their season yes i m salty
neg,Pos,where is the malik monk deep three highlight
pos,Neg,shout out to the refs we thought they were fucking us over turns out they were helping us to not go 12 37 from the line
pos,Pos,damn this sub told me westbrook is a bum thats crazy
pos,Pos,road to champions 80 2
pos,Pos,ad made everyone his son
pos,Pos,lebron was holding back russ and ad confirmed
pos,Pos,defeat
neg,Pos,what a game from jakob
pos,Pos,give me the westbrook hate now i want to drink your fing tears
pos,Neg,where the westbrook haters at now
pos,Pos,no one cares about westbrook the story here is that we should be now calling it the poeltl trade
pos,Pos,wasn t able to watch the game anyone have a quick summary on what happened
neg,Neg,lakers 1 3 in my eyes didn t deserve to win this game
neg,Neg,this one decent russ game is going to prompt 5 terrible ones have fun with that la
pos,Pos,anyone who still thinks we should ve gotten hield instead of russ is just a big baby edit those downvoting just proving my point hahahahaha
pos,Pos,russ finally had a good game
neg,Neg,watched the 4th quarter and overtime both of these teams looked like shit
neg,Neg,lebenchwarmer
pos,Pos,lakers fans hyping for this win are cringe welldone you beat one of the worst 5 teams talent wise of the league same stands for russ fans who are saying he is back perfectly on the script of last 5 years of russ constantly playing great against bad competition like shitty teams or in february march when teams rest their players
pos,Pos,spurs fans tryna tell me we have a great young core yeah right our core is the most unclutch in the league we really are stuck in absolute purgatory shit sucks gg lakers
neg,Neg,lakers lick lawler s law lacking lebron
pos,Neg,mvp campaign
pos,Neg,trade lebron
pos,Pos,lakers trynna give me a heart attack
pos,Pos,lol
neg,Pos,why was bron looking annoyed at the end lol anyone else notice that
pos,Pos,my heart can t take back to back close games
neg,Neg,wtf did i just watch
pos,Pos,i like this russ
neg,Pos,we don t need lebron lol
pos,Neg,lakers gonna play their 2nd and 3rd stringers tomorrow to get a 30 point win
pos,Pos,let s hope we can see more bestbrook this early in the season
neg,Neg,why isn t thaddeus young playing
pos,Pos,the calls for reggie bullock were not exaggerated also more moses brown
neg,Pos,mavs played every single player on their roster
pos,Neg,thank you knicks for reggie bullock we re taking more of your players
pos,Neg,silas is handsome
pos,Pos,hey we re 1 3 not 1 4 yet
pos,Pos,we played everyone on the bench don t know what that means but we did it
pos,Pos,mavs are 2 1 good game nice to see bullock and moses
pos,Pos,reggie s gonna be a fan favorite love his play and seems awesome off the court too
pos,Pos,watch as luka shoots 30 from 3p in the regular season but 45 in thr playoffs
pos,Pos,law of lukavalent exchange perfect from the line struggles from three great from three struggles from the line still a baller regardless
neg,Pos,mavs fans may be mixed but given that you came in with a completely new fo and a historically not great coach by record standards i d say it s probably going better than it would for teams put in that position restructures typically kill any chance of a good start to a season
pos,Neg,free reggie
pos,Pos,here s your dallas mavs post game summary now in our 6th season 6 did the mavs win thank god we survived eric gordan kidd s 2nd win as the new mavs head coach luka again with a near triple double finishing with 26 14 7 2 steals he was able to sit a good chunk of the 2nd half thanks to the bench mob timmy wasn t as good as last game but still had a solid 16pts on solid shooting kp had a rough night with 9 3 in 19min had to sit with lower back tightness unfortunately hopefully it s nothing too serious bench analysis brunson burner with a double double off the bench with 11 11 for a career high in dimes reggie dude was the mvp of the bench mob with 16pts knocking down 4 3 s maxi got in on the bench mob with 9pts 7rebs all off of 3 s bobi was huge in the 1st half keeping us connected with some rebounds putbacks finished with 11pts in just 9min overall a solid win tonight with luka having some much needed help show up when he sat for a breather we got the spurs next on thursday
pos,Pos,kidd gave every single player on roster time tonite lol bullock looked phenomenal
pos,Pos,how tf 7 4 porzingis only gettin 4 bounds smfh
neg,Pos,kidd owes that reporter that asked about bullock s playing time an apology lol reggie showed exactly why he should be starting tonight
pos,Neg,mavs are 2 1
neg,Pos,kidd really experimented tonight never seen the whole roster randomly played like this
pos,Pos,buying the dip on porzingis for fantasy was in hindsight a bad move
pos,Pos,real questions to rockets fans how is that tate guy getting minutes over jaygup
pos,Pos,i m just gonna say it boban is a better offensive player than kp
pos,Pos,even my grandma got playing minutes for the mavs in this game
pos,Pos,i feel like every game this season has been fast paced but with tons of bricks even the high scoring games aren t great offense it s just shots being chucked up with like 18 left on the shot clock
pos,Pos,seems like we forgot how to shoot the ball in the off season thank god timmy and reggie are flamethrowers
neg,Neg,i m just glad this game is over
neg,Pos,give moses brown powell s minutes and start reggie please
pos,Pos,silas makes some weird decisions like not running through the offense through green but theis too many tos and i hope kp is ok
pos,Pos,gotta say not a fan of these lineups
pos,Pos,it s still very early this season but this makes porzingis a perfect 3 for 3 on taking more shots than he s scored points for the mavs so far this year i m pretty sure that s not a good thing
pos,Pos,rough night for everyone except gordon
neg,Neg,regardless of the win i m still not convinced we re a good team
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,mavs are 2 1
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,the mavs are done after losing their first game
pos,Pos,highlight of the game was the flop the rocket player did to draw a foul on luka in the backcourt 5 feet in front of the idiot ref
pos,Pos,alperen sengun is not an nba player
pos,Pos,for green i think there might be a steep learning curve as for efficiency he pretty much got the rim and scored at the rim whenever he wanted on ignite 73 at the rim but thus far he has struggled to finish 2 7 from two mostly due to strength also 0 fta through 4 games
pos,Pos,we just need to get better at hitting our shots and we ll be a dangerous team
pos,Pos,eric gordon auditioning for the mavericks so hard
pos,Pos,rockets looked like high school team out there havin 10 turnovers per minutes luckily for them the mavs wanted to have a kinda close game so they only shot 3s with one arm
pos,Pos,can anyone convince me not to drop porzingis in fantasy right now my whole roster is high risk high reward zion irving jalen green mpj kp but i just don t feel like dealing with this guy even when he s healthy he gets taken out of games too easily i see mobley rubio and adams as free agents
pos,Pos,we did it jokic the leading scorer despite only playing the 1st half
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,jokic with the game high 24 points as expected
pos,Pos,man these two teams have been treating every game like a playoff game lately i hate to see these bangs and bruises but it s entertaining
pos,Pos,hope jokic is okay mpj gotta get out of this funk
pos,Pos,as a nuggets fan i m just glad joker is supposedly okay we put up a fight even without our two best players so it is what it is
pos,Pos,broke donovan mitchell going 1 9 from 3 woke donovan mitchell going 8 11 from 2
pos,Pos,jokic top scorer w 15 minutes played
pos,Pos,serious question what is going on with michael porter jr i know it s only been four games but this is not the player we saw at the end of last season or even the player we saw in preseason
pos,Pos,jokic had a real nice stat line for playing only 15 minutes
pos,Pos,jokic is the only nba player i truly fear
pos,Pos,in the race of undefeated teams who ll last the longest bulls next 3 knicks utah boston away jazz next 3 rockets away bulls away bucks away warriors next 3 grizzlies okc hornets i hope bulls and jazz go undefeated into their next game
pos,Pos,i like hassan on our team
pos,Pos,really don t get how hassan whiteside got ejected all they did was push each other a couple times they hadn t even been fighting before that green likely got tossed because he grabbed a ref but whiteside makes no sense
pos,Pos,not a bad l sans jok and murray on a b2b we will get you next time jazz
pos,Pos,this jazz team is deep as hell man
pos,Pos,well that was a basketball game
pos,Pos,really weird game that we can t take much away from bc of the jokic injury donovan and mpj played terrible jazz bench saved the day odd double t plus ejection for god knows what reason nice to win i guess
pos,Neg,rudulph go beer
pos,Pos,is it just me or has gobert been scoring way more so far
pos,Pos,look forward to a healthy joker when i go to see these guys in denver in january love this teams mentality whiteside looks bought in paschall looks bought in looking forward to being gay for gay
pos,Pos,whiteside is doing really well in our system
pos,Neg,all that really matters is that jokic is okay and i m happy morris is finding his legs that said i cannot imagine a more disappointing start to the season for mpj it s been clear since the beginning of last season that he needed to work on his handle if he was gonna be more than a spot up shooter mares has been harping out it forever and if we see it than the coaches see it which means there is 0 excuses for the lack of improvement he literally couldn t even dribble past lauri last night not good kenny is talking about it as i type michael is a finisher not a creator right now you don t pay somebody a max to be a finisher especially when they are flawed on d that said i don t buy that he is tuned out his d was solid for most of the night lots of hustle plays and his passing has been a lot better granted the bar started on the floor also malone is gonna escape heat because of the jokic injury but his flaws as a coach are rearing their head again the offense makes no room for mpj to find shots in rhythm with jokic and looks completely rudderless without him meanwhile he continues to trot out that god awful 5 man lineup and leave bones who might already be the 3rd best shot creator on the team on the bench lastly let barton be okay it s been so much fun watching his resurgence
pos,Pos,how was jokic the top scorer in this game lmao
pos,Pos,sucks jokic was out but it was nice seeing rudy punish small ball 23 and 16 is big
pos,Pos,nikola exited the game with 2 minutes left in the 2nd quarter as the game high scorer with 24 nikola jokic did not return and finished the game as the game high scorer with 24
pos,Pos,jokic is good at basketball wcf match up plz and ty
pos,Pos,ngl if jokic and murray didn t play in the bubble the jazz woulda won
pos,Pos,you could put 5 redditors in nuggets jerseys and the jazz would still keep it close
pos,Pos,clarkson has 6moy locked up already and gobert has to fight voter fatigue but there s no one on his level of defense
pos,Pos,mpj has been awful to start the season not fitting in as the second option so far second thing hope jokic is okay and it s nothing serious
pos,Pos,no jokic or murray and the jazz have a chance against the nuggets
neg,Pos,jazz silently undefeated
neg,Pos,mpj after max deal booty
neg,Neg,jalen brown is who michael porter thinks he is
pos,Pos,nevalost
pos,Pos,was mpj just running around out there
pos,Pos,wait so jokic is down and the nuggets fucking suck without him checks out most points and assists on his team with 15 minutes of play bench scored 15 points i hope jokic is ok
pos,Neg,mpj is just not good as a first option at all
neg,Pos,damn jokic dominated nuggets had this if he didn t got injured
pos,Pos,mpj got the chance to show what he can do as the focal point of the offense no jokic or jamal didn t really go that well
pos,Pos,this is like when the irish won but krum caught the snitch
pos,Pos,nuggs fans whats up with gordon what s his role on your team he has 20 points but it s like it doesnt matter or sumn
pos,Pos,hopefully malones bench unit improves as we get murray back and monte shifts down to bench role staggering minutes with mpj and murray with bench might also help right now tho that 5 men bench unit is a guaranteed 20 every night
neg,Pos,the fuck was that double ejection loooollll
pos,Pos,gobert finally figured out how to stop jokic
pos,Pos,jokic always destroys gobert so it was a pity he couldnt go for 50 today but best news is the injury isn t serious we go again soon mpj pls wake up
pos,Pos,how re the nuggets playing 5 games in such a short time span
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,the nuggets could lose everyone except their backcourt and bol bol but malone would still find a reason not to play him
pos,Pos,i enjoy our strategy of scoring 120 points in every game
pos,Neg,bonk
neg,Pos,miles bridges is an all star
pos,Pos,i welcome our hornet overlords
pos,Pos,miles may be an all star this year obviously it s still early but i never thought i d contemplate the thought
pos,Pos,unpopular opinion perhaps but the magic won t be contending for a title this season
pos,Pos,winning on a melo off night feels good
neg,Neg,hornets vs bulls ecf just like we all thought
neg,Pos,miles bridges all star campaign
pos,Pos,how long until r nba catches up to the fact that lamelo isn t our only ridiculously good young player
pos,Pos,i ve seen enough build around cole and franz
pos,Pos,franz looked really solid suggs needs to come off the bench as soon as another pg is healthy or just let cole run point and start harris
pos,Pos,is bridges the hornets best player i thought it was lamelo
neg,Neg,miles bridges is a monster side note ish that was disrespectful
neg,Neg,miles bridges is awesome
pos,Pos,lamelo was horrible in all facets tonight his finishing around the rim still leaves some to be desired can t rely on the three all season our defense forced turnovers nice unfortunately when we don t force a large amount of them 15 ish our d looks poor okay now the good stuff miles man just wowwww unbelievable complete power and finesse around the rim them threes too gordo was horrible for around 1 5 quarters and then had a quiet and steady 24 points so fair play comart shot slowly looking actually legit jalen is our best defender and he better get minutes when terry and pj come back love how confident his open threes are this year on the magic side i don t wanna be that kissass but yeah they actually have a good young corps franz is dope but still yet to know who their star player is cole is a bucket
pos,Pos,miles bridges is something else man also we created 7 steals in the 4th quarter huge factor in us winning tonight
pos,Pos,give miles the fuckin super
pos,Pos,suggs isn t ready to start yet when fultz gets back he should go to the bench
pos,Neg,where tf did jalen mcdaniels come from
pos,Pos,do you guys hear a buzzing noise

pos,Pos,lamelo who miles bridges is the real franchise player
pos,Pos,gg magic impressed with some of your guys
neg,Neg,is miles zion with a jumper
pos,Pos,yo is miles already an all star insane how easy he can get 30
neg,Pos,this team is averaging over 120 points and their leading scorer from last season has barely played they re going to be fun this year
pos,Pos,competitive game tonight for the boys young guys getting experience while our other guys get healthy hey that s how it goes
neg,Pos,cody martin mvp campaign starting right here
pos,Neg,gg hornets nice to see bridges stepping up and improving his game dude killed us i see some of ya ll shit talking suggs he s having a rough month of offense but the shots he s taking ain t bad they ll start to drop eventually he definitely needs to work on his handles man can t get into the paint without losing the ball but that was the knock on him in college it s not an easy fix or something that can improve over night but hopefully he works on that as his career progresses but as of rn he shouldn t be in situations where he s handling the ball as much as he is leave that up to cole and markelle when he comes back
pos,Pos,bridges is an all star candidate
pos,Pos,wow suggs having a rough month
pos,Pos,really enjoying the energy hornets team plays with off game for lamelo but bridges has been on fire mip too many turnovers but they managed to pull it off i wish their games were easier to watch in ca can t they make a hometown exception to watch the ball boys
pos,Pos,mip mip mip
neg,Neg,miles is having the same sort of start that julius randle had last year
pos,Pos,miles bridges is also the greatest rapper player of all time
pos,Pos,this was a tough game because both teams played well overall but miles bridges scored 31 lol what can you do
pos,Pos,masai read jalen suggs for filth and he was right
neg,Pos,magic young guys looked good and also got the l all around win
pos,Pos,is bouknight injured or something
neg,Pos,at the magic game so many melo jerseys on and he has this game lol and kelly is so bad smh
pos,Pos,i remember being so angry we didn t pick suggs
pos,Pos,at this point i wonder why borrego starts lamelo over ish smith seems to like ish smith in those big moments more than melo lol
pos,Neg,miles bridges is my favorite college player of all time edges valentine by a little
neg,Neg,yo how much wheaties did miles bridges eat in the off season to be the cracked
neg,Pos,what a fucking breakout season from miles
pos,Pos,frantically typing miles bridges mip odds into google
pos,Pos,gordon hayward with 24 5 5 on 13 shots
pos,Neg,hornets shoulda paid my guy
pos,Pos,oubre and ball shooting a combined 4 21 tonight ouch good thing they were playing the magic
pos,Pos,who would have guessed miles bridges would be the front runner for mip
pos,Pos,yall really missed out on giddey for this dude damn
pos,Pos,thanks masai for jonny flynn 0 5
pos,Pos,i survived scott brooks for this
pos,Pos,beal needs to stop playing like ass but i will fucking take a road win in boston
pos,Pos,wtf celtics how are you going to do us like that on monday and then play this awful against the wizards
pos,Pos,dinwiddie is a baller
pos,Neg,tommy shepard goated
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,damn brad went 7 25 and they still won not a sentence that usually works
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i can t believe how good trezz has been i thought he got figured out after last season and the bubble postseason but he has been absolutely huge for us instant offense off the bench and his defense hasn t looked bad either
pos,Pos,considering how the lakers game is going i find the fact that kuz trez schroder and kcp all had good to ok games really amusing right now
pos,Pos,let s go i like sports and i don t care who knows
pos,Pos,3 1 baby let s gooooo montrezl harrell is an absolute beast
pos,Pos,i feel like im watching someone shove a square peg into a circle hole all night
neg,Pos,what an ugly ugly game
neg,Neg,brian scalabrene out here screaming like my dad at my rec league soccer games
neg,Pos,can we get a single ounce of credit for one of our wins or will every team we win against just have a bad night
pos,Pos,so what can tommy get for beal
neg,Neg,i like seeing 5 wizards in double digits
pos,Pos,damn there are like no celtics fans in this thread lol least amount of celtics i ve seen a while
pos,Pos,these games just show how bad scott brooks is i swear washington could have made the playoffs when they had beal and westbrook its sad that now he is gone so have the players edit oops i guess brodie and beal did will them to the playoffs could have done a lot better tho
pos,Pos,gg celtics bros refs were awful tonight
pos,Pos,tatum and horford had every right to jump the official
pos,Pos,bradley beal with the double double on 7 for 25 shooting what a win
pos,Pos,dinwiddie on tatum he s going to get all of the ovеrtime hоuse of highlights sportscenter highlights and all that but we got the win and that s all that matters shoutout smart being dogshit offensively again
pos,Pos,wiz win despite the beal
neg,Neg,that was a grown man basket by spencer to end that game
neg,Neg,badley beal spencer winwiddie boop u 1337speak
pos,Pos,jaylen brown
neg,Pos,get the wizards bedspread we coming for that totle boiiiii
pos,Pos,i guess the wizards won the trade
pos,Neg,beal s been bad in every way
pos,Neg,boston do y all just wanna like cuddle tonight or something nobody won here tonight
pos,Pos,neither jay was good enough offense has been sluggish if marred by shooting luck they _really_ need to figure out the defense
pos,Pos,celtics weren t good but nba refs are still garbage
pos,Pos,anyone else catch rob williams get a nut shot
pos,Neg,beal wouldnt have had the double double if not for the end of the half mishap streets ahead
pos,Pos,we need to improve our defense
pos,Pos,that westbrook trade looking real good for washington right now
neg,Neg,atlanta in town tonight depth vs depth see you there
neg,Neg,schroder is going to make marcus smart completely redundant by the trade deadline book it
pos,Pos,such a ugly game ime needs to give up the double big line up it s weird how he want s to stick it with it so bad the jays have terrible spacing when robert and al are in this double big line up has to end even if it means robert and al minutes go down just hurts the offense way too much
neg,Neg,god the celtics just suck lol
neg,Neg,i don t enjoy watching my favorite team celtics anymore they show very little effort frequently and seem complacent to be a mediocre team
pos,Pos,we have been rebuilding for nearly a decade now and this team is progressively getting worse but the jays the celtics organization needs to wake up and realize we can t win with these two as our best two players they aren t elite there are so many players in the east that are better but it seems like we are content with mediocrity
neg,Neg,kuz having a lower than beal is proof positive that stat is complete possum shit
pos,Pos,well at least our first 4 games had good officiating
pos,Pos,how the hell did bradley beal out rebound daniel gafford
pos,Pos,at least some of my lakers are winning
pos,Pos,dinwiddie is the true beard in the nba for get harden
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,i turned this on at the end of the third quarter and was switching between watching this and twitch seemed like every time i turned back the this game someone was at the ft line
pos,Pos,props to miami harden looks awful so far
pos,Pos,turns out the more shots you miss the more rebounds you can get
pos,Pos,pucker with a 24
pos,Pos,we might be good
pos,Pos,lets go heat barclays center
neg,Pos,love seeing that kyle is still putting up the most kyle lowry state lines in miami
pos,Pos,pj tucker
neg,Neg,good home win for the heat
neg,Pos,nets playing let s see how many different ways we can turn the ball over in the fourth the whole game honestly
pos,Pos,miami s going to leave october with wins over brooklyn and bucks in their back pocket
neg,Neg,pj tucker 24 what a great acquisition from heat
pos,Neg,man that was an ugly game but if we can do that to the nets and their offensive power i feel incredibly comfortable with what we can do to other teams i ll take sloppy shooting bad offense and elite defense if it leads to win herro bam and jimmy don t need to score 30 each to have a good game also that was 1 4 nets we see you 3 more times this season that was fun seeing what we are capable of
pos,Neg,i love plaxico jessica tucker so much
neg,Neg,our defense is insane lol
pos,Pos,heat are perfect when lowry plays
pos,Pos,i love pj
pos,Pos,thank you toronto
neg,Neg,yeah baby
pos,Neg,people who watch the nets a lot how do you like nash as a coach no recency bias pls
neg,Neg,that heat defense wow
pos,Pos,i was told pj tucker was washed and his defence on durant is overrated
pos,Pos,i m glad miami was able to get a win at their second arena
pos,Pos,i love our size against the nets 62 rebounds for us 42 for brooklyn 17 offensive rebounds is just mental with the majority coming from dedmon 6 jimmy 4 and pj 4 our 3 ball has also been crappy only going over 30 as a team in the opener vs milwaukee can t wait to see how we fair against the hot hornets
neg,Pos,thank fuck for the heat with the dolphins looking at watson panthers having hockey joe paterno and the marlins just being terrible i at least have the one functioning organization in south florida to look forward to a statement win against the nets
pos,Pos,31 2nd chance points to 4 never gonna win giving up points like that
pos,Neg,love to see dedmon doing well one of my favorite rebuild era hox
neg,Neg,steph trae and luka have all adjusted to the new rules while harden is still trying to flail and run into guys and shoot he s looked awful through 5 games
pos,Pos,duncan only gets 6 points with 2 7 shooting and still has a of 13 his gravity is worth more than his offense the new foul rules are helping him too he used to get in foul trouble early the more physical defense the league is allowing is working in his favor
pos,Pos,beautiful
pos,Pos,when s the last time pj attempted 10 shots ya love to see it
pos,Pos,nets can t win with harden playing like a cat
neg,Neg,pj and dedmond both had some offensive boards at some pretty big moments in the 3rd 4th qtr great game we re looking strong
neg,Neg,should the nets sign another big to help rebound
neg,Neg,nash can t coach and marks really signed carter and johnson over a decent defender rebounder
pos,Pos,the heat will drag you into the mud
pos,Pos,that rebounding advantage is just filthy disgusting really the only solution to shooting like shit is rebounding your own misses dedmon is legit one of the best role players we ve ever had butler was ridiculous on the boards and on d and so was pj
pos,Pos,butler being better than harden after the rule change was not on most people s bingo card
neg,Neg,nets have a huge rebounding problem from last year which still hasn t been addressed and harden playing passive isn t going to get it done multiple times he has a layup but he passes to a role player who either misses or he gets a turnover
pos,Pos,it s nice to immediately break above 500 after the shitbucket that was our last season
pos,Pos,god that was such an exciting game to watch offense got very rough in the second quarter but the second half was much better lowry already making such a huge impact let s fucking go
neg,Neg,omg let s fucking go
pos,Pos,best defense in the league
pos,Neg,this heat culture man getting them wins or what lmaoooo
pos,Pos,lmao harden
pos,Pos,officiating was ridiculous but that heat defense looks legit
pos,Pos,this nets team is the result of picking your friends over actual good players and staff
neg,Pos,someone invent a vaccine blowdart and snipe kyrie with it
pos,Pos,i expect to see at least one don t you regret not coming to the kniiiiiicks in every single one of these threads
pos,Pos,i wonder if kyrie is waiting for the nets to look bad and then try to play the role of savior technically as long as he s staying in shape he can literally come back at any moment he chooses
pos,Pos,james harden washed upvotes to the left
pos,Pos,for all of the focus harden is getting and it s deserved don t get me wrong the nets have some serious underlying issues so far that even if harden is playing better are big problems they are getting outshot by an average of 10 shots per game and the only game they haven t gotten destroyed on the offensive glass is their win against philly it s going to be hard to be a great team if they continue to have 10 shots compared to their opponent on average rebounding is a problem some guys looking at kd here seem allergic to boxing out
pos,Pos,game is way better when cheap boring weak shit isn t called for guys like harden idc if he sucks because of it look at steph or trae they are making do
pos,Pos,nets spacing is an absolute joke when considering how much talent they would appear to have on paper they actually remind me of the kd westbrook thunder in that regard
pos,Pos,so we gone talk about how trash harden has been with the rule change everyone is saying no kyrie doesn t matter because harden is going to put up dominant numbers now stephen a is saying harden is frustrated without kyrie because it s too much pressure on him what
neg,Neg,the rule changes might of ended james hardens career
pos,Pos,so how much did harden get nerfed in actuality
neg,Pos,i m here for the harden slander
pos,Pos,let s go heat
pos,Pos,serious question is kd a real hooper though
pos,Pos,james harden without the grift is tyreke evans
pos,Pos,that might be the first time miami has ever outscored an opponent in the third quarter
neg,Pos,i know he s eventually going to adjust but god damn has harden looked rough with the new rule change that and he s clearly out of shape
neg,Pos,does harden even care about basketball anymore
pos,Pos,direct correlation between how many quarters james harden tried to score in and how many the nets won
pos,Pos,plz come back kyrie
neg,Pos,cry me a river harden
pos,Pos,the nets primary issue thus far boils down to the fact that they re missing about 35ppg harden needs to be scoring 10 more ppg and the rule change doesn t excuse missing out on that scoring he should be able to find those points anyway he is literally one of the best scorers ever he just needs to be better adjust to the rule changes and be more aggressive it will take time but he just has to be better than 15 ppg and then of course they re missing 25 ppg from kyrie i don t know what to expect any more about that situation whether he will be back at any point or not but he has totally screwed his team pure and simple he is a huge part of this team and he left them in the dirt for some godforsaken and now they are figuring out on the fly how to adjust without a 25 ppg scorer a scorer who by the way would have no issues at all adjusting to these new rules because he never has been one to rely on the old rules we could get into the rebounding issues and their preference to treat this like its still preseason but ultimately it boils down to harden needing to be better and kyrie disappearing
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,harden has been terrible dude looked lost at times out there
pos,Pos,nets should resign mike d antoni as assistant coach again to unlock harden s full potential
neg,Pos,hello i am here for some james harden slander please
pos,Pos,itt everyone saying harden is bad because of the foul change but no one mentioning how he s probably still just rounding into shape from the injury
pos,Pos,james harden got nerfed with a single rule change and now he forgot how to basketball
neg,Pos,the officiating of this game was absolute clown shoes jfc
neg,Neg,holy shit the nets don t have any wings what were they thinking
neg,Pos,kd really can t win with these cats lol
pos,Pos,how did jimmy butler and kevin durant out rebound bam adebayo and blake griffin
neg,Pos,that s a nice pic of tyler herro
pos,Pos,it s nice to see the nets in a vulnerable position this league desperately needs some parity the awful lakers start was predictable but the nets struggling not so much harden looks like a shell of himself maybe he is injured i know the new rules are affecting him but there has to be something else maybe mental health like simmons
neg,Pos,nets seriously missed claxton would ve at least help with the rebounding and the 2nd chance pts
pos,Neg,fuck the lakers and the nets hope they both continue to suck superteams created artificially are bad for the league and not fun
pos,Pos,if the nets don t win a ring kd is going to pour espresso straight from jimmy s machine into his eyes
pos,Pos,harden looks washed so far
neg,Pos,i did not expect this start from nets lakers and clippers but here we are competitive bb amazing to watch
neg,Pos,harden just out of shape he will work his way back into form eventually the biggest worry for the nets should be that he gets hurt playing out of shape
neg,Pos,going to be pretty difficult for scottie barnes to win roty in a world where dalano banton exists
pos,Pos,we not gonna talk about how gtj s defense has jumped up so many levels dude was diving for the rock like crazy
pos,Pos,y all told me scottie was bad offensively
pos,Pos,future is bright for these raptors our half court offense is a work in progress for sure but the defensive intensity and overall effort level throughout the lineup has really impressed me really enjoying this season so far btw hope brogdon and jackson are okay
neg,Neg,raptors first real home win since february 23 2020 612 days
pos,Pos,solid raps w
pos,Pos,beam me up scottie
pos,Pos,feels bad for those injuries man and just when caris is about to come back
neg,Neg,they need to get rid of fouling to stop fast breaks it was so brutal tonight nba needs the fiba rule
pos,Neg,nate bjorkgen revenge game
neg,Neg,this sub is now r scottiebarnes and for good reason
neg,Pos,has anyone seen banton and dr j in the same room
pos,Pos,freddie with 10 rebounds sheesh
pos,Pos,doubling sabonis legit killed us if he can t score or pass the pacers are kinda fucked
pos,Pos,gg raps barnes looks incredible
pos,Pos,scottie barnes
pos,Pos,can the pacers play a game in toronto without getting injured fucking hell
pos,Neg,gtj has high key been amazing on defense he s been in a bit of a shooting slump but unlike last year he s not losing us points on the other end he s super aggressive on defense has great hands as well
pos,Neg,we finally won a home game
pos,Pos,scottie roy og mip
pos,Pos,fred with 10 boards
neg,Neg,the scotiabank scottie barnes arena
pos,Pos,that no look pass by scottie
pos,Pos,duarte is nice
pos,Pos,good to see freddie scoring more and scottie picking up the playmaking responsibility gonna be what s needed when siakam comes back
pos,Pos,inject that barnes dunk into my veins
pos,Pos,amazing game i m so glad that nurse decided to run the offense through a lot more players fvv off ball really is something else i hope this trend continues all these guys can move the ball well it shouldn t be stifled
neg,Pos,just 4 fgas for sabonis
pos,Neg,love the goran dnp cd in favour of minutes for dalano
neg,Neg,first win at home in forever
pos,Neg,did myles turner fuck somebody s wife or something
neg,Neg,gtj s shoes make it look like he s wearing socks and bright green slides out there it s messing with me
pos,Pos,how the hell did fred vanvleet out rebound sabonis
pos,Pos,masai knows jalen suggs worth better than jalen does
pos,Pos,why is sabonis only taking 4 shots
pos,Pos,raps assistant coach nate bjorkgren sends his regards
pos,Pos,it might be a homer take but scottie og precious gtj fvv pascal is one of the deepest teams in terms of young talent when everyone is able to develop a bit more and if we re able to get a solid role piece or two to fill in the gaps we re back to a dominating regular season team will take a few years but it s awesome seeing the team grow
pos,Pos,damn fred with 10 rebounds
pos,Pos,absolutely smothered sabonis tonight
neg,Pos,as hyped as it was to see scottie og and fvv all play great i felt really bad with the pacers losing so many players to injury this started out as a game i felt fairly comfortable though not entirely that we d win and ended with putting down a team that simply did not have the healthy players to win a win is a win but you could see how demoralized the pacers became when brogdon came out
pos,Pos,gotta name the arena after him not an overreaction
neg,Pos,dragic pkaying no mintes helos vanvleet for mvp
pos,Pos,scottie barnes
pos,Pos,i would die for scottie barnes
pos,Pos,our project already one of our best players all the magic fans clowning us for coping real quiet now
pos,Pos,pacers only win is really is vs us we just convincingly best the nets too what the fuck
pos,Pos,og is becoming a great isolation threat fvv is becoming a range less spot up shooter look out league pascal will be back soon and scottie can do a lot too
pos,Pos,should ve drafted suggs
pos,Pos,first home win in 600 days sounds wayyyyy worse than it actually is lmfao
pos,Pos,mavs beat raptors raptors beat pacers therefore mavs pacers suck it rick
neg,Neg,man the pacers looks really bad
pos,Pos,why the hell did sabonis only take 4 shots
pos,Pos,obviously a bit of a homer but i legit believe that as the team gels siakam comes in the raps should be far scarier in 3 months
pos,Pos,18 steals good lord all those extra shahts
pos,Pos,the raptors have too many good players after the big four of barnes og fred siakam there are like 8 9 solid to good players who all deserve playing time precious trent dragic birch boucher banton yuta flynn even svi s looking fucking fantastic hopefully we can bundle some up with some picks for an upgrade because it s hard to have a 12 deep rotation
pos,Pos,ain t no bitches getting they asshoes bleached for nothing when we got scottie b in the house
pos,Neg,scottie barnes is fucking here baby
pos,Pos,how is indy 1 4 they have sabonis and brogden two players who each would easily be the magic s or other bad teams s best players then you add in lavert and other talent they have like that rookie who is balling they should be a 5 8 seed easy what am i missing here
neg,Pos,if you or a loved one are suffering from bleeding of the ears caused by exposure to a loud woman near a crowd mic at the end of this game you may be entitled to substantial financial compensation
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,bro that was a buttcheeks no call on tae
pos,Pos,shoutout to the lady screaming her ass off for trae and the hawks near the end of the broadcast
pos,Pos,the hawks were a more cohesive team tonight and that got them the victory our 3 pm shooting could have been better jv with 13 and 15 i hate to chalk this up to growing pains but anybody expecting the pelicans to be a pushover simply because zion is out is clearly mistaken
pos,Pos,guess i ll just roll the clip
pos,Neg,the zionless pelicans are surprisingly good when we re not throwing the ball away like crazy
pos,Pos,jc was fucking huge tonight with 7 offensive boards shout out to herb jones as well dude is a defensive monster already
pos,Pos,man those refs were terrible for everyone just really inconsistent
pos,Neg,the end of games are about to be a slug fest there was like 10 calls in the last minute that they would have made last year
pos,Pos,i just want zion back man
pos,Pos,trae young 31 points 3 free throws find a new slant r nba
pos,Pos,out of all the people who were supposed to get hit hard by the new rules trae actually seems to have taken the smallest hit by far
pos,Pos,is it me or is the scoring in games this year gone back down a touch
pos,Pos,got killed on the glass and went cold from downtown in the second half shitty loss hopefully this isn t the start of an avalanche for us
neg,Pos,bummer
pos,Pos,trae is really about to average like 24 9 across his rookie contract i think he might be legit guys
pos,Pos,trae
neg,Neg,devonte should ve shot two free throws at the end there man
pos,Pos,played them good without zion can t ask for much more winning this would be stealing a game we probably shouldn t have won
neg,Neg,trae 31 points on 3 fta lmao find a new narrative
pos,Pos,jc at the 5 2nd unit swung this game
pos,Pos,heard of herb jones in college didn t expect him to be an actual starter like i thought naji or trey was gonna start gg zion less pels
pos,Pos,john collins
pos,Pos,the pels offense in the last minute made me feel unwell great work by hunter
neg,Neg,damn bruh then new rules got trae looking bad not
pos,Pos,pels playing great without zion they will win a lot more games if he can get back on the court
pos,Pos,clear foul on devonte on that second last possession 2 free throws would have put us up 1 with 8 seconds left still happy with how we played against a team in the ecf last year without zion
pos,Pos,herb jones looking like a young de andre hunter out there
neg,Neg,zion was rocking the naruto luffy saitama jacket with the manga pants what a madlad
pos,Neg,zions fit is unmatched he clearly hangs out with the hottest dudes
pos,Pos,trae in full offensive carry mode it seems
pos,Pos,naw played like shit tn
pos,Pos,ingrams ill advised 3 with like a minute left early in the shot clock and then an airball with 10 seconds left trying to be the hero ffs give it to graham
pos,Pos,ingram has to be the least clutch player in the league
pos,Pos,ingram loves chucking up ugly fucking shots not like it matters season was doomed the moment zion decided to become nba jamarcus russell
neg,Pos,bruh
pos,Pos,herb jones is gonna get paid a lot one day btw
pos,Pos,lol we are the same exact team every year
pos,Pos,removed
neg,Pos,bless the pelicans
pos,Pos,trae is a superstar
pos,Pos,lol there s no chance the pels are able to keep zion after next season
pos,Pos,pelicans are a disgrace
neg,Pos,zion gone
pos,Pos,man twolves outplayed us today their big 3 looks so damn good i miss jrue and brook
pos,Pos,the difference in how much the vikings and packers hate each other and how much the wolves and bucks appear to have some love for each other especially kat and giannis is hilarious
pos,Pos,81 1
neg,Pos,a lone star big man dominating and doing everything he can to win while his support cast shits the bed at both ends getting beaten by a serious team effort from a collection of high level players has been the story of this matchup the last few years but this one feels a bit different somehow ant is a monster though love that dude
pos,Pos,anthony edwards is turning into something special right before our eyes attitude is there potential is there he s putting it together now
pos,Pos,for the first time in fiserv forum the bucks never held a lead for a second in this game i love this team i hope the bucks make the finals again lets go wolves awoooooo

pos,Pos,ant is an all star already
pos,Pos,football boy
pos,Pos,this win is big we nearly lost in classic wolves fashion lol dlo finally had his redemption game edwards turned up clutch in the end kat had a lot of stupid turnovers but he kept his cool and didn t whine to refs and otherwise had a great game vando mcdaniels are hidden mvps on the bucks end holy shit giannis is so fucking good it s unfair i thought we did a good job defending the rim but there s nothing you can do against that middleton didn t have a good game but turned into a clutch god in the closing minutes bucks role players missed some easy threes that would ve probably resulted in them winning anyways thank god we got this win also thank god we didn t play the full strength bucks tonight
pos,Pos,the statline didn t capture how well kat played tonight
pos,Pos,kat and giannis trading jerseys after the game
pos,Pos,anthony edwards
pos,Pos,that was a damn good win for the wolves i figured we d be able to comeback and pull away eventually but they just kept piling on they re going to be a pain in the ass for alot of teams this year in the west
pos,Pos,everyone but giannis has to do better than what just happened
pos,Pos,i play with fuckin passion kat dgaf about live tv
pos,Pos,we re going 81 1 now bois
pos,Pos,that was something ant is fearless
pos,Pos,i cant wait for jrue to come back i cant stand george hill minutes any more
neg,Neg,that s an efficient game by kat
pos,Pos,fully deserved win by the timberwolves shot making was spectacular they played middleton great and felt like they got every big rebound that said not much to take away from it on the bucks end no jrue lopez or donte and the offense was generating looks they should be happy with they just weren t going in tonight 35 fg for the team outside giannis
neg,Pos,if you don t love me at my andrew wiggins you can t love me when i m anthony edwards
pos,Pos,nba champions baby lets fucking goooooo

pos,Pos,pretty impressive comeback all things considered a great giannis performance wasted
pos,Pos,the boarder battle stuff would have been way better if we were in the same division ant is a bad man though
pos,Pos,team shot like trash but made it competitive cant be mad kat should really shoot more lmao need my jrue and brook back t t
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,ant is literally the player the timberwolves have been looking for their entire franchise history team has had good big men kg kevin love kat but never that star perimeter player you sort of need to truly compete for championships in today s nba thought we had him finally when we got jimmy butler oops thought andrew wiggins could turn into that player ouch now it looks like we finally got a real one
pos,Pos,beating the bucks makes minnesota the best team in the nba
pos,Pos,giannis nearly willed them back into the game lol
pos,Pos,some blatant defensive gaps without jrue and lopez with that being said the main reason bucks lost this is because they bricked sooo many wide open 3s for a home game especially
pos,Pos,is it just me or should kat be taking way more shots
pos,Pos,the one thing the wolves are really lacking is basketball iq it s super evident when bev who has a very high iq is on the court
neg,Pos,wolves are going to be a problem for teams this year idk how many games they will end up winning but they are a tough team if they are going to defend like that
pos,Pos,who s idea was it to let george hill take that last shot wtf should have went into either giannis or khris hands all in all a good comeback just not enough and we desperately need jrue and brook back
neg,Pos,fucking passion
pos,Pos,ant jordan reincarnated edwards is the love of my life
pos,Pos,im not gonna say the s word
pos,Neg,81 1 is back on the menu boys never a doubt in my mind
pos,Pos,wolves are looking so spooky
neg,Neg,them boys thurskii
neg,Neg,t wolves fans have suffered enough they deserve a good team
neg,Neg,anthony edwards is an all star
pos,Neg,50 wins wolves lets gooo
neg,Neg,hang the banner baby
pos,Pos,middleton was ass tonight
neg,Neg,i haven t seen this many twolves flair in a long time nice win tonight
pos,Neg,i m going into minneapolis tomorrow for a family event and i m definitely rooting for the wolves to keep winning minnesota is a cool place and you guys deserve to have some winning again
pos,Pos,bucks fan here timberwolfs have something special to look forward to another edwards is lit
pos,Pos,i blame the pelicans
neg,Pos,safe to say this wasn t a shooting clinic happy with the effort from the wolves guys like vando came up huge gg to the bucks if they started their comeback one minute earlier this result would have changed giannis is truly an unstoppable cheat code that i am happy we only face twice a year
pos,Pos,somebody please help giannis
pos,Pos,ant really rescued us at the end there i can t wait to see him play in the postseason
pos,Pos,wolves ain t on that bullshit this year
pos,Pos,good game from both teams giannis was a monster of course 40 point performance
pos,Neg,it finally feels good to watch wolves games unfortunately we couldn t pull it off at the end but i m happy for my wolves bros and gals kat and ant are incredible and d lo might finally not be frustrating for me to watch
pos,Pos,giannis is ridiculous even in a loss
pos,Neg,anthony edwards might deserve the mvp for making kat and dlo give a shit
pos,Pos,ben about to catch a red eye to milwaukee get giannis the help he needs
neg,Neg,miss jrue and brook good to see us battle back from some pretty big deficits tho
pos,Neg,dare i say the timberwolves look
neg,Neg,giannis is so damn good really glad to see the wolves pull this one out and get their first win in milwaukee of kat s career just one game but good to see some of the wolves potential this season
pos,Neg,i think we did as well as we could have being down three starters and with the wolves being locked in antman is great dude had no fear at all in the closing minutes
pos,Pos,how y all lose to the wolves also ik defense is just reputation to fans but kat has played legit good defense this year
pos,Neg,good game buckssbros you guys really played us close and gave us a scare there y all have a lot of young talent and boy that gainnis middelton middleton sure looked good y all sure will be scary next year
pos,Pos,ant cooked middleton three straight times but only got one to go
neg,Pos,lets gooooo
pos,Pos,gg wolves bros spooky season
pos,Pos,semi oof
neg,Neg,giannis needs to either be outlawed from the nba or maybe the nba needs to implement some rock n jock style hoops and he is only allowed to score on the 25 hoop
pos,Pos,not worried about this specific loss but am worried about our long term front court depth we are just not good defensively without brook except for some particular matchups situations we should definitely try to acquire a decent rim protector before the playoffs if that s even possible lol
pos,Pos,when giannis scores 40 and the next guy is at 16 eh gg wolves
pos,Pos,timberpups just wanted it more than us and we re too short handed to coast like that gg
neg,Neg,just to show how scary giannis is dlo took 25 shots to score 29 points ant took 24 shots to score 25 points giannis took 23 shots to score 40 points
pos,Pos,ant still had the wiggins statline but man that drive at the end was so clutch
neg,Neg,i see ant saw my advice to tell dlo to stop sucking after their first loss of the season youre welcome
pos,Pos,wolves are only going to get better with their young core good game tonight we wound up on the losing end but given we had 3 guys playing their first minutes of the year and missing our 3rd and 4th best players as well as missing a ton of very open 3s i can t get too upset about taking the l tonight
pos,Pos,bruh sound effect
pos,Pos,yo
neg,Neg,ant clutched up really enjoyable game to watch
neg,Neg,y all look so different
pos,Pos,ant says fuck that loss i ll take this win
pos,Pos,ant with the and 1 to close it out was special of course the wolves had to make it interesting
pos,Pos,wolves won baby
pos,Pos,although ant was not very efficient that plus one was so clutch he is very deadly on drives
neg,Neg,kat only had 3 rebounds and the wolves won wow excellent play from the entire team
pos,Pos,spooooooky
pos,Pos,wolves are spooky
neg,Neg,wolves fixed
pos,Pos,we would have lost this game any other season love the fight from our players so far this season
pos,Pos,huge win for the wolves hopefully they can keep this going
pos,Pos,thats such an impressive immediate turnaround from this team and last game
pos,Pos,timberwolves winning games am i in coma
neg,Neg,ant is giving me hope i m scared
pos,Neg,stop the count i like the standings how they are right now
pos,Pos,as we all expected giannis was the bucks best player from 3
pos,Pos,russell edwards and kat a decent semi big three there i always thought the wolves were better than their record in past years wish them nothing but the best
neg,Pos,first the lakers then the clippers now this calling it now t wolves and cavs in the finals
pos,Pos,i really love our core but man we might be the shallowness decent team in the league one injury to kat ant or dlo and our rotation will be in shables
pos,Pos,my hoe from the midwest she a minnesota bimbowolf
neg,Neg,most meaningful timberwolves win since that essentially play in game back when butler was on the team
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,14 51 on threes with basically every attempt wide open oof
neg,Pos,ngl wolves were very spooked in that last 2 mins our defense evaporated almost literally lol team needs to work on that very embarrassing ant only reason for that win
pos,Pos,bucks have no center and it s showing also how the hell did kat get out rebounded by jaden mcdaniels and jarred vanderbilt sad
pos,Pos,missing jrue and brook bad giannis looks scary though for minn ant is going to be really good should be an interesting division once they eventually get moved over for seattle
neg,Pos,what an strange strange night of basketball
pos,Pos,kat might have finally got it and when i say it i mean anthony edwards
pos,Pos,oh shit wasn t even following this coz of work spooky wolves back
pos,Pos,just like we all predicted
pos,Pos,damn imagine if you had a 2 game parlay on the wolves and thunder
neg,Pos,in this box score it says connaughton played center tonight is that actually what happened
pos,Pos,of course russell wakes up against us
pos,Pos,spooky szn is upon us
pos,Pos,damn
pos,Pos,is vanderbilt gonna get played more often now how can you go from basically 0 minutes on the season to 30 this game
pos,Pos,edwards what a competitor
pos,Pos,jordant is special
pos,Pos,it s pretty funny how the box score lists pat connaughton as a center
pos,Pos,pat as a fuckin center what s clownada
neg,Pos,giannis is like if kg was in this era and greek
neg,Neg,what s so shocking about this result the thunder are pretty good when westbrook gets a triple double
pos,Pos,okc kept turning over just to see how many bricks the lakers could put up lol
pos,Pos,okc tried so hard to give it away at the end but lakers just couldn t stop air balling wide open 3s
pos,Neg,i guess r nba was wrong melo and westbrook can lead okc to wins
neg,Pos,lakers killed the dream of an 0 82 season shame on them
pos,Pos,giddey up folks what do you mean breathe breathe
pos,Pos,joshua giddey
pos,Pos,i am sorry but the lakers deserve two ls for this game not even considering that they should be the better team but because they were up by 28 at one point i am glad sga and giddey played so well but this is the type of game i want to see from bazley that ending was a lot of question marks thought okc was trying to throw
pos,Pos,like the lakers commentator said this should count as two wins for okc lol
pos,Pos,okc almost snatched defeat from the jaws of victory
pos,Pos,haha quick guys look over there it s ben simmons and kyrie doing stuff don t pay attention to us
pos,Pos,we tried our best to lose but in the end the lakers did even better at losing than us giddey is great
neg,Pos,from a lead where lebron can do some bottle flip challenge to a loss that can lead to another rdc video fuck
pos,Pos,yikes 98 7 win probability
pos,Pos,would you like to win tonight no thank you no i insist
pos,Pos,sga braid up is clean af
neg,Neg,how you like that r nba you can suck my tanking nuts thunder the fuck up baby
pos,Pos,lakers have officially entered dortcon 1
neg,Neg,okc saw the 3rd quarter warriors and sharingan d that shit today
pos,Neg,shai is pretty hot
neg,Neg,love giddey and giddey culture
neg,Pos,two chances to tie the game and all the lakers can come up are two airballs i think that s not optimal for their objective to win this basketball game
neg,Neg,weird i tried to watch the game but it was just a gif of the lakers punching themselves in the face for an hour
pos,Pos,westbrook is one of the most raw players in the history of the nba he has tremendous athleticism and work rate together with some of the worst decision making i ve ever seen
pos,Pos,man this thunder team is bad but i love them i love shai and giddey like they re my own kids i m just happy to see them happy and see them having fun
pos,Pos,westbrook with the quadruple double 20 14 13 10 and a solid 12 tonight
pos,Pos,lakers going for the eight seed again i see
neg,Neg,as someone who didn t watch this game is the best summary of it westbrook and melo looked like their old selves in the first quarter and then played like their current selves afterward
pos,Pos,classic westbrook game triple double lots of shots on poor efficiency ill advised and badly missed 3 in crunch time and then gets ejected after getting overly upset about that last play edit and how could i forget the 10 tos
pos,Pos,lmfao everybody get in here
pos,Neg,lebron still has it but legm doesn t
pos,Pos,westbrook is a hilarious player i swear there has never been a player that is full brainless idiot one second and a legendary point guard the next and repeat having him in your team that s like i would lose a few braincells as a neutral it s funny 20 shots to score 20 points 13 assists but also 10 turnovers gets a clutch offensive board hits the layup takes a dumb three after and bricks and at the end gets ejected the duality of this man he s done it for over a decade too and has not changed you would think he chills down and gets smarter nope the ending was fucking hilarious it was like two bad tanking teams with airballs and bad decisions okc tired really hard to throw and lakers tried really hard to not win
neg,Pos,imagine before the season saying the lakers would give okc their first win of the season lmao
pos,Pos,this is not the outcome either team was looking for
neg,Pos,ngl the lakers might just straight up suck lol
pos,Pos,are must see tv all their games have been really fun
pos,Pos,russ getting mad at someone else for statpadding was a nice twist ending
pos,Pos,who else loves it when la loses
pos,Pos,cant wait for the future thread when the knicks bing bong the lakers as well
pos,Pos,when your favorite player is fighting players from your favorite team
pos,Pos,rip westbrook is good and the haters were wrong hypetrain oct 26 2021 oct 27 2021
neg,Neg,well this does it young old
pos,Neg,this season has been an absolute blast so far
pos,Pos,it always cracks me up how losing teams try their hardest to score even tho the game is over but god forbids the winning team does cause the losing team gets salty af it s so hypocritical if you re trying to win a game down 5 with no time outs and 5 seconds left don t fucking cry if the other teams scores too
pos,Pos,ad is so soft
pos,Pos,ad is just the biggest bitch man he was taking step back midrangers over 20 year olds 5 inches shorter than him don t quote me that box score nephews
pos,Neg,loss angeles
pos,Pos,lakers are full of washed up veterans what do they expect
neg,Neg,westbrick just trying to give back to okc
pos,Pos,lakers fans seem to really want to blame vogel but the hard pill to swallow is that this roster just isnt great whoever made these decisions should be under fire the roster is constructed as if a nephew was allowed to grab whatever players they wanted for their team and the irony here is that they got westbrook so they could win games when bron or ad rest but westbrook just isnt that guy pal
pos,Pos,giddy gotta be great
neg,Neg,relegate the lakers to g league
pos,Pos,lakers sub imploding rn calling for vogel s head
pos,Pos,lebron hittin up rich paul like you gotta get me tf outta here
pos,Pos,i was pissed off about the nets loss and tuned into the lakers collapse just in time to see what was one of the funniest moments i ve ever seen watching basketball with that melo airball thank you melo that made my night
pos,Pos,i got boner lol
pos,Neg,the future is now old men
pos,Pos,russell westbrook with a quadruple double
pos,Pos,i remember lakers fans a year ago talking about a threepeat
pos,Pos,malik monk took a paycut for this
neg,Neg,lakers fans silent again after screaming about their first win and hyping up westbrook yesterday lmfao
pos,Pos,this will hurt westbrick s triple double winning percentage that you westbrooks fans keep flaunting around
neg,Pos,dam i was in the lakers sub yesterday telling em to sit ad and jus let russ play cuz we suck then we beat them with both of em playing lmao lakers gotta get it together no championship team should b losing to us lebron or not
pos,Pos,can i overreact now or is still only 5 games 11 35 31 4 blowing a 28 point lead
pos,Pos,my disappointment is unreal holy shit
pos,Pos,lol lakers would be 0 5 if people made their free throws lol
neg,Neg,the need to rename the lakeshow to the shitshow
pos,Pos,westbrook when he finds out okc was winless before this game
pos,Pos,lakers are the worst team in the league again until they win am i doing it right
pos,Pos,giddey will be either the best or second best guard from the draft this season depending on how the number 1 pick plays
pos,Pos,never understood the whole thing about not scoring at the end i know it s about respect to the opposition but this is a young team who just had a remarkable comeback in front of their home crowd let them enjoy the win plus bazley would have been full of adrenaline after stealing that ball with the crowd screaming behind him might just be me but if you have an open dunk to seal the game take it
pos,Pos,okc tried their best to recover for the tank but lakers outtanked them byron scott would be proud
pos,Pos,monk if you wanted to ring chase you could ve just stayed put
pos,Pos,my theory is legm got all his friends together so they can tank and draft for his son next season leconspiracy
pos,Pos,can we talk about the two inbounds plays before melo got that steal you take one timeout and the best thing you came up with was westbrook shooting a 3 and then you take a second timeout to tell monk iso and shoot like curry
pos,Pos,buddy hield would not have airballed that
neg,Pos,how can a team with 3 all stars lose to okc
pos,Pos,lmfao
pos,Pos,dafuq happened i remember looking at this box score halfway through the game and literally thinking to myself this win is meaningless because okc isn t even a real team
neg,Pos,warriors getting out of the west this year easily if this is their biggest challenge edit typo
pos,Pos,that ending was about the 3 worst minutes of basketball i ve ever seen
pos,Pos,didn t watch this one but my heart fluttered when i got the score notification i love when the lakers lose oh what a great day
pos,Pos,first quarter okc 19 41 lal wtf
neg,Neg,imagine giving up at least 15 points to every okc starter
neg,Pos,this lakers team is so bad it is glorious to watch
neg,Neg,no blue balls today
pos,Pos,my dort is hard
pos,Pos,fuck that unwritten rule shit it s only a 5 point game dunk it and end it for sure thunder just got their big win of the year and russ is gonna act like that dunk is over the line
neg,Neg,russell westbrook with his patented triple double while 12
pos,Pos,it s still so funny they chose westbrook over hield kcp
neg,Pos,everybody get in here
pos,Pos,russ getting mad because the guy dunked it like you ve never stat padded russ what a fucking hypocrite
pos,Pos,lebron turns on force trades
neg,Pos,giddey is good man
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,people are gonna continue to cite being 5 games in or injuries as reasons not to panic about this lakers team but they re just lying to themselves this team just isn t that good full stop westbrook will have his occasional great game like last night but his awful ones will happen far more often there is zero 0 excuse as to why a team like this should be blowing 20 point leads to the worst and youngest team in the league the defense is non existent and the offense doesn t inspire confidence either at least last years team had an identity in their elite defense i m not sure if it was pelinka or lebron s doing but regardless this last off season was a complete failure i ll get heat for saying it but this team just doesn t stand a chance against the elite teams of the league
pos,Pos,russ will be unbeatable in the cripple double category when his career is finished
pos,Neg,lakers had no less than 3 chances to lead or tie and they fumbled all of them this is a godlevel choke
neg,Neg,giddy s gonna make a thunder fan out of me
pos,Pos,i m randy marsh nutting on his keyboard when i see the lakers lose like this
pos,Neg,how did we get out tanked
pos,Pos,which team is supposed to be tanking
pos,Pos,lmfao you lost to okc
neg,Pos,the retirement home is in for a rough season better hope ad stays healthy or it ll turn into an even bigger shitshow
pos,Pos,i can t believe bazemore and melo are playing 27 mins and 30 mins for them
pos,Pos,i was very impressed by derrick favors tonight i miss having him on our team and i m glad he is doing well
neg,Pos,the lakers without kuzma and caruso is not a championship contender and a game like this further proves that take
pos,Pos,my dad runs into my room last night to give me the play by play of this game screaming like a mad man mind you i m 38 left when i was 18 and moved in this year to help with some surgeries both parents had this year this is what the lakers have done to me
neg,Neg,russell westsook
pos,Pos,wait suns is 1 3 their only win is against us well that makes me even more sad
neg,Neg,lost to sacramento off a 3 day rest record is 1 3 ayton didnt get max robert sarver bombshell hasn t dropped yet no controversy or need to look over here we re doing just fine thanks
pos,Pos,double digit lead in the game unbelievable collapse in the final minutes this was a kings game if i ve ever seen one except we actually won lol
neg,Neg,what a fuckin shot by barnes
pos,Pos,anyone who thinks harrison barnes is overpaid can shut the fuck up
pos,Pos,kings have graduated from blowing big leads in the 4th to almost blowing big leads in the 4th
neg,Neg,hb is the best player on the kings
pos,Pos,kings came out possessed in the second half and almost choked
pos,Neg,phoenix did not call a timeout for their last possession and i m 99 sure it s because they didn t want davion mitchell to sub in kid makes an impact when he s not even in the game
pos,Neg,not sure how i feel about this our kings loss looks better but our suns win looks a little worse
pos,Pos,harrison barnes is that guy
pos,Neg,kings amaze me lol they ve managed to clutch wins against phoenix and portland while making plenty of crunch time blunders
pos,Pos,caw caw caw black falcon
pos,Pos,it is endlessly fucking frustrating that the kings play pretty good basketball for the first 43 minutes and turn into an ncaa mid major team trying to hold onto a lead in the last 5 minutes it drives me absolutely crazy but barnes edit jesus christ
pos,Pos,i knew hb was going to hit that
neg,Neg,gg kings can t even be mad the better team won tonight we were lucky to even be in that position with 3 seconds left
pos,Pos,i ain t even mad that was a dime barnes is a dog
pos,Pos,hb does it again so hyped right now but buddy carried us to this one
neg,Pos,they fought hard but in the end we proved to sacramento that we just wanted to lose more
neg,Pos,kings couldn t miss from 3 the last 10 minutes god damn good game guys
pos,Neg,clearly ayton s teammates don t want him to get a max contract a very typical strong half only to barely touch the ball the 2nd half
pos,Pos,looks like chris paul had an off night
pos,Pos,if buddy plays in the last 2 minutes of a game again imma shoot myself
pos,Pos,i want to say the league as a whole look very even even bottom feeders like okc have decent young cores that can surprise anyone on a given night teams like kings can be decent and playoff level if they hit their stride i mean just look at kings starters they have scorers at most positions
pos,Neg,very much loving the kings this year always had the talent seem to have captured some fire
pos,Pos,suns gonna sun
neg,Neg,barnes always hit incredible game winners miss you black falcon
neg,Neg,thats kardiac kings baby i almost turned the game off we win but your guaranteed a nerve racking ending
pos,Neg,i have hope the suns had an off night
pos,Pos,i fucking love harrison barnes never leave baby
neg,Neg,way too close for comfort
pos,Neg,scrawwwwwwww
pos,Pos,the two teams that were in the finals lost to the wolves and kings today
pos,Neg,getting flashbacks to pre 2019 suns with the buzzer
pos,Pos,man i m a neutral fan but i just want to see the kings make the playoffs for once i hope they keep this up
pos,Pos,off night strikes again
pos,Pos,i want buddy
pos,Pos,cavs fans having flashbacks with that shot
pos,Pos,honestly not as happy as i should be with this win obviously barnes has been awesome and buddy played well for the most part today but fox needs to step it up i m really hoping this is just a slow start still happy that in the end of the day it s a tally in the win column but i have a feeling this team is going nowhere yet again this season
neg,Pos,booker ayton and bridges the offense should ran trough these 3 crowder is garbage and the team is way worse when paul is holding the ball for 20s
pos,Pos,damn i m just realizing that ayton had 21 and 21
neg,Neg,fuck the refs this dub is ours barnes has been killing it this season so it s only a matter of time before boston fans start spaming us with their shit trade offers
pos,Pos,lmao what was that ending
pos,Pos,didn t watch did davion lock up cp3
pos,Neg,cp3 slow pace ruins the team
pos,Neg,did davion mitchell guard paul or booker more
pos,Pos,shame that that 2016 finals will forever cloud our judgment of hb
pos,Pos,if i lick a sun is it sunnilingus
pos,Pos,lmao
neg,Neg,damn
pos,Pos,bleach era suns type game
pos,Pos,living up to his high school hype
pos,Pos,wooooooooow
pos,Pos,don t let the barnes game winner distract from buddy s performance this game
pos,Pos,what a clutch shot at the end by hb that was a crazy end there
pos,Neg,h3rrison barn3s
pos,Pos,cavs game winner pt2
pos,Pos,bang
pos,Pos,my stream cut out right before the final play i refreshed it in time to see everyone hugging
pos,Pos,certainly earlyish still but the west isn t going to have a lot of wiggle room could be looking at an away play in game if we lose 35 games edit would be only mildly surprising to see 45 losses
pos,Pos,i want barnes
pos,Neg,we were up 10 with under 3 minutes and i foolishly thought we might win a game against a good team with a comfortable lead in the final seconds
pos,Pos,so bulls are 4 0 against pistons x2 nola raps suns are 1 3 and lost to the kings who do you rate higher
pos,Pos,how i m doing as a suns fan rn
pos,Pos,everything i know about being a kings fan told me that wasn t going in i m so confused right now
pos,Pos,i m glad we pulled this one off damn refs nearly won it for the suns lmao
neg,Pos,our offense fucking sucks when cp3 is in the game idc the last play call for book sums it up let cp3 dribble the air out the ball then expect book to do something with 3 seconds we ran book at point and allowed him to create which led to the comeback
pos,Pos,why does this always happen to us
pos,Pos,lakers missing out on buddy hield
pos,Pos,one of marvin bagley s better games
neg,Neg,this was the line 225 5 over 110 under 110 how do they know
pos,Pos,fuck
pos,Pos,phoenix is now 1 3 since acquiring chandler hutchison
pos,Pos,as a laker fan this does help me cope with blowing a 26 point lead a little
neg,Neg,bad start for the suns looks like i jinx them lmfao
pos,Pos,still don t know why we went after wb instead of hield
pos,Pos,1 3 start would typically have me concerned but that was one helluva buzzer beater
neg,Neg,i know is early on the season but how fun is this the team that didn t make the playoffs has a better record then the team that went to the finals
pos,Pos,timberwolves are 3 1 kings are 2 2 let s go bizarro nba
pos,Pos,where was this harrison barnes in the 2016 finals
pos,Pos,weird young season
pos,Pos,when mb doesn t play kings are way better
pos,Pos,wiggins for barnes bring the 2015 team back
pos,Pos,are people gonna overreact like y all do to the lakers every time we lose
neg,Pos,fox needs to cut the weight right now he is the epitome of kangz basketball
pos,Pos,refs knows the o u of this game
pos,Pos,undefeated when dame makes a 3
neg,Pos,really impressed with ant was hitting some great shots in the first half when dame had gone missing
pos,Neg,i enjoyed watching the blazers play defense nice
pos,Pos,every blazers game is either us getting blown out blowing someone out or dame hitting a game winner just three options over and over again
pos,Pos,hooo boy that was cathartic good team win
pos,Pos,it s so crazy to me that we have a bench that actually gains and builds leads rather than blowin em
neg,Pos,blazers have a defense league fucked
pos,Neg,this team is either super hot or terrible these first couple games can t believe our d kept ja down as well as they did
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,larry nance jr is so good
pos,Pos,2 very good wins 2 very bad losses team is making rotation mistakes all over but at least there s promise with no powell and dame shooting like westbrook i don t feel terrible at 2 2 we also have the hardest first 20 games in the league
pos,Pos,ant is playing extremely well
neg,Pos,besides the offball movement the defensive rotations the diverse lineups i honestly think my favorite thing about this team so far is seeing dame on the bench with 6 min left watching the young guys get actual run in a game instead of stotts playing dame until the final 90 seconds down by 30
neg,Pos,ja has some of that old man game vet experience game to him getting defenders to attach to his hip and hesitating long enough to expose the big and capable of making every pass out of it dudes special
pos,Pos,we have a top 5 bench idc
neg,Neg,larry nance was a insanely huge pickup
pos,Pos,lillard finally looked more back to normal solid gamd by the blazers 2nd unit to pull away
pos,Pos,going by this rate our second team scrubs is playing more mins than the first team we are always either blowing ppl out or get blown out
pos,Pos,1 ducking rebound from a triple double
pos,Pos,jenkins is gonna be a force of a coach for years to come mem are gonna win games becuase of ja grit and defense but damn they re gonna lose some due to their erratic shooting
pos,Pos,i really think ant is going to be a legit second option star in the league in the next few years
pos,Pos,roco going 1 4 from 3 with 4 boards and 3 fouls while still being 8 is a wtf box score
pos,Pos,this team isn t there yet but goddamn the flashes of good defense with good offense look amazing
pos,Pos,if jjj could get consistent with his shooting we ll be in a pretty good place until then it s going to be a tossup at best 3 13 is downright pathetic
neg,Pos,god i wish i could sign a hundred million dollar deal and spend every day launching hilariously bad three after three
neg,Neg,on the cavs i wondered why we played other guys over larry nance now on the blazers i m wondering why they play other guys over larry nance
pos,Pos,i m mad about that elbow not getting a foul the ref was looking right at them whatever that wasn t the reason why they lost it sucks but they just didn t have it jjj and melt had bad games ja had an ok one and bane was great just need to be more consistent
neg,Pos,cj really has been playing like he wants to get traded for ben simmons
pos,Neg,jjj better start earning that contract extension
neg,Neg,they were all taller than us it was insane
pos,Pos,cavs won going 3 20 from 3 tall ball is coming for you
pos,Pos,welp looks like we re getting a warriors cavs finals again
pos,Pos,garland needs to be taking more shots
pos,Pos,if sexton and garland are gigantic defensive liabilities then the rest of our team must be the greatest defenders of all time
pos,Neg,they are large men larger than your large men
neg,Pos,game by game the cavs are allowing fewer and fewer points
pos,Pos,don t do this to me cavs don t give me hope
pos,Pos,east runs thru cleveland isn t a joke anymore
pos,Pos,my extremely humble take is that we might be the best team in the nba we can go bigger if we start using tacko fall as our sg
pos,Pos,with lauri markkanen as their primary defense in the past 3 games paul george was 6 of 20 for 12 points mpj was 4 of 14 with 11 points and deandre hunter was 2 11 with 8 points
pos,Pos,i never thought i d ever be tuning into games just to watch someone play defense
pos,Pos,evan mobley is disgusting lmao dude was clamping perimeter players and was just a complete force in defense tonight and has been all season
pos,Pos,that s three wins in a row against playoff teams
pos,Pos,who knew you could build an elite team defense with lauri markkanen playing the three all of finland that s who helps to have the absolute defensive monster of evan mobley on the floor too haha
pos,Pos,correct me if i m wrong but i believe only five players in nba history were on the all defensive team in their rookie season kareem abdul jabbar 22 years old hakeem olajuwon 22 years old manute bol 23 years old david robinson 24 years old tim duncan 21 years old none of them were first team all of them were second evan mobley could seriously flirt with it at just 20 years old no kawhi this year opens up a spot first team is probably out of the question but i really think second team is in play he s completely transformed the cavs defense defends the paint blocks shots guards the perimeter sticks with guys in space doesn t foul the footwork and the way he uses his body is so advanced for his age he looks like a multi year vet like holy shit i m in love with this guy
pos,Pos,ricky rubio is the mayor of cleveland and king of all the leons
pos,Pos,cavs have held their last three opponents to 38 from the field and 25 from 3 they did that against the hawks nugs and clips their defense is a problem right now
neg,Neg,cavs running 3 7 footers and it s working lauri is pretty solid on defense that is very surprising
pos,Pos,cavs may never lose again
pos,Pos,wow 79 pts seventy nine points in 2021 nba
neg,Pos,is it 1990 what the fuck
neg,Neg,sexland three towers lineup apparently succeeding though i hope this early success for the cavs isn t illusory like their good start last season
neg,Pos,pg with an off game though it s understandable since he mostly had lauri guarding him
pos,Pos,spooky szn
pos,Pos,tall ball is the new pace and space league fucked
pos,Pos,mobes is legit defensive iq ain t a fluke
neg,Pos,yeah you can give us the rings now
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,terrance mann is the most recent guard to realize how terrifying evan mobley s mobility is
pos,Neg,collin sexton 17 yet 85 of cavs fans think he s a sixth man
neg,Pos,what year is it
pos,Pos,kevin love and ricky rubio have really come full circle
neg,Neg,the east runs through the cavs tristan thompson was just a couple years off
pos,Pos,this cavs defense is really working also clippers really need 30 from pg to win
neg,Pos,cavs with 3 straight wins over playoff teams the first on the second night of a back to back the next two on the road
neg,Pos,collin sexton carried the offense and mobley is a one man wrecking crew on defense this is so stunning the cavs defense has been record breakingly bad at times the last three years and now are absolutely stifiling
pos,Pos,these cavs looking like fratello era cavs scores were in the 70 80 range
neg,Neg,damn cavs also started really good last year wonder if they can keep it up
pos,Pos,now the lakers gotta worry about these guys too
pos,Pos,if you re in the la area open your chick fil a app before 10 30am and redeem your free chicken sandwich cause jarrett allen missed 2fts in a row in the fourth
pos,Pos,lets goo
neg,Pos,i love mobley also kevin love looks to enjoy playing basketball again
pos,Pos,cavs look good especially on defense i m always cautious whenever it concerns cleveland sports especially since we tanked after a decent start last year but hopefully the org has decided we don t need anymore top 5 picks
pos,Neg,apparently whatever the blazers had was contagious
pos,Pos,a lakers fan was just walking through staples center concourse chanting lets go lakers bro did you not turn on the tv today
pos,Pos,this road trip is going better than expected
pos,Pos,california runs through cleveland gg longbois
pos,Pos,hi we re fun
neg,Neg,all aboard the sexland express
pos,Pos,oh how quickly they forget the league still runs through the land
neg,Neg,the cavs have beaten the hawks the nuggets and the clippers that s what happens when you have baby duncan and spanish jesus i guess
pos,Pos,lebron going home when he s a free agent cavs are hella fun to watch
pos,Pos,forget small ball tall ball is now the new wave
neg,Pos,tall ball cavs are fucking hilarious in concept but also great to watch also when did love go gray not that it makes him look worse
pos,Pos,dude mobley is gonna be a fucking beast for the cavs sexton garland mobley looking good
pos,Pos,lauri markkanen the paul george stopper reggie jackson blatantly changing his pivot foot 25 feet from the hoop in front of the entirety of staples center and not getting called for a travel perfectly summed up this game f refereeing tonight
pos,Pos,are we good
neg,Pos,evan mobley is a stud hes so good defensively inside and on the perimeter he moves very well
pos,Pos,in the offseason i thought lonzo was the perfect guard to fit with sexland glad to be proven wrong by rubio both the front court and backcourt are looking pretty fucking good we just gotta find a true 3 d wing
neg,Neg,low scoring games are always fun to watch
neg,Pos,the east runs through em what u expect
pos,Pos,lakers clippers nets and suns all suck bulls wolves cavs and wizards all flourishing lol
pos,Pos,that was the worst piece of shit i ve ever seen
neg,Pos,big is back
pos,Pos,the madness continues
pos,Pos,can t wait for the raptors cavs when the long bois tm meet tall ball tm
pos,Neg,this season is gonna be so weird i can feel it
pos,Pos,the cavs with their three 7ft players and a zone defense could really challenge for playin spot they re nice so far this season
pos,Pos,the east still goes through cleveland
pos,Pos,thank you cleveland thunder fans
pos,Pos,rubio is a god and i will always stand by that
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,the cavs have allowed fewer points in each consecutive game they ve played doesn t bode well for the lakers
pos,Neg,i miss tacko
pos,Pos,cavs are gonna be around 500 this year team is better than i expected future is looking better for the cavs
neg,Neg,must be nice to play consist level defense
pos,Pos,mobley blocking that jumpshot in q1 made me nut lol
pos,Pos,big ball baby
pos,Pos,thank you
pos,Neg,so many 3s in rubio s stat line
pos,Pos,viva el rubio
pos,Pos,i m a fan of the cavs and of florida state safe to say that i have the largest human beings playing at their respected levels i m for it
pos,Pos,the entire city of la is in shambles
pos,Pos,la clippers more like la 3 point missers
neg,Neg,dont get too high dont get too low remember with our best player its going to be rough on top of that our match up vs teams with quality bigs is our worse match up deandre defeated us jjj and steven adams hurt us today we had kevin love evan mobley and jarrett allen stop us they stopped jokic then shifty small guards is another weakness for us so sexland is an issue cavs are pretty much our kryptonite for sure i hope we can get to 500 by all star break though
pos,Pos,awful start would have been cool to see zu hartenstein together to match cavs height
pos,Pos,can t spell la without the l
pos,Pos,so what fa s can the clips realistically land in the 2022 summer or 2023 summer that won t have this core end up like the lob city team that didn t win it all
neg,Neg,today the oklahoma cavaliers defeated the lal clippers
pos,Pos,is mobley listed as a sf goddamn i kinda dig that three gigantic mfs in mobley lauri and allen holding it down
pos,Pos,pandemic p on fire going 0 8 from 3
pos,Pos,lfg
pos,Pos,we let ed davis get some run in on these clowns lol
pos,Pos,playoff started early for p
neg,Neg,clips really out here sucking ass
pos,Pos,this cavs team lookin kinda spooky
pos,Pos,at least the clippers are worse than the lakers lol
pos,Pos,glad to see lauri wasn t holding out on us i m sorry cavs fans be prepared to watch his potential for a few years and wonder how he can be so athletic yet so stiff at the same time
pos,Pos,damn and i thought the lakers choked
pos,Pos,kawhi was right board men do get paid
pos,Pos,the cavs are legit and the clippers are missing 3 starters as usual
pos,Pos,where was kahwi
neg,Neg,what the hell going on
pos,Pos,clippers have no d depth
pos,Neg,easy money
neg,Neg,trae and collins pnr was unstoppable all game yet they barely ran it
pos,Pos,67 points scored by ex lakers jeez
neg,Neg,fucking love sports ball
pos,Pos,wizards bed about to get some work this year
pos,Pos,no dinwiddie no gafford no problem holy smokes i havent seen a wiz team this deep in my entire fandom
neg,Pos,team is forreal really loving having an actual roster of genuinely talented players rather than 4 nba players and a bunch of random bodies
pos,Pos,the biggest upgrade we made was at head coach unseld is legit we re actually playing defense now and our late game offense actually consists of ball movement and motion
pos,Pos,81 1
pos,Pos,ben taylor made sure i know his name fastest whistle in the league for techs
pos,Pos,what we doin on the wizards bed tonight
pos,Pos,3 of tommy s acquisitions scored 20 points today lmao also ben taylor must be a part time cop
pos,Pos,southeast division is getting spicy this is gonna be a tough season
pos,Pos,lol the lakers gave the wizards a whole decent team
pos,Pos,wizards are looking scary tho ngl
neg,Neg,it s good for the nba when the wizards are good
pos,Pos,wizards bed tonight
pos,Pos,lakers with buyers remorse
pos,Pos,
neg,Neg,man lakers just gave us some top players for westbrook you love to see it
pos,Pos,the top 3 teams in the eastern conference record wise is the bulls hornets wizards man what the fuck
neg,Neg,is this how it feels to have a competent roster
pos,Pos,kcp trez and kuzma all scored 20 or more tonight it s early but the westbrook deal is looking like it s gonna go down as an all timer the wizards have so much depth now it s absurd we beat the hawks with no dinwiddie no rui and no gafford shout out wes unseld jr too scott brooks could never
pos,Pos,i would venture to guess there are people in the room that are familiar with the stories in the book of genesis where there was a time when the israelites were wandering in the dessert and all of a sudden bread came down from heaven that s kind of what today feels like for us to have kcp join rob pelinka the poet thank you lakers we have depth
pos,Pos,kuzma gets such a hard time on the internet for being a decent player
neg,Neg,what this season has told me so far is that the lakers depth the last few years was incredibly underrated kuz trez caruso and kcp killing
pos,Pos,how does one handle this success so far
pos,Pos,god i love the wizards
pos,Pos,ben taylor gonna cry in the car
pos,Pos,wwwwashington wwwwizards
pos,Pos,i m not crazy or anything but we goin 81 1 and we are fuckin on the wizards bed tonight
pos,Pos,we got a fucking squad now
neg,Neg,the most fun i ve had watching the wiz at the start of the season since 16 17
pos,Pos,wizards are the deepest team in the league
pos,Pos,who had the wizards being 4 1
neg,Neg,my husband started this season declaring the wizards would go undefeated and i think he may be close to right
pos,Pos,fuck ben taylor
pos,Pos,after years of the constant jokes your team name lol people saying we were a basement team play in at best they laughed at us laughed at us
pos,Pos,this has somehow turned into a westbrook hate thread lmao
pos,Pos,must be good day for former lakers
pos,Pos,it won t go down as an all timer because the upside isn t there but my god was the westbrook for kuz kcp harrell trade bad the wiz kids are ballin
pos,Neg,our team is so deep
pos,Pos,i feel redeemed after getting downvoted for predicting that the wizards will make the playoffs
pos,Pos,well you can t expect to win a game where you allow 4 of the opposing teams starters to score 20 i also see that huerter is trying to play himself out the rotation and thats fine considering cams there to take his spot
neg,Pos,beal looked like a rocket this game during his cuts drives
pos,Pos,oh shit so having decent nba players helps you win nba games the wizards front office may be on to something
pos,Pos,we haven t had a team this well rounded since 2015 i think
pos,Pos,wizards deserve a lot of credit happy to see them put out a good team on the other hand we look absolutely awful to start the season
pos,Pos,every time wiz win the other team complains lol yall stay up though gg
neg,Pos,i hate when i go to a post game thread and all i see is people complaining about the refs but that was one of the most poorly officiated games i ve ever seen
pos,Pos,my wizards
pos,Neg,all because ad didn t want to play center wiz aren t even in their final form just wait until former baby laker thomas better than zubac bryant comes back
pos,Pos,and the lakers fans were making fun of the wizards for the westbrook trade just few months ago lmao
pos,Pos,damn lakers got finessed stuck with weak ass westbrook
pos,Pos,top 10 anime trades
pos,Pos,i see you wiz
pos,Pos,it s almost like a couple good role players are more valuable than westbrook
pos,Pos,i don t think it s a hot take to say wizards are 100 going to win the superb owl
pos,Pos,wait the wizards are actually winning
pos,Pos,the real story of this game is the officiating worst officiating in a game i ve seen all season 5 technicals all for petty shit refs swollowed their whistle for literally everything except the play on the court game was slow as hell because of it they reviewed techs for 5 minutes each at least 3 times absolute shitshow scorebox doesn t tell the story at all and not to get it twisted the wiz also got some dogshit calls the officiating was shit in every direction thank goodness they have a rematch in a few days hopefully that game will be more fun to watch
pos,Neg,these guys couldn t score like this last season on the lakers now they all have 20
neg,Pos,it s still early but i would love to see the wizards competitive again
neg,Pos,wait what
pos,Pos,man getting all these dudes in the russ trade totally changed everything for the wiz they re really winning everything about the rockets dump
pos,Neg,i ve been saying the wizards squad is vastly improved they def got the better of that deal
pos,Pos,i guess getting 3 starter caliber players can make a team good who knew
pos,Neg,quite the difference compared to last years start for the wizards lol
pos,Pos,lakers down real bad kcp kuz caruso and trez are balling out meanwhile russ is a walking to and a brick machine
pos,Neg,wizards are better without westbrick good shitn
pos,Pos,this was allegedly a game of basketball
pos,Pos,that westbrook trade looking worse everyday
neg,Neg,ex lakers shining
pos,Pos,it s not fun to have b2b games the team that does that almost always loses easy money on bets but seems wrong
pos,Neg,let s go team lakers
pos,Pos,i have john collins on my fantasy team hehe
pos,Pos,damm the east is deep only like two shitty teams in the conference
neg,Neg,alright i feel just slightly better about my cs getting totally embarrassed by the wiz last night maybe they re actually good
pos,Pos,what s up with players balling once they get off bron s team
pos,Neg,being in the uk i have been picking up the earlier games earliest for me starts at midnight but also wanted to try watching more teams this season anyway it s quite rough watching my magic atm have to say i really enjoyed watching harrell play tonight has he always been such high energy just a beast was a fun watch will definitely be tuning in to more wizards game this season
pos,Pos,i didn t follow the off season i knew russ went to the lakers but they gave up kuz montrezl and kcp for him wizards won that trade
pos,Pos,half the wiz s best players are former lakers safe to say they won the trade at least so far
neg,Pos,wiz are hoopin
neg,Neg,the east is so good this year even teams i don t expect to make the playoffs or be real contenders are still really fun to watch happy for you wiz fans
pos,Pos,seth curry just adds 15hp to any team
neg,Neg,never thought i d feel this angry following a joel embiid step back 3 to end a game
pos,Pos,wish saddiq brought that a bit earlier almost had them
pos,Pos,i m sure we will win a game at some point i mean you d think
pos,Pos,i m starting to think ben was doing a little more than just running to the rim and 180 jump passing to guys and if he was only doing that then could someone else try
neg,Neg,of course the lions and pistons are the only defeated teams in their respective leagues hate them both
pos,Pos,in conclusion bey is bae
pos,Pos,sixers despite their record have had a bad start
pos,Neg,piston bros how s luke garza translating to the nba liked his game in college
pos,Neg,road to 0 82
pos,Pos,and they said it couldn t be done
pos,Pos,i thought the pistons were supposed to make some progress this year are they really this bad or is it just small sample too early injuries no cunningham yet etc
pos,Pos,process me the fuck up thats some good process right th ere right there if i do saү so my self i say so thats what im talking about trust the process me right now chorus process mmmmmꮇм нo0оଠｏooｏoоଠଠooooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ sam hinkie is my daddy
pos,Neg,drummond fouled out with 4 turnovers in 14 minutes only scoring two points so it s like we won right
pos,Neg,removed
pos,Pos,good
neg,Pos,wow congrats on beating a team you re supposed to sixers
pos,Pos,fun fact the rockets went on a 22 2 run and still lost by 30
pos,Pos,jazz bench low key kind of insane
pos,Pos,utah really about to fuck around and win 60 games again
pos,Pos,mod correction the utah jazz are currently 4 0 not 5 0
neg,Neg,so when utah says fuck the rockets its both figurative and literal now
pos,Pos,paschall and whiteside have been amazing the jazz bench is so friccin good
pos,Pos,7 players in double digits and 4 from the bench
neg,Pos,i love hassan whiteside and i don t care who knows it
pos,Pos,jazz off to another great start again looking good so far
pos,Pos,regular season utah jazz is too lethal
neg,Neg,paschall was hulking out a little bit
pos,Neg,start sengun
pos,Pos,regular season champions jazz picking up right where they left off
pos,Pos,it s strange to me that that jazz have the number 1 spot in the west but have had zero highlights posted to the sub i think the most up voted post is and tussle with whiteside keep sleeping on the jazz i guess snooze snooze
neg,Pos,apparently the jazz were so good they deserved 2 ws thought they should be 4 0 not 5 0
pos,Pos,jalen green is actually getting better but he just can t hit a fuckin 3pt shot
pos,Pos,it s so hard to watch this team night in and night out and not think we re gonna win the title if people stay healthy donovan s been poor in almost every game and we re still just steamrolling people hopefully the bulls on saturday will be a better test
pos,Pos,damn jalen green is chucking em haha
pos,Pos,jalen 3 16 says i just shoot like ass
neg,Neg,free john wall
neg,Pos,remember when rockets fans spent the entire off season clowning the cavs for letting kpj go
pos,Pos,7 guys in double figures double double for rudy nice
neg,Neg,how many teams this year will have a game where 7 players score double digits i am guessing less than 5 teams and that is a high guess jazz do this on the regular
pos,Neg,maybe we can be the best team to lose in the wcf this year let s go baby
pos,Pos,jazz going for number 1 seed yet again
neg,Neg,jazz have so many solid players what a core
pos,Neg,ftr
pos,Pos,who would have thought evan mobley and scottie barnes are better scorers than jalen green lmao
neg,Neg,jalen green s been super inefficient at high capacity the rockets are perfect for him
pos,Pos,3 16 i thought the other night was greens breakout game
neg,Neg,i actually miss losing to the rockets
pos,Pos,damn we suck
pos,Pos,harden is wildin
neg,Pos,what a game hurts to lose like that but a good game nonetheless
pos,Pos,basketball is back gg knicks
pos,Pos,yeah a 7 game series of these two teams is a must in the playoffs
pos,Pos,we didn t get they w but that playoff atmosphere baby
pos,Pos,this game fueled my narrative that a bulls knicks ecf would be must see tv
pos,Neg,last year if randle was having on off night we d often struggle but now he had a quiet scoring night with some impressive facilitating and we still beat a scary bulls team obviously a godawful closeout but our offseason additions and returning player improvement have looked great so far
pos,Pos,did i go back a couple of decades both knicks and bulls are good and they just had a tight game
pos,Pos,hell of a game but holy hell we need coby white back just to score
pos,Pos,
neg,Neg,gg knicks
neg,Neg,tough tough win just a fantastic game start to finish both these teams are absolutely the real deal i ve been thinking lately that it s possible that the latest rule changes may be ushering us into a new era of grit and grind basketball and i think this game was a prime example imo the teams that have looked the strongest so far this year and and most exciting to watch all have one thing in common mentally tough players that aren t afraid to play aggressive defense scrap for every board run you up and down on every play and drive on you in the paint and i don t think that s a coincidence
pos,Pos,rj deserves so much credit today he played against lavine so wonderful on defense today kemba walker was splashin 3s in the 3rd but they can t keep doing this to our hearts with the chopped cheeses halal food pizza and bagels our hearts can t take these stressful endings
pos,Pos,nothing to see here move along folks
neg,Neg,we tried our hardest to fuck that up jesus christ
pos,Pos,we had deblasio we had cuomo
pos,Neg,bulls knicks in the second round plz
pos,Pos,bing bong i guess
pos,Pos,rj heard all of you r nba
pos,Neg,that slide into an out of bounds is heartbreaking
neg,Pos,to say the knicks have taken a decade off of my life is a serious understatement
pos,Pos,the east is lit playoffs will be a bloodbath
pos,Pos,never in doubt tom brady is a fucking bitch
pos,Pos,every bulls knicks game is must watch now the effort at the end was amazing for the bulls though they re good
pos,Pos,omg my sweat is sweating
pos,Neg,ecf matchup lets go
pos,Pos,fuck my heart celtics game all over again
neg,Neg,let s call it a hard fought road win against a playoff team and leave it at that bing bong
pos,Pos,bulls announcers are elite btw a genuine joy to listen to
neg,Pos,the rest of the bulls knicks game are gonna be a bloodbath this year gg bulls fans y all have a squad
pos,Pos,rj fucking barrett
pos,Pos,i swear to god our bbiq sometimes just drops off a cliff they love to give me heart attacks
pos,Pos,derozen has slippers on
pos,Pos,julius just testing every inch of patience in my body
neg,Neg,thank fucking god
pos,Pos,knicks bulls hawks any combination of a series i want to happen for the next few years
pos,Pos,rj had that man locked up
pos,Neg,knicks with the immoral victory lol
pos,Pos,we need to learn how to close out games
pos,Pos,81 1 still in play for the bulls
pos,Pos,that was way too ducking close we have to learn to close out games
neg,Pos,dear sir or madam
neg,Pos,locked the fuck up lets go rj
pos,Pos,at least it was only one air ball to win it
pos,Pos,that was like looking into a mirror those two teams have so many similarities it was a good game knicks definitely gave bulls some good tape to review
pos,Pos,real good game for a solid chunk and amazing at the end bulls finally gave effort in the final minutes and we need that constantly got destroyed on the offensive glass and that s gotta change but i don t see that happening anytime soon tbh especially when we re running 4 guard lineups lmfao speaking of lonzo did fucking amazing on randle wtf gg knicks as heart attack inducing this game was i need a couple more because that was some physical basketball our shooting was also piss poor i can t wait to have coby back off the bench but we really need an interior presence
pos,Neg,welcome both sides to the 4 1 club what are we doing tonight
pos,Pos,knicks saved from a wolves worthy choke job
neg,Neg,i ve never met two teams so evenly matched bro holy shit
neg,Neg,why drose is not closing game is mind blowing
neg,Pos,demar tf you doin breh
pos,Pos,i simply do not know how you don t let lavine or vuc take that final shot
pos,Pos,christ alive this team will kill me
pos,Neg,randle saved by derozan i ll never understand the obsession with going to the iso when it clearly isn t working
pos,Pos,great knicks game till the last 2 3 mins what the heck too close a call
pos,Pos,thibbs bout to slap someone if they smiling in the locker room
neg,Neg,it was so satisfying to hear stacey king say pressure bust pipes following randle s missed freethrows only for derozan to airball the gamewinner
pos,Pos,we had de blasio we had cuomo it was rough shit we have the knicks
pos,Pos,the battle of anti clutch randle or demar
pos,Neg,did the bulls have a shot to win at the end how did it end
pos,Pos,we tried very hard to lose that game wtf
pos,Pos,my heart hurts such a great game but holy fuck do we make the last 60 seconds harder than they need to be gg bulls definitely playoff bound this year
pos,Pos,alright knicks gg see you in the ecf
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,our endgame is extremely questionable thibs needs to work on that and then his fucking rotation minutes
pos,Pos,is this the fucking 90s
pos,Pos,lolknicks at 1st place in the eastern conference just feels right not gonna lie and let s be honest with these upgrades they never stood a chance
pos,Pos,randle is painfully non clutch
pos,Pos,bong
neg,Pos,well that was an unfortunate time for an airball
pos,Neg,best julius in nba history
pos,Pos,wow what an amazing game playoff atmosphere type beat
pos,Pos,40 of our games so far have been heart attack inducing cardiac kemba is exactly as advertised
pos,Pos,it s okay bulls fans we been there
pos,Pos,i feel like this is the first time in my entire life the knicks are good and i m already annoyed with knicks fans lmao you guys are wild
pos,Neg,go new york go new york go go new york go new york go
neg,Neg,need sidetalk nyc reaction vid now
pos,Pos,i respect our teams ongoing commitment to make every game close whether we like it or not
pos,Pos,every bulls knicks game is must watch now the effort at the end was amazing for the bulls though they re good
neg,Pos,my girlfriend knows nothing about basketball but follows the knicks to humor me and she texted me after the game asking does it always have to be this stressful and i think that sums up the knicks perfectly gg bulls y all got an exciting team i m sure we ll be seeing each other in the ecf like the good 1 2 seeds we re definitely going to still be by the end of the season
neg,Neg,downvote me if you must but i d rather gotten kemba walker than russel westbrook
neg,Neg,derozan taking the shot over lavine is a failure in coaching how is it not a pass to vooch with the option to get it to lavine
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,r nba told me knicks are worse than the bulls knicks will be 8th seed thibs is a bad coach r nba is full of white teenagers with divorced parents
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,love you deebo but that wasn t the shot
neg,Pos,terrible fucking execution at the end of this game holy fuck thank god we pulled it out but what the fuck
pos,Pos,i m glad we got the win but julius should get an earful from thibs no way you should be trying to put that back after the o rebound just dribble it out
pos,Pos,why do we make a habit of blowing large leads with under 3 00 to go in the game
pos,Pos,hm this knicks team looks really good i wonder who they lost to
pos,Pos,almost a lolknicks moment
pos,Pos,got the w and the heart palpitations a true ny game
neg,Pos,that was scary close to being another lol knicks moment
pos,Pos,caruso please clamp for us again
pos,Neg,all these years of making defrozen jokes and the mf does it on my own team
pos,Pos,we just wanted to make it exciting for the nbatv viewers yeah that s it
pos,Pos,so this is how the raptors fans felt
pos,Pos,as with the celtics game i m just laying on the floor wondering how the fuck we just won
pos,Pos,rj all defense
pos,Pos,every round of east is gonna be a knockout fight east and west are both competitive boysssss im in for it
pos,Pos,so frustrating that the focus will rightly be on the end when we handled the bulls pretty damn forcefully almost the whole game really gotta clean up 4th quarter execution gg bulls bing bong
pos,Pos,god damn did we try to lose that thank god demar hesitated on the last shot
neg,Neg,obi needs more playing time
pos,Neg,let s go knicks
neg,Pos,don t even care about the loss okay care a little bit but whatever it was just so great to see the ol gang together again miss yo jo derrick taj and of course thibs hope we see you for 7 games in may
pos,Pos,on behalf of julius i d like to thank demar for that air ball
pos,Pos,i literally pulled over to watch the rest of the game what the fuck
neg,Neg,i don t hate the knicks but i m salty af hearing stephen a every damn time they win lmao
neg,Neg,alex caruso is the best bulls player since george gervin
pos,Pos,evan fournier is a fucking beast
neg,Neg,where bing bong
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,lonzo needs to step up a little more
pos,Pos,i was at this game and it loved seeing all the players from the rose era all in one place gg knicks it was a great game all the way down to the last shot
neg,Neg,this one gonna hurt for chicago their next 12 opponents are gonna show if they re real
pos,Pos,gotta wonder what woulda been if pwill wasn t beaten to death in q2
pos,Pos,the knicks are legit bruh
pos,Pos,randle was the best player on the bulls absolute garbage all night
pos,Pos,pass the fkin ball to zach
neg,Pos,all that effort for a comeback just to airball the game winner
neg,Neg,good thing it wasn t a 14 0 run
neg,Neg,can t put into words how hard we tried to lose this game
pos,Pos,fuck it bring back all the eastern rivalries
pos,Pos,randle really needs to step it up in high pressure situations we saw it last playoffs and we saw it just now
pos,Neg,knicks edging me like arsenal does this gonna be a great year
pos,Pos,sad we lost but just glad that we have big games like this again gg knicks
pos,Pos,what an awful shot and play call but a great game
neg,Neg,the east has become very fucking interesting to watch
pos,Pos,dream 4 5 matchup this year
pos,Pos,why did he pump fake just take the shot
pos,Pos,rip undefeated bulls oct 18 oct 28 2021 that was a nailbiter
neg,Neg,dear thibs burks doesn t know how to inbound the ball let rj inbound sincerely not blind human
pos,Neg,it s crazy how the top 4 from the east looks like something from the 90s
pos,Pos,taj with his lunchpail rose showing out and thibs yelling on the sidelines really took me back in the day knicks did their best bulls impression on joakim s night minus the shooting and bad fouls lol
neg,Neg,i definitely wouldn t mind seeing these two in the playoffs seven games of heart palpitating action
pos,Pos,dammit thibs you ruined our perfect season
pos,Neg,bong
pos,Pos,gotta make free throws
neg,Neg,20 points for barrett is pretty good
pos,Pos,ugly wins are still wins every team has them lottery teams and championship teams both the free throws and finishing will clean up for the knicks thibs and all these players who wants to work will see to that
pos,Pos,bulls and t wolves are my top 2 league pass teams right now everything about the bulls broadcasts are great from the announcers to the aesthetics of the arena
pos,Pos,tell me a lil something kd
neg,Pos,choke after choke at the end still good close game
pos,Pos,julius randle is absolutely gassed at the end of every game the massive minutes thibs demands from him surely take a toll and contribute to his late game struggles
neg,Pos,respect to the bulls i love caruso and lonzo is real impressive on d also lowkey wish we had zach lavine crazy how timber wolves let him go
pos,Pos,bing bong
neg,Neg,we da best
pos,Pos,honestly this loss this close against a playoff team feels more meaningful than chicago s four wins as far as saying hey this is a real team
pos,Pos,there were bad no calls throughout the game on both sides but regardless it was a great game
neg,Pos,man p will hurt zach with a bad hand and now first loss i was hoping it d atleast come against the jazz
pos,Pos,funny thing is the bulls have the best closer in college basketball in ayo dosunmu i wound have yolo ed and put him to close the game
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,first nba game i went to in years and i got an amazing one in a loss that hurt
neg,Neg,bad night for undefeated teams
pos,Pos,serious question would you rather have rj barret on your team or zion the answer s zion but it s closer than it has any right to be
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,like waking up in the 90 s again
pos,Pos,bing bong
neg,Neg,brunson is going to get paid
pos,Pos,shout out to maxi kleber with his six blocks
pos,Pos,the spurs are going to be the best one win team in league history by mid november
neg,Pos,we have two superstars and the rest of our team is trash trade everyone and build around jalen brunson and maxi kleber
neg,Pos,someone separate pop and luka they look too friendly are they talking in serbian luka s laughing i call tampering
pos,Pos,kleber turned into prime mutumbo on d tonight and i loved every minute of it
pos,Pos,after starting 3 10 luka made his next 8 lol decided to turn it on i guess shoutout maxi with the 6 blocks btw
pos,Pos,stealth tanking
neg,Neg,cuban better pay brunson someone might throw a big bag at him next year
pos,Pos,its only the 4th game of the season and i feel like i have aged 30 years
pos,Neg,we can t win even with a 20pts head start
neg,Neg,never doubted the mavs after the 1st quarter definitely didn t scrub my social medias
pos,Pos,how lucky the mavs are to be able to bring guys like kleber and jb off the bench stellar
neg,Pos,jb 6moty
pos,Pos,shout out to frank ntilikina for playing great defense and hitting a few shots he and kleber were huge for us defensively
pos,Pos,you thought you could beat the würzburg wall think again
neg,Pos,here s your dallas mavs post game summary now in our 6th season 6 did the mavs win kidd s 3rd win as the new mavs head coach mavs really started the game down 5 25 and proceeded to go on a 31 4 run luka had a really slow start to the game with not even 2 assists in the first half eventually started to get things going making 8 straight shots and finished with 25 3 5 after some solid games timmy had an off night only making 2 shots kp was out tonight with lower back tightness no word on if he plays tomorrow against denver yet doe doe with 14 8 with 2 steals and 3 3 s dwight with a solid 11pts 7 bench analysis brunson burner was the mvp for much of the game on offense with 19 7 5 knocking down 3 3 s to lead the bench in scoring maxi was the mvp on the defensive end tonight with some pivotal defensive plays all night finishing with a 12 10 double double all off of 4 3 s and a whopping 6 blocks frank with 6 4 in 13min knocking down 2 3 s gotta say this team has looked shaky so far on offense but our defense has looked much better so far hopefully the same case tomorrow but with better offense out of the gate against the nuggets
neg,Pos,that game was so weird brunson bailed us out in the first half so much
pos,Pos,it s like the crew said we have no one who we can trust to get us out of slumps lonnie is the closest we had to that tonight also 4th quarter doncic is unfair
neg,Neg,competitive tanking by the spurs keep games close but still lose
neg,Neg,kleber had such a great game 4 threes 6 blocks and 10 boards man was really doing it all
pos,Pos,things to like we strapped in and after being down 25 5 came back jalen is looking great if he can be a secondary ball handler and do 16 4 6 then that s what we need i ve said for over a year now he has the potential to be kyle lowry maxi looked great he won t do that every game but he always brings defense and can score the defense as a whole looked very good and has post hawks i saw deflections tipped balls steals blocks shot clock violations and even just really good man defense from guys that knocked the spurs out of rhythm luka shot pretty well besides god damn free throws we play again tomorrow but at our next practice each guy shouldn t be allowed to leave until they make 100 this is ridiculous if we were 10 14 72 we win this game by 10 points ugh the team still hasn t quite found their rhythm yet but we re 3 1 i ll take it
pos,Pos,i ll take an ugly win any day over an ugly loss
pos,Pos,i have never felt so uncomfortable with starting 3 1
pos,Pos,it would appear the ass dragons are in early this season every teams that winning or should win comfortably really dragging their ass us included
neg,Pos,i tuned into the game when the spurs were up 17 1 i guess i should ve stuck around
neg,Pos,god every single game we ve played pretty well ignore blowing the large lead but get handed the l in the end the tank rolls on
pos,Pos,we are 3 1 and played one good quarter this season so far i dont know if this is good or bad
pos,Pos,lmao we really shot worse from fts than 3pts
neg,Neg,one of the worst games i ve watched
pos,Pos,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray
pos,Pos,maxi was great powell on the other hand is just not good enough to play so many minutes
pos,Pos,hahahaha we almost beat you also lol we still have point differential
pos,Neg,some classic 19 20 spurs here nice
neg,Neg,i thought it was weird that they only played 3 quarters of basketball tonight but the mavs did good in all 3 of them so haha no harm no foul right
pos,Pos,brunson got them in this game luka brought it home man i have nothing against dwight powell but i am so fucking pissed every time i see him on the court why doesnt kid give a chance to the new kid brown he cant be worst than dwight he is not a guy for a starting line up hell i wouldnt put him on a second unit i dont know man 2 offensive fouls in last 5 minutes from him were dwight special but maybe its just me guys
neg,Neg,man dwight powell is fucking terrible
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,the okc thunder are sweating lol
neg,Neg,best 13 seed of all time
pos,Pos,i love the start dj and poeltl have made to the season vassell is improving and lonnie as well we know keldon is going to go through a learning curve as people have seen his tape from last year and game planned to stop him now that he is a big deal it s on him to use other facets of his game my biggest concern is derricks game he has looked out of sync to start the season we won t win any games if he does not join the party
pos,Pos,maxi and brunson this is a blowout loss without them tonight frank s defense played a big part in our 20 point comeback too
neg,Pos,ah yes free throws the hardest part of the game for both teams
pos,Pos,the bench vs the starters is kinda nuts if you didn t know about the first quarter kleber frank and brunson all 21 and up doncic thj and powell in the 15 and worse
pos,Neg,top 3 pick incoming
pos,Pos,betonchet
pos,Pos,bench luka ntilikina deserves the spot
pos,Pos,what happened in this game mavs were down terrible last time i check is jason kidd a good coach now
pos,Pos,lmao spurs blew a 20 point lead you must be terrible to do that
pos,Pos,dallas tried their best to lose that lol
pos,Pos,i feel bad for everyone who watched that abortion of a first half
neg,Neg,yeah i m no longer convinced pop gets to 26 wins this season we have zero closers and its going to lead to a lot of blown leads in the second half
pos,Pos,spurs playing a game called the floor 3 is lava
pos,Pos,we will be the best worst team and i m all here for it
neg,Pos,what the fuck was that last sequence by the spurs you re down 3 on a fast break with open teammates and you chose to pick up your dribble and got trapped and this is a 5th year player not some rookie i don t think i ve facepalmed so hard in my life
pos,Pos,we are the best tanking team in the nba
neg,Neg,practice your free throws kids
pos,Pos,what s up with all these 20pt comeback wins lately lol
neg,Neg,gotta pay brunson
neg,Pos,one of these days the spurs will win a game and you re gonna like it
pos,Pos,the trick around having triple dirks is that if one dirk is out another dirk will step up
pos,Pos,holy tunrovers luka c mon man
pos,Pos,i haven t been following the past week but for someone who has watched have the mavs pulled it together or are their opponents just playing terrible
pos,Pos,no lead is ever safe
pos,Pos,fucking end me back to back awesome bets tanked by bitchass teams blowing 20 point leads you ve got to br kidding me
pos,Pos,there s the spurs i m use too get a huge ass lead then shit yourself to the point you fucking lose like the trash you are holy shit the amount of people defending the same ol bullshit this team does year after year is fucking amazing
neg,Neg,blew a 19 point lead bruh
pos,Neg,someone needs to give the curb your enthusiasm treatment to the warriors announcer guaranteeing steph won t be held scoreless in ot after a donut in the 4th
pos,Pos,morant is cold that spin to take the lead to 3 was so nice warriors really fumbled with all those tos man some were just so dumb great plays by grizzlies in ot though
pos,Pos,the warriors last two losses in chase center were against memphis
pos,Pos,this grizzlies team really showed a lot of grit to grind their way back in and win
pos,Pos,mf got juked at the end lmao
neg,Neg,ja morant is unreal
neg,Neg,need a warriors grizz playoff series ja becomes mj vs them
pos,Pos,that long rest really ruined curry lol dude went cold cold
pos,Neg,well that was embarrassing we committed way too many turnovers and steph was once again scoreless after the 3rd gg grizz you deserve this one shy on the bright side we re still technically undefeated when moody plays ye let s go with that
neg,Neg,ziaire didn t show up on the box score but i was really impressed with him tonight showed flashes of elite defense and a glimpse of being able to create his own shot defensively with him bane and brooks we can be competitive on that end of the floor with anyone also about out to deanthony melton dude played out of his mind lastly damn ja
pos,Pos,we deserved to lose this one
pos,Pos,desmond bane was born in the darkness molded by it
pos,Neg,warriors commentators after curry goes scoreless in the 4th i guarantee you he scores in ot lmao
neg,Pos,idc if it s early i m here to co sign the ja morant mvp campaign
pos,Neg,as a russ fan i think i ve found my favorite player for when he eventually retires i love ja so much has so many qualities that i love in a basketball player also helps that russ is his favorite player lol
neg,Neg,turnovers and steph being 0 for 7 or whatever it was since the 3rd quarter killed the dubs tonight
neg,Neg,ja is so quickly becoming the most fun player to watch in the league
pos,Pos,curry went cold at the end which is bound to happen sometimes as always it s the turnovers that lost this game for us shoutout to lee though even though he didn t hit the last shot he had like 3 clutch triples this game
pos,Pos,23 fucking turnovers over 10 of them unforced shit is frustrating as fuck
pos,Pos,imagine blowing a 19 points lead couldn t happen to us lmao
neg,Pos,temetrius jamel morant shoutout to deanthony melton sticking with steph not giving up on that matchup
neg,Neg,that ja morant spin move on wiggins was lethal
pos,Neg,wwwwlarriors
pos,Pos,ja is on a revenge tour this season and it ain t stopping anytime soon
pos,Pos,such an embarrassing loss man that 14 0 run to undo all of our good work so many stupid ass turnover and from our veterans like steph and dray
neg,Neg,ja makes me moist
pos,Pos,crazy how ja can move so fast with testicles the size of cantaloupes
pos,Neg,that 8 second violation was dumb
pos,Neg,gsw plays the version of basketball where everyone in the team seems to know their role very well except in pressure situations if you re going to rely so much on curry that late in the game you re not going to win many close games regardless of how curry has played throughout the game edit props to ja lee and memphis defense in ot
pos,Pos,ja is getting all the attention and for good reason but desmond bane has been quietly very good in the absence of brooks 19pts on close to 50 40 90 shooting so far this season
pos,Pos,ja morant is literally steve nash derrick rose combined
pos,Pos,said it in the gt but yeah ja is the best 2nd overall pick since kd
pos,Pos,every grizz player except kyle anderson had a steal we ve got some dawgs
neg,Neg,welp warriors and bulls suck now
pos,Neg,ja is an incredible baller but he also became this team s entire identity in no time at all this feels like grit n grind reborn
pos,Pos,grizzlies should thank the pelicans for the draft
pos,Pos,nasty spin move at the end by ja
pos,Pos,i love this grizzlies team they have zero quit
pos,Neg,i got interviewed by some dudes in warriors gear with a camera outside chase center tonight since i was in a bunch of grizz gear and i made sure to tell them i was here to watch iguodala lose ja tore it up tonight and our smothering defense smashed the warriors really satisfying win really nice to watch iguodala who is still a bitch lose to the grizzlies
pos,Pos,what s the difference between a dollar and steph curry you can still get 4 quarters out of a dollar
neg,Pos,curry was bound to get cold after kerr put him in with 4 mins left he should have come in when draymond was put in
pos,Pos,grizzlies won a game in 2021 shooting 25 from 3 grit n grind ain t dead
neg,Neg,temetrius jamel morant is here to stay if you don t know now you know
neg,Neg,knew the 8 second violation was going to happen as soon as dray started slow walking it seem to be playing themselves into mental shape i guess
pos,Pos,ice water in his bane
neg,Neg,morant is too quick haha couldn t even foul him at the end of the game great start to the year for him the warriors super small lineup was not able to provide help at the rim and he just bbq chickened people 1 on 1 as much as i love andre i don t think he s a closing lineup type player at this age
pos,Pos,dubs played sloppy as hell with the to s kerr held curry out for way too long in the 4th and then chef just went cold af in the 4th ot too he was too passive imo should ve done what ja was doing and take to the lane
pos,Pos,saw this on the grizz subreddit and it just feels appropriate after each dub
pos,Pos,we get dillon brooks back and we can really turn up then
pos,Pos,god damn those turnovers
pos,Pos,grizz and ot wins in chase center name a better combo
pos,Pos,kerr really sat curry until the final 4 minutes in the 4th unbelievable just like the crazy amount of turnovers
pos,Pos,ja mvp stocks
pos,Pos,2 2 on the road trip we ll take it
neg,Pos,melton looked like prime ta tonight don t ask about his shooting tho
neg,Neg,i am so happy ja morant exists and is a grizzly
pos,Pos,very close to a 3 1 record on two b2bs with west playoff teams and wins against the clips and warriors i ll take it ja and grizzlies means business this season bane is a sniper too
pos,Pos,grizzlies now have wins over the best team in the west warriors and east cavaliers
pos,Neg,so close forgetting turnovers it was so good to watch grizzlies are dangerous off the boards and played a great game unfortunately steph came off the bench cold in the fourth i ain t mad tho damien lee put on a hell of a show and ja morant is a beast
pos,Pos,ja is real man
pos,Pos,ja is something else huh
neg,Neg,good shit griz ja is a god damn monster
pos,Pos,get in here grizz boys
neg,Pos,chase center runs through the grizzlies sorry i don t make the rules
pos,Pos,the grizzlies getting the pick and landing morant is looking like a major blessing disguise right now he s a top tier scorer and passer not to mention his fearless swagger is exactly what you want out of your best player once jjj gets right the grizzlies are gonna be legitimately scary
pos,Pos,bane mip this season for sure hype train is real also iggys still a bitch in my eyes and that was a sorry ass game by him curry is still the man
neg,Pos,i m 100 sure that someone has put a curse on curry man hasn t been able to score in the 4th quarter
pos,Pos,ja is making his case for a super stardom
pos,Pos,that 8 second violation pretty much summed up the game
pos,Pos,desmond bane
pos,Pos,kyle anderson moves like he was manufactured in a workshop and not conceived in a womb
pos,Pos,ja morant is who fox thinks he is so far this season
pos,Neg,ja
pos,Pos,fuck iggy party
pos,Neg,steve kerr definitely wasn t chasing wins tonight with how long he had steph on the bench in the 4th this team looks like last years warriors with how much they were getting outscored when he was on the bench in all seriousness though what the hell has gotten into steph the last few 4th quarters he was lighting it up the first 3 then just faded away dlee the reason the game didn t end in the 4th and ot was even close ja was insane in the 2nd half i pretty much wrote him off at halftime for having a bad game but he delivered for sure that deep 3 in crunch time was one of the best shots of the season so far this game has so many similarities to the play in game warriors blow lead with steph on the bench ja comes out hot in the 2nd half to force ot steph and warriors struggle in ot
pos,Pos,jjj locking up steph
pos,Pos,just here to pay my respects to the griz to come back from down 19 on the second road game of a back to back and win in ot damn them kids got juice
pos,Pos,why sit curry for 8 minutes in the fourth
pos,Pos,leggggggggoooo grizz great comeback and great defensive effort ja is a true star
pos,Pos,kerr holds steph out during a time out with 6 30 left doesn t end up getting him in until 4 minutes left already down by 3 it s such a dumb decision that he does time and time again you force him to come in that late and attempt heroics and then it doesn t work out and you actually just forced him to play an extra 5 minutes of ot
neg,Neg,not many teams make steph work harder than memphis he was exhausted at the end there
pos,Neg,so many turnovers
neg,Neg,fucking turnovers
pos,Pos,there are two times i watch flight reacts when tatum does something dumb and when the warriors implode
pos,Pos,i was honestly surprised by how unbiased the dubs broadcasters were
pos,Pos,thank you memphis for beating us hopefully the warriors learn that making that many turnovers will not always result in a win
pos,Pos,are grizzlies fans going to make it through the season without heart failure
pos,Pos,that 8 second violation is going to haunt me for a while gg memphis ya ll earned this
neg,Neg,ja morant looking like he could still play 5 pickups after the game wtf
pos,Pos,ja morant is a fucking stud holy shit
neg,Neg,ja making a serious run at mvp if this keeps up
pos,Pos,ja morant is a top pg in the west easy all star selection
neg,Pos,wwwwlarriors
pos,Pos,god damn the warriors played like they had donkey brains
pos,Pos,i love curry but this game is an example of why i m a bit lower on him than guys like kd once his 3 s aren t falling it s over no drives to the basket or midrange
pos,Pos,warriors threw that game away terrible shooting from steph he isn t going to be mvp with games like this and constant turnovers from the warriors for a team that wanted revenge on the grizzlies that was incredibly sloppy
pos,Neg,curry carried until he couldn t only help he had was lee everyone else had random points throughout the game the supporting cast and draymond were bad
pos,Pos,i hope curry reads all these talk shits lol he needs to be criticized with his 4th quarter performance s
neg,Neg,ja is quick asf
pos,Pos,ja is on some mvp d rose shit this year he s insane
pos,Neg,ja morant might be the most athletic player in the league
pos,Neg,gg griz fans you guys matchup with us extremely well
pos,Pos,man steph was just ice cold at the end there when you re hot you re hot and when you re not
pos,Pos,happy as larry the way we played last night at portland was bad but we managed to pull ourselves out of it and get back to winning
pos,Pos,but why draymond
pos,Pos,too many turnovers again they won t keep getting away with it as today showed
pos,Pos,the turnovers were hands then the dubs will be yoshikage kira
pos,Pos,ik curry played shit in the 4th and ot but why did kerr sit him till the 4 min mark is that when he normally comes in
pos,Pos,all credit to the grizz ja is a flat out baller this game made me realize the dubs are a pretty lucky to even be 4 1 every game so far has just been very up and down need to find a way to sustain throughout 4q curry is not it either
pos,Pos,bruh you don t win with 30 turnovers was really hoping poole would have a revenge game i also think dray one can t be scoring only 4pts good game grizzlies fucking love ja tho dude is a beast i can see him winning mvp one day
neg,Pos,even if it is curry you can t make him sit in the bench for 10 mins and ask him to win the game at last
pos,Pos,ja morant
pos,Pos,so kerr once again letting the hottest player get cold with almost 7 straight minutes on the bench then said cold player shoots us out of the game with his mamba mentality
pos,Pos,man our turnover problem is staggering especially considering we definitely play really well when we aren t giving it away grizz played solidly but i think we win that easily in reg if we don t do things like commit unforced 8s violations when the game is tied
pos,Pos,lose by 3 points in overtime in your first loss of the season must be trash
pos,Pos,ja rule got us tonight good stuff grizz
neg,Neg,this game felt a lot like last year there are no real offensive options on this team other than steph curry lee can get hot from three from time to time but just not reliable enough wiggins is not reliable down the stretch never was if steph gets cold it s over same shit different year myers needs to make some moves
pos,Pos,on the other hand look at how bad the warriors had to play to lose by one possession in overtime
pos,Neg,if ja played gs for 82 games he d be 82 0
neg,Pos,it s just careless basketball by the warriors
pos,Pos,ja morant and the gang are exceeding expectations im glad to see them doing so well ja was unjustly overshadowed by zion who is severely overhyped
pos,Neg,steven curry needs more help maybe sign 5 6 superstars in their prime
neg,Neg,poole should have played for curry in ot
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,can t win em all it s fine onto the next
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,blazers confirmed better than gsw
pos,Neg,bleck
pos,Neg,ja got major bde
pos,Pos,left curry out too long he cooled right off
pos,Pos,so youre saying warriors lost because of warriors
pos,Pos,that game was over when draymond walked up an 8 second violation
pos,Pos,grizz really have the dubs number huh
pos,Pos,say what you want steph had a great game any time he gets off 29 shots it s a win in my book
neg,Neg,ja morant got ball control skills to go with that bounce and layup game superstar incomingggggggggg
neg,Pos,how does draymond only score 4 points in 37 minutes
pos,Pos,the good deantony allen the bad jaren parsons jr the glorious kyle blocks iggy to seal it
neg,Neg,warriors scheme last night was a russian roullete fast pace all time draymond basically decided he is an old ben simmons with no offensive threat whatsoever being wide open and not even a threat on the perimeter a lot of off ball movement and antecipation pass which caused a shit ton of turnovers this game remember me a lot of there matchup in the play in and again wiggins isn t treated as the second scoring option after steph which was already tired love him so much to say he choked
pos,Pos,box score kinda tells the tale gsw needed more o in the end hard to win when you just got 3 players in double figures 1 of which being a bench player
pos,Pos,gsw with so many dumb turnovers like draymonds 8 sec violation in clutch time lol
pos,Neg,you can t spell defense without gtj
pos,Pos,scottie v suggs show was pretty good both played up to the hype
pos,Pos,that banton dude is one of the steals of the draft so far
pos,Pos,i like fred s quote of the league is in good hands good games from both picks as it should be there
pos,Pos,shoutout to mo 40 minutes 18 rebounds 0 fouls bamba
pos,Pos,jeremy lamb ptsd on that last shot lmao
pos,Pos,well it s official after tonight s game we can stop the debates and declare a winner cole anthony is better than malachi flynn
pos,Pos,nah that was some dope shit tho gg raptors we will both be very good in three years
pos,Pos,if that last shot went in i think i would have went for a long long walk great game by all the rooks cole anthony lit us the fuck up
pos,Pos,turns out scottie barnes and jalen suggs are both good basketball players who knew
pos,Pos,gary trent being our defensive savior is not something i would have expected going into this year
pos,Pos,was not expecting banton to be this good
neg,Pos,fans chanted barnes is better and then orlando went on like a 10 0 run including a 4 point play from suggs lol i can t wait for pascal to come back
pos,Pos,suggs and barnes both scored 21 points on 14 shots will these two be tied together for the rest of their careers
pos,Pos,cole anthony may be playing the 3rd best basketball of the 2020 draft right now
pos,Pos,both rookies impressed of course our crowd almost jinxes the game and pushes suggs into having his best game yet lol
neg,Pos,man close game all the rookies showed out wagner suggs barnes banton sick class so far
neg,Neg,damn suggs left his heart out there all it needed was a half court game winner guess he gonna have a raptors chip on his shoulder for a while
pos,Pos,people trashing fvv in the match thread here you fucking go this is fvv no touches with no service but when he does get it it s done
pos,Pos,star boy you beautiful beautiful man
neg,Pos,scottie great suggs great and we get to watch them for the foreseeable future everyone wins
pos,Pos,once again we can t seem to handle or pass the ball without turnovers guess you gotta deal with that when you have a really young team glad suggs had a good game had a feeling he would against toronto it was fun watching him and scottie go at it gg raps
neg,Pos,the karma was instant for that chant at suggs
neg,Pos,holy shit what a fucking game back and forth and competitive an amazing showcase of barnes and suggs
neg,Pos,cole anthony is a fucking problem
pos,Pos,i m here to talk about our defensive lord and savior gary trent jr
neg,Pos,tbh the bench saved our ass magic bench is currently the 3rd stringers they actually aren t as bad as you d expect once they get back isaac fultz and okeke
pos,Pos,game notes scottie barnes may arguably be the best rookie in the league but dalano banton might be the best 2nd rounder suggs is the truth stop hating on that young man almost beat our ass single handedly dragic getting no pt is great for the team let our young guys develop gary trent jr is scary when he gets to the rim and these steals are amazing averaging 2 5 on the season chris boucher finally had a good game mo bamba is officially good at basketball this season cole anthony will be the bane of our existence one day dj augustin vibes
pos,Pos,scottie killed it in the first half and suggs killed it in the second both are special
neg,Neg,this team just makes me happy man not the most talented raps squad i ve seen but probably the most hardworking and tenacious so satisfying watching 5 guys giving maximum effort at once
pos,Pos,can t wait until we have fultz isaac and chuma back we always give up leads when we go to the bench
pos,Pos,gary is that dude i m so happy rn
pos,Pos,gg cole anthony was fucking legit
pos,Pos,suggs almost put us to bed after those scottie better chants hopefully that ll teach this fanbase to stop obsessing about him hopefully
pos,Pos,suggs revenge game goddamn that was too close would have been so embarrassing
neg,Neg,my heart was racing that last minute tf
neg,Pos,that was unnecessarily close
neg,Pos,tough shooting night for wagner but all the rooks on both sides looked pretty solid overall
neg,Pos,og almost gave suggs the revenge game also wtf is up with this team scottie legit had like 4 or 5 shots in the 2nd half we aren t gonna win games ignoring the guy shooting the best and scoring the best on the team
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,great showing from both suggs and scottie there will be no shitting on jalen this game raptors fans
neg,Neg,gary trent jr can deflect me anytime
pos,Neg,gtj fvv and barnes can have my kids
neg,Pos,gtj defense ftw
pos,Pos,glad scottie and suggs both had good games
neg,Neg,both suggs and barnes played great can t be disappointed with either pick
pos,Pos,og u need to chill bro giving me heart palpitations tf
pos,Pos,gtj making a clutch defensive stop to save our asses from total humiliation was not on my bingo card for the season gg magic
neg,Pos,great game by both teams and the rookies looked like a flagrant foul on that last suggs three a very similar one was called in the first half but oh well still an exciting finish
neg,Neg,this raptors team is going to be tough for most teams as they are very good defensively and lots of very reliable shooters on the roster as well
neg,Neg,magic young players playing good and a loss for the tank win for them honestly
neg,Neg,damn obviously wanted the win but still love to see the top draft picks putting on a show tonight can t wait for the next one gg s raps
pos,Pos,i m so hyped for the magic s future if suggs can become more consistent and franz can continue to do what he does and take steps next year and we get a high draft pick which are all possible we will be solid in a couple seasons all we need is kelle and ji back because we got shooters now
neg,Pos,scottie barnes 13 and jalen suggs 7 sorry raps fans but this debate is settled
pos,Pos,barnes and suggs are so good
pos,Neg,jalen suggs is a demon in the clutch that kid is special man wagner hooping too my fuckin heart is still pumping these scottie games are starting to feel normal which is crazy back to 500 lets go
pos,Pos,hopefully this ends dumb raptors fans clowning on suggs to hype barnes up it was embarrassing then and even more embarrassing now
neg,Pos,close one boys
pos,Pos,gary trent jr saved the game
pos,Pos,gtj s hustle on defense to get those steals has definitely been on display the last few games
pos,Pos,gary trent jr is tony allen with a jumpshot
neg,Pos,scottie that is all
pos,Pos,scottie and dalano are the truth wild how they look like the most composed out there for a good amount of the game s o to suggs for having his best game
pos,Pos,man cole anthony is really good
pos,Pos,man raptors fans really show out on reddit man there are 100 comments in 4 minutes on a random raptors magic post game thread in october
pos,Pos,that was closer than it should have been barnes could have hit 30 if teammates actually passed him when he was open instead of the constant hero ball suggs almost won orlando the game after the trashy fans started the hate chants keep it positive unless it is pat bev the refs were decent this game
pos,Pos,jeremy lamb nearly entered the chat at the end
pos,Pos,last possession gave me ptsd of jeremy lamb
pos,Pos,scottie barnes
neg,Neg,great game magic should be a good match up for years to come
pos,Pos,anthony cole blew that final play but man he has flashes of greatness he will get there
pos,Neg,gary trent defense in insane
neg,Neg,was a good ass game
neg,Neg,gtj got them quick hands
pos,Pos,og not ready to close yet i guess
pos,Pos,gtj with the clamps
pos,Pos,barnes and suggs both went off these gon be special
neg,Pos,got ptsd from the jeremy lamb game winner when cole anthony took the shot
pos,Pos,i knew suggs was gonna suddenly find his shot against us lmao
pos,Pos,i feel like since orlando had the momentum they shouldn t have called a timeout at the end there
neg,Neg,as someone who has watched some magic games in passing but hasn t been paying super close attention how big of a jump has this been for bamba this year orlando fans it feels like he s a damned good mip candidate from a distance
pos,Pos,fuckin gary what a pest
pos,Pos,who called time out i suppose mosley magic were blazing hot and had a 1 vs 1 in transition with 7s on the clock if you dont find the angle plenty of time to call a time out have to trust your players there
pos,Neg,good game magic bros suggs sure is spooky
pos,Pos,i m convinced barnes is a legitimate roy candidate front runner
pos,Pos,c mon toronto fans the scotties better chant is totally classless suggs wanted to be a raptor not his fault you guys didn t draft him between that and cheering when kd got hurt not great looks for raps fans
pos,Neg,og has to be better in those final 2 minutes really let us down there lucky to get away with the w
pos,Neg,scottie barnes will win a mvp one day
pos,Pos,raptors fans better not say a fucking word about gary trent jr cole anthony or jalen suggs after this game lmao
pos,Pos,hell of a game by both rookies way too early to say one is better than the other
pos,Pos,shoutout scottie and gtj i m really glad suggs had a good game he needed it he was looking like killian hayes for a minute both rookies will be great players
neg,Pos,nothing wrong with scottie is better chant he is better than other guy for sure suggs seems okay but not on scottie s level scottie just forced one half and dropped 19
pos,Pos,i don t know what it is about raps fans on reddit but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the barnes is better chants man some of you people here are so ridiculous and think that fans can t have fun cheering and everyone has to be nice to each other get outside nerds it s just for fun
pos,Pos,raptor fans are embarrassing
pos,Pos,this game was so stressful magic start hitting some wild 3s to get back in the game
pos,Pos,gtj clamps
pos,Neg,orlando had probably their best shooting night of the season fvv and og sucked for 3 quarters still won hats off to the magic they have some decent prospects suggs is no barnes but he looks like he ll be a solid pg in this league
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,starter vs starters we are better but our bench outside of ross is ass
pos,Pos,banton suggs
pos,Pos,i m upset
pos,Pos,damn i thought eric thomas was jordan peele for a hot second there
pos,Pos,not even close bby my mini heart attack at the end means nothing great to see both of the rooks getting along and playing fantastically think both teams really got one this draft class is too legit
neg,Neg,gary trent jr with the absolute brilliant and critical defence at the end also banton is looking better and better each game barnes and banton are going to be a problem
pos,Pos,the raptors tried their hardest to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
pos,Neg,where is the other half of the magic roster
pos,Pos,gary trent jr putting the clamps on in crunch time as literally every raptors fan predicted
pos,Pos,wait i missed the last few mins of the game how did it get close raps were up by 10 when i had to step away
pos,Pos,suggs was amazing
neg,Pos,i love scottie barnes hype trainnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn woo woo all aboard
pos,Pos,orlando the new knicks
pos,Pos,i said after last game that piston and rocket fans must be a little nervous since barnes and mobley look so promising i was told it was to early well is it still too soon mobley and barnes look amazing
pos,Pos,been saying this since summer team to beat in the east
neg,Pos,so bad it s like magic heyoo
pos,Pos,raptors 11 steals magic 1 steal
pos,Pos,i can t believe we re the only team that lost to orlando
pos,Pos,suggs was thriving in the clutch hitting 3 s looked fast as hell with the ball and he was locking up raptor players as a raptor fan this looked like the guy that i fantasized about drafting after reading all those mock drafts that had him at 4
neg,Pos,i look forward to the eventual suggs green barnes super team
pos,Neg,d rex finished a game woooo
neg,Neg,we almost lost this game in the last 2 mins gut wrenching
pos,Pos,genuinely curious is jalen suggs a candidate for roy
pos,Pos,erik no
pos,Pos,defense wins championships and games
pos,Pos,mo bamba is a monster wtf
pos,Pos,trade you guys bol bol for gary harris back
pos,Pos,good lord torontos rookies play big minutes
pos,Pos,can someone else lose to them so we re not their only win
pos,Pos,no excuses why orlando should lose they should have won these fourth quarter turnovers ruined it again the orlando magic offically are the worst team in the nba i want this franchise to crumble they will relocate to montreal to stu sternberg
pos,Pos,miami is scary
pos,Neg,man miami that defense holy shit
pos,Pos,score 100 points against the heat challenge not so fast nba
neg,Neg,man i m so excited for our offense to click once kyle and duncan get their rhythms back this was a good test i honestly think last season s team would have ended up losing this one but we were able to keep steady and stop the comeback heat culture is back on the menu boys
neg,Neg,heat defense looks outstanding right now i would really like to see lowry score more but if you have bam herro jimbo scoring 25 each you don t really need that herro has looked like an all star level player this season coming off the bench no less with only 1 mild game so far
neg,Pos,tyler herro is a fucking bucket
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,bam has been playing some of the best basketball i ve ever seen from him
pos,Pos,this heat defense kyle lowry getting into rhythm on offense will be a serious contender to make it out of the east i m not sure they aren t already a real contender man they made us look like kids at times bam is legit jimmy is legit tyler herro killed us i will say the hornets 2 years ago or even last year would have absolutely just given up glad to see the team actually have some fight up until the end gg heat y all earned that
pos,Pos,apologize to tyler herro
pos,Pos,heat dando pan con pinga
pos,Pos,butler is casually dropping 30 point games now that he doesn t have to play point guard all game he finds so many creative ways to attack opposing defenses bam is grabbing damn near every rebound now too and herro could be an allstar off the bench if miami is the 1st seed headed into allstar break easy 6moy
pos,Pos,heat are legit contenders duncan robinson shooting like prime rondo and their still beating teams handily once the shooters get going it s gonna be scary
neg,Neg,alright kyle and duncan nice prank guys now please start hitting shots again
pos,Pos,heat hold the offence in the league to just 99 points love to see it
pos,Pos,heat remain perfect when lowry plays
pos,Pos,jimmy tyler and bam really are the big 3 love them all to death especially tyler of course
pos,Pos,i ve seen enough bam is the greatest center of all time
pos,Pos,60 37 total rebounds lol
pos,Pos,herro comin for 6moy
pos,Pos,heat look dangerous af and herro is starting to look for real
neg,Neg,go up by 26 in first half lead gets cut to 4 in the turd quarter win by 15 and hold team under 100 classic heat game
pos,Pos,tyler leading 6moty so far surely game has slowed down for him so much bam and jimmy were absolute beasts today
pos,Pos,this team is dangerous as hell especially when jimmy butler is playing like this
pos,Pos,tyler herro is the type of guy to take a screenshot of all the hate comments on his ig and read it before every game for motivation
pos,Pos,tyler hero is who jordan poole thinks he is
neg,Pos,another outstanding win i still have my reservations our 3 ball has been piss poor if we were 1 4 instead of 4 1 i m pretty sure duncan and lowry would be piñata s in our sub dunc s is understandable every team that pays their 3pt specialist will get frustrated with them on an off night bkn joe harris was davis bertans etc but i hope lowry gets going eventually he hasn t scored 10pts in a game for us yet kinda reminds me of mike conley s woeful start with utah a few years back at least he can contribute in other aspects regardless bam s a rebounding machine herro is an electric scorer off the bench and i love markieff morris
neg,Neg,good shit from the hornets you guys are a great team and i look forward to playing you three more times you caught us off guard last season but we won t underestimate you again
pos,Pos,where the herro haters at
neg,Pos,max strus with the 22 in 19 minutes
pos,Pos,look i m not gonna say herro is as good as trae and luka but he s not that far behind let s be 100 honest guys
pos,Pos,when jimmy s landing those ugly flat arc jumpers it s all over
pos,Pos,i hope our ownership is ready to go deep on the luxury tax because if tyler keeps going like this he s going to get paid
pos,Pos,tyler herro
pos,Pos,heat fans what s the take on lowry right now i have seen bits and pieces of games and he seems to playing well facilitating defending well but his stats look pretty bad
pos,Pos,herro has receipts on everybody
neg,Pos,tyler herro 6moty is gonna make me so much money i am lakers fan but man do i want tyler herro to have 50 point games against us
pos,Pos,i need the people who said jimmy would average 15 from the new rules to come to the stage
pos,Pos,this should be a blowout throughout the game if duncan doesn t have that shooting slump
pos,Pos,apologize to herro please and thanks
pos,Pos,tyler herro is my dad
neg,Neg,19 rebounds flex on em bam
pos,Pos,y all talked a lotttta shit this offseason that s all imma say maybe a lil too much shit oladipo getting healthy in the background spooky szn
pos,Pos,the heat is on
neg,Pos,the heat will never lose again
pos,Pos,that heat defense is nice clamps for real lowry was exactly the guy we needed at that pg spot
pos,Pos,we heat fans are going to be more insufferable than usual this year
neg,Neg,23 rebound difference between both teams so the end score is really no surprise what is a surprise is how close it all got at times
pos,Pos,hornets are an off season away from taking a big leap in the east they have some solid young talent
pos,Pos,herro revenge 6moty and mip szn
neg,Neg,gg hornets miles bridges is soooooo fucking good
neg,Pos,4 1 it s lit
pos,Pos,we ve improved so much as a team if this were last year we d probably blow the lead and lose by 3
pos,Pos,i like the heat s rotations start a defensive lineup and put in herro as a sixth man to change the pace the miles bridges breakout is real however the hornets will only go as far as lamelo will take them
pos,Pos,herros on a mission to prove this sub wrong
pos,Pos,duncan played like total shit jesus christ good w though
pos,Pos,we looked tired in the 3rd the back and fourth timeouts in the fourth got us enough rest to play defense again
pos,Pos,man when you have butler bam and herro all playing lights out basketball what do you even do
neg,Pos,the return of the turd quarter but that first half was phenomenal bam should win dpoy mip all nba
neg,Pos,i really like what bridges and gordon brought to the table bridges started off slow but kept attacking when it would ve been easy to throw in the towel in the end i hope hayward can stay healthy too he s another one of those players that just do so many little things on the court
neg,Pos,charlotte lost the moment they traded monk
pos,Pos,southeast division gang rise up
pos,Pos,1 point gawd dam plumlee
pos,Pos,i really wish we had a good defensive center
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,if duncan and lowry ever remember how to shoot the heat are going to have a hell of a season
pos,Neg,in his last three games lamelo has only 1 more made field goals than turnovers
pos,Pos,at one point the heat had 25 rebounds and the hornets had 24 points
neg,Neg,lol lamelo
pos,Pos,u bootum lamelo lowlights or no
pos,Pos,so how long before herro starts
pos,Pos,lamelo has been fucking awful the past 2 games 3 14 and now 2 14 incoming 1 14 vs the blazers on sunday
pos,Neg,sooo herro last season is lamelo of today
pos,Pos,the heat just needed another star and they are in great shape their finals appearance was somewhat lucky but the foundation for greatness was there i think this team will be a serious contender
neg,Pos,is this crossover episode
pos,Neg,miami kennel
neg,Pos,lowry adds so much to this team no jimmy can play his game just ball out doesn t have to facilitate or play pg bam finally realized this year he can dominate the boards lol tyler is balling out like all of us heat fans knew he could defense is fucking unbelievable so far we re spooky
pos,Pos,man i hope we get miami vs bucks part 3 in the playoff
pos,Pos,if we can get that kind of consistency from herro every night he ll not only get the start over duncan but he ll make his first allstar team and get that contract he wants
pos,Pos,who ever took the over on wins is a smart person wish i got it in in time
pos,Pos,herro is pretty good
neg,Neg,melo off to a bit of a slow start
pos,Pos,will terry mesh well with this team oubre is doing great at sg so far not sure who would start
neg,Pos,doesn t mean shit if kyle lowry can shoot 2 10 go 0 4 from 3 and score 4 points in 36 minutes and still come out with a 11
pos,Neg,lamely with 6 pts lamelo
neg,Neg,death taxes and lma s middy
pos,Pos,everyone thinks the nets need kyrie for his offense but they actually just need him to hug kevin durant on side lines to calm him down kd looked pissed all game lol
pos,Pos,did james harden stop being fat
pos,Pos,harden with the biggest fuck you to r nba lmao 19 fta
pos,Pos,wtf was kd doing after the 1st quarter lol 6 7 and then takes 3 field goals the rest of the game and looked like he wanted to get rid of it as fast as he could whenever he touched the ball also subbed out kinda early they won anyway but the only time i remember him playing like this was games 1 2 against the clippers in 2019
neg,Neg,lma midrange is so money
pos,Pos,wanamaker played great for the nets tonight
neg,Neg,torrey craig can t win with these cats
neg,Pos,fuck them rules james harden
neg,Neg,kd should have been tossed
neg,Neg,the return of dr foulci halloween comes early
pos,Pos,19 free throws damn
neg,Neg,harden had more free throw points than field goal points lol
pos,Pos,rumors of harden s demise were premature
pos,Pos,narrative boom
pos,Neg,after a brief interruption in programming free throws are back on the menu boys
neg,Neg,joey please get your shit together
pos,Pos,nets have officially passed the pacer test
neg,Pos,19 fts lmfao
pos,Pos,harden scored almost all his points on fta
pos,Pos,19 free throw attempts lol
pos,Pos,harden is top 5 i know it pains a lot of you to admit that though
pos,Pos,this team fucking sucks make a trade break up turbonis trade lamb for a second in 2030 idgaf anymore this team is so risk averse they won t even consider not playing brad because they think that s too much of a risk
pos,Pos,the beautiful game
pos,Pos,harden haters in shambles
neg,Pos,refs had to work overtime to get that ft disparity under control in the 4th lol
pos,Pos,only took 6 games for the zebras to revert back to the old ways harden must have used his blackmail materials
pos,Pos,the new officiating rules had a solid 10 day run
neg,Neg,respectfully to all the harden fans coming out of the woodwork he made only five shots so take your top 5 agenda and stick it somewhere else insert not in my book copypasta here
pos,Neg,harden is a known commodity
pos,Pos,la 10 points from 20k
pos,Pos,my man craig 28 pts miss him in denver
neg,Pos,i was told james harden was washed
neg,Neg,a lot of bullshit calls and you could see the frustration on the pavers faces doesn t excuse all of the missed good looks and still lacked communication hopefully we take some good lessons and hard earned feeling from this game it s always good to play against the greats to learn and grow gg nets
pos,Pos,kd shoulda been tossed but got star treatment
neg,Neg,harden stock reversal
pos,Neg,harden heard y all talkin shit
neg,Neg,harden is back
pos,Neg,wait but i thought this sub said that harden was exposed and couldn t get to the line with the new rules what happened so fucking dumb lmao
neg,Neg,harden doubters in shambles
neg,Pos,pacers 1 5 is that something ben simmons can turn around
pos,Pos,
neg,Neg,didn t watch did they refs just give into harden or are people just hacking him since he wasn t getting calls
neg,Pos,kd probably should have been ejected but this isn t the first instance of that part of the rule not being enforced this year can t remember which game but embiid kicked the ball into the stands by mistake as he was trying to kick it up to his hands i think he got a tech for that but no ejection despite how the rule is written there must be some allowance for lenience interpretation
pos,Pos,lol harden s diminished ability to get to the line was greatly exaggerated
pos,Pos,we are over 500 can you can believe it
pos,Pos,again with the needless fucking stress at the end
pos,Pos,boo we stink
neg,Pos,3 road wins 3 teams that almost came back to beat us but at least this time it wasn t because the kings fell apart new orleans just suddenly started draining 3s fortunately we hit all our free throws to seal it
neg,Pos,hope kings make the playoffs they deserve it
pos,Neg,man the kings are a competent coach away from being a solid team tbh the talent is there
pos,Pos,buddy is just looking so great off the bench it feels like every shot is destined to be a bucket plus the first really solid game from fox this year
neg,Neg,y all must ve forgot
pos,Neg,most impressed with holmes and haliburton tonight barnes too but i m desensitized to his solid production lol those are some quality pieces and multiple of them so rare for us lol fox looking better but still trying to snap out of it and figure out these foul calls i m still very confident he ll figure it out and he did plenty good out there just has to get in rhythm he s so out of it he s made some sloppy plays losing the ball on the drive in the 4th which definitely was less common last year edit 20 points off the bench from buddy might have helped too this dudes gonna win sixth man trying to get traded from us lol
pos,Pos,i appreciated the pels announcer s bring pissed at the constant pick and roll cooking
pos,Pos,y all remember when that clown mod on here was saying something about the holmes deal not going through when we resigned him in the off season
neg,Neg,man i miss zion
pos,Pos,rooting for the kings this year man this is the year they see the post season
pos,Pos,hot take these kings making the playoffs if they stay healthy
neg,Neg,that boy buddy showing the lakers what they missed out on lmao
pos,Pos,the kings are making the playoffs this year let s go
pos,Pos,why did the mavs get rid of harrison barnes
neg,Pos,bi deserves so much better i feel awful
neg,Neg,hali looked great tonight buddy thriving off the bench holmes being rock steady wish fox was more efficient but hey wins a win
neg,Neg,fuck valanciunas and fuck the refs
pos,Neg,so how is tyrese looking i ve seen the box scores but has he been playing well
pos,Pos,buddy gunning for that 6moty award
pos,Pos,herb played well tonight had his share of fouls but is really impressive in his role
pos,Neg,looked like a bubble game with that attendance
pos,Pos,i hope the pelicans fans i constantly argued with last season who were begging for more naw and kira lewis minutes are enjoying this season so far
pos,Pos,with each l i pray this season leads to griff being fired
neg,Pos,am i the only one who was kinda wishing bagley even got limited minutes he was working hard with rico over the break its one of those situations where i trust the organization over myself but do i actually after all the missteps
pos,Pos,imagine losing to the kings
neg,Neg,len getting minutes over bagley and thompson
neg,Pos,z should request trade
pos,Pos,i feel like haliburton is being held back
pos,Pos,can t believe i sat through the entire thing
pos,Pos,don t have anything at all to say this was one of the worst games i ve seen in a long time
pos,Pos,bones and bol putting in some work
pos,Pos,everyone is missing the most important thing to happen tonight at one point there were 3 j greens on the court at the same time
pos,Pos,seeing frank and trey on the field together down 30 reminded me of the old days
pos,Pos,29 5 as a team is fucked
pos,Pos,now accepting phone calls for bol bol 1 all star and 3 first rounders minimum
neg,Neg,hopefully the mavs can pick up some nba players to play with luka by the trade deadline
pos,Pos,our offense is all jokic but at least his teammates move around him that stand and watch luka offense is something else high iq move by kidd our d has been so solid this year love that gordon shutdown luka
pos,Pos,close one
pos,Pos,why in the flying fuck did mavs hire jason kidd jesus christ
neg,Pos,jokics a monster
neg,Pos,outscored by 21 in the third this was a terrible outing hopefully our worst game of the year
pos,Pos,twitter blaming scott foster for a 31 point loss lmao
neg,Neg,mavs need a new coach or a new roster this is not a great pairing
pos,Pos,the mavs are in a really bad spot they have a few solid role players but their core behind luka is just not good unless luka takes his game to another level this year and he s already playing at an insane level i really think they re capped at a first round exit they need another legitimate star player and multiple other quality two way players
pos,Pos,we really hired jason kidd smfh
pos,Pos,worst beatdown of the year already and it was to a team that had deep playoff aspirations that mavs roster really sucks
pos,Pos,mavs for real look like shit it s not as obvious since they have a winning record but their 3 wins are against the raptors rockets and spurs
pos,Pos,that third quarter was wowza
pos,Pos,anytime i check mavs boxscores i laugh at the cast the mavs have had the last 4 years all random dudes who cant do anything
pos,Pos,typical nuggs bball dominates playoff teams then struggles to a tanking team
pos,Pos,that third quarter yikes
pos,Pos,our entire team forgot how to shoot over the summer
pos,Pos,ol ol
pos,Pos,bones check bol check munder by 25
pos,Pos,gordon is our defender on george lebron and doncic in the playoffs oh and giannis too
pos,Pos,munder
pos,Pos,there s munder and then there s munder
pos,Pos,m
pos,Pos,31 second half points goddam kidd what have you done to one of the best offenses in the league
pos,Pos,best offense in the history of the nba for two years hires jason kidd 75 points against a team missing their second best player
pos,Pos,really didn t understand why analyst were praising this team before the season started like no way you improve going from carlisle to kidd
pos,Pos,to the guy who said the mavs vs spurs yesterday was the worst game he ever saw i raise you this
pos,Pos,shoutout to josh green who managed to be 10 while playing 17 minutes
neg,Pos,i m wondering if not being able to bait fouls has really hindered luka s offense he seems passive probably knowing he won t get the same calls wondering what type of adjustments he makes if he can start hitting his step back 3 more consistently that should help open his game up a bit more
pos,Pos,wow the nuggets gave the mavs a deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep one
pos,Pos,where s tingis the tin man hurt already what a surprise
pos,Pos,it s only five games but luka is having a relatively slow start to his season averaging 19 2 7 4 6 2 just shows how crazy his numbers were the last couple of seasons that those are considered sub par it s not like his usage is down much either 34 so far compared to 36 last season
pos,Neg,wow denver up 31 after 3 quarters
pos,Pos,lmao i ll always remember those mavs fans talking all that shit when the porzingis trade happened this is karma team so bad even luka is showing regression
pos,Pos,how long until luka asks out of dallas
pos,Neg,75 points jeez that has to be the lowest scoring game in at least a couple of years i don t remember the last time i saw 80
pos,Pos,i have really icky feelings about the mavs
pos,Pos,tim hardaway jr revenge game
pos,Neg,lowest scoring performance of the season so far
neg,Neg,i m still a bit surprised denver got austin rivers off the clearance shelf
pos,Pos,mavs gonna fuck around and get trade me now from luca
pos,Pos,i know jason kids sucks but i m fairly confident his game plan wasn t go hit 29 of your shots might be more than 1 problem
pos,Pos,so anyone wanna recap what happen
neg,Pos,free luka
pos,Pos,isn t it great that we fired rick and hired a wifebeater and a shoe salesman isn t this great
pos,Pos,trade luka i said it first
pos,Pos,damn kidd stopping goat prospect right here
pos,Pos,damn maybe andrew raymond managed to out nugget the nuggets
pos,Pos,completely atrocious shooting wow
neg,Neg,say the line luka
pos,Pos,portland 3 0 when lillard doesn t shoot 0 8 or worse from 3
pos,Pos,it was literally pg vs the blazers all game
pos,Pos,me in the 1st q if you re 5 8 you re good enough to block nurk me in the 4th q not to overreact but we seem to have the best big man in the league
pos,Pos,portland has the most exciting garbage time players in the nba
pos,Pos,eric bledsoe since shooting 10 16 in the opener has shot 8 32 in the next four games he brings a lot to the defense but offensively he s been terrible he s gotta get benched after this game
pos,Pos,dame finally looking like his old self
pos,Pos,the line was portland 3 they covered
pos,Pos,man in the middle of the game i had the munchies and got a bag of gummy bears and right as i sat down the announcers started talking about gummy bears and being a gummybearologist and it freaked me out bad
pos,Pos,gimme that big pick
neg,Pos,paul george is gonna break his back dragging this team to playoffs
neg,Neg,first time the blazers have beaten the pg kawhi clippers
pos,Pos,norm blocking zubac was sick
pos,Neg,unfair to play them 5v1
pos,Pos,our offense outside of pg is cold af our support needs to step up
pos,Neg,gg blazer bros
pos,Neg,that felt very nice
pos,Pos,nurk with 17 rebounds inject this into my fucking veins
pos,Pos,if simons hit those shots he normally does this is a 30pt blowout
pos,Pos,my blazers got the win but i don t think i d enjoy a series against the clips
pos,Pos,i am straight up not having a good time right now
neg,Neg,paul george is incredible
pos,Pos,scrolling down the first thing i see is paul george negative 10 and go oof then i read the entire statline damn pg is ballin
pos,Pos,the curse has been lifted
pos,Pos,my friend and i have an ongoing debate of who s better zubac or nurkic he s convinced zubac is better am i crazy or
pos,Pos,avenged
pos,Neg,thanks dame
pos,Neg,gg
pos,Pos,terence mann got paid at the right time this summer
pos,Pos,get pg some help but unironically
pos,Pos,waste of a great pg game this should be their wake up call to put more effort from the beginning and not 30 minutes into the game they literally had 1 point for the first half of the third quarter start mann bledsoe comes off the bench make reggie take less shots
pos,Pos,bledsoe what ru doing
neg,Pos,clippers are so undersized without kawhi morris and serge seems like lue is running sets as practice waiting for them to return pg is gonna get tired
neg,Neg,paul george can t win with these bums
pos,Pos,how tf did pg close a playoff series with this squad
neg,Pos,this game answers the question if paul george has himself mvp worthy season can clippers get high seed
neg,Pos,i despise this team
pos,Pos,clippers being bad is good for the leauge
pos,Pos,clippers really gonna get a no1 pick to add to pg and kawhi
pos,Pos,this clippers squad sucks so much outside of pg and kawhi
pos,Pos,clippers contending window is done
pos,Pos,woof
neg,Pos,pg cooked portland announcers talking about pigeontoed hops
neg,Neg,pg is a beast
pos,Pos,what happened to reggie he looked like the next mvp last playoff
neg,Pos,carmelo really feeds off the energy in staples the crowd gets electric whenever he touches the ball and you can tell he loves it
neg,Neg,better 3pt shooter logo bron melo or dwight
pos,Pos,i like evan mobley i like watching the cavs play intense basketball against good teams again i don t like whatever lamar stevens was doing on offense tonight i missed okoro garland gave the cavs the lead with 7 51 left in the 4th and after that the lakers absolutely took over that game like a championship level team should it wasn t pretty but lakers fans should be happy with how they closed that out i wanted the win but i m glad this team finally has an identity they re young and i think they learned a lot from this one
pos,Pos,evan is so goooodddd
pos,Pos,who knew lebron at point and ad at 5 shooters works so well
pos,Pos,lebron a star roll man and 3 shooters is still the best possession in basketball ad at the 5 is really a cheat code
pos,Pos,howard this season from 3 100 curry 38 5 howard curry
pos,Pos,wow i can t believe lebron ad pnr with a sniper like melo on the same side of the pnr results in a good offense
neg,Pos,i can t believe someone really said that russell westbrook is just a smush parker on adderall
pos,Pos,i just wanna say evan mobley is
pos,Pos,dwight howard better 3pt shooter than lebron
pos,Pos,russ had a great efficient game he ll keep getting better as he figures out his role on offense
neg,Pos,when melo is on one hes so fun to watch
pos,Neg,i really enjoyed this game for 3 quarters hahaha and then the lakeshow slammed slammed the door shut the experience and poise showed a thing of beauty even if the result totally sucked for me
pos,Pos,credit to the cavs they have legitimate talent hope to see them in the playoffs this year so they can get some experience under their belts
pos,Pos,as a rockets fan i love jalen green but damn mobley is a monster
neg,Neg,what i have taken from the last two weeks lakers need to limit switches and play more zone d when they do this they are successful the russ reaves melo baze ad howard lineup is a good one and has good chemistry the bron russ melo ad howard lineup is going to be deadly once they do 3 things 1 primary ball handlers lear to attack off ball 2 players are okay responding to other players routes without clogging the paint and catching mismatches 3 they settle more into the pass attack balance there are a lot of iso players who are so eager to fit into the new system they are sharing the ball too much and causing turnovers this happens and it s a wrap
pos,Pos,dwight howard hit a 3
pos,Pos,i really appreciate how cool headed lebron is when closing games out it s fucking masterful
pos,Neg,finally we beat a team by over 10 jesus it took long enough
pos,Pos,i thought monk was out since he wasn t playing much apparently monk wasn t playing well so ab took his minutes today the lakers have a lot of players that can get minutes so this unselfish mentality is crucial
pos,Neg,dwight with the iconic three
pos,Neg,austin reaves is very solid defends well passes well hustles hard makes open shots i wonder why he went undrafted
pos,Pos,lakers with deandre jordan 2017 lakers lakers without deandre jordan 2020 lakers
pos,Pos,guys the lakers figured out that ad at the five and lebron running the show is good
pos,Pos,melo was an amazing pickup he s the type of instant offense i feel the lakers have been missing the past few years
neg,Neg,cavs fans i really need to know if lamar stevens is usually this bad he was bad offensively and defensively i was convinced cavs wanted to lose by them playing him
pos,Pos,avery bradley 30
pos,Pos,the oldest starting player for the cavs is lauri who is 24 allen is 23 sexton is 22 garland is 21 and mobley is 20 the young core is young and very good this cavs team has a lot of potential
pos,Pos,beautiful basketball in moments once things click in about 2 weeks provided there are no injuries lakers are going to be amazing to watch
pos,Pos,we collapsed lebron and ad were the ones that turned it around but melo caught fire too
pos,Neg,garland and mobley on the cavs those two kids are ones to watch
neg,Neg,mobley on a fast track to superstar
pos,Neg,never heard of austin reaves before tonight but i like the way he plays
neg,Pos,carmelo anthony is a joy to watch when he s on fucking swished most of his shots tonight lebron looked rusty shooting but every time he goes to the rim it s money in the bank russ had his good moments tonight and was important when lebron went to the bench in the third he had some stupid passes that were saved by his teammates in the 1st but he improved from there if he plays like he did tonight the lakers will be just fine ab was great on defense reeves had some solid minutes although he committed some mistakes but he s a rookie it s natural ad might be averaging 28 12 but in certain games it just feels like he s not that guy i guess injuries have affected him and it might take a while for him to trust himself again him sharing the court with another center clearly doesn t help though vogel should never ever play ad and dj together the lakers looked like a high school team with those two and actually good simply with ad mobley looks fantastic
pos,Pos,melo might actually climb to 7th all time in points at this rate
pos,Pos,austin reaves literally took over caruso role 0 but these game are sad
neg,Pos,road to champions 79 3
pos,Pos,honestly they got better and better as the game went on they just need more reps together
pos,Pos,aight who s got the dwight 3 highlight
neg,Pos,after an ugly and shameful turnover filled first quarter lal completely turned this game around and never looked back lebron and carmelo were our two best players solid contributions from russell westbrook avery bradley and anthony davis dwight howard and dj were so important in gaining those second chances buckets to help us keep the lead positives focus and effort for the last 3 quarters very strong defensively in the fourth carmelo anthony and lebron dwight howard hit a three negatives we still need to defend the pick and roll better we need to start the game sharper and relax on our turnovers
neg,Neg,carmelo may not be the player he once was he might be bad on defense he might not be an offensive juggernaut anymore where you can dump him the ball and expect points no matter what but carmelo anthony will win you ball games them s the facts
pos,Pos,russ being efficient and starting to do more off ball lesshgo
pos,Pos,i m glad we have evan mobley and darius garland
neg,Neg,evan mobley is different
neg,Neg,someone upload that dwight dagger
pos,Pos,aint no way lebron losing to the cavaliers
pos,Neg,the panic was widely overrated
neg,Pos,aside from the obvious where the lakers need to reduce turnovers my biggest takeaway from this game is that they need to move the ball more on offense they end up playing iso too much and putting themselves in a bad spot they also need to shore up the help side defense on pick and roll coverage from a fan perspective because of the way they play and rely on transition their offense defense swing together if one is good the other is good too if one is bad the other is also bad this results in bigger runs and swings than usual and some patience is needed unlike a lot of people i don t have any particular issues with any players or lineups the lakers run most of their major issues extend towards multiple players changing one player s role in the rotation does not fix or explain their issues i d still give it a lot more time before hitting the panic button the cavs had their share of cold streaks and turnovers too partially due to good laker defense in spurts especially in the 4th so lakers were able to pull it out after a back and forth game interesting bradley took all of monk s minutes this game not sure if it was because the team played so bad in the 4 minutes he was on the court or if it was because he was sick bradley has more than deserved all his minutes so far though lebron s cold shooting night from 3 was offset by melo s super efficient 24 after a brief first half stint also westbrook had a nice efficient game 3 early turnovers in q1 and only one more the rest of the game and shot 8 13 for 19 6 5 lebron was actually the bigger culprit with 7 turnovers and 1 10 from 3 end of the 3rd and the 4th quarter was great to watch and reminiscent of the 2020 lakers team with their defense very encouraging for the lakers
pos,Pos,wonder what would happen if we just ran the following lineups in a cycle lebron ad pnr 3 shooters russ ad pnr 3 shooters russ dwight pnr 3 shooters bron dwight pnr 3 shooters and just legit spammed pnr the entire game
pos,Pos,if the cavs can somehow turn sexton into a ball handling wing then they can do something special
pos,Pos,cavs blew the game at the end
pos,Pos,played like the better team for 90 of the game and then fell apart at the end questionable coaching decisions down the stretch and just god awful refereeing to boot what an annoying game
neg,Neg,something tells me this post wouldn t get upvoted dwight is the real stretch 5
pos,Pos,imo russ was actually more contributing to the win than bron was and arguably the best basketball was played with bron off the floor however when russ and bron did click it was downright awesome
pos,Pos,ad at the 5 is going from hall of fame to rookie mode honestly if they just needed 30ish rs mins of c from players who aren t ad so he can stay fresh for the playoffs i don t understand why they couldn t make it work with marc who woulda at least spread the floor lakers need to clean up their turnovers bron ad russ turning it over is like whatever can t have 7 coming from monk dwight melo reaves
neg,Neg,solid win for our structurally unfit squad melo is looking lovely off the bench cannot wait for us to have nunn tht ariza and ellington in the in the lineup
pos,Neg,cavs played well the first half but the offense just died in the second can t just be standing around hoping someone else is gonna do something and just dreadful shooting lid on the basket is an understatement
pos,Neg,as a lakers fan and a usc trojan tonight was a double win for me
pos,Pos,loved seeing us play defense again
pos,Pos,it s funny when you realize austin reaves is the best player on the lakers
neg,Pos,cavs offense is tough to watch missed like 10 straight good looks on offense and they dont utilize the garland mobley action enough
pos,Pos,we won a game
pos,Pos,fucking me7o
neg,Pos,avery bradley with 30 though sheesh
pos,Pos,hbk is fucking great
pos,Pos,avery bradley with 30 somehow
pos,Neg,why did rubio shoot so much in the 3rd lol
pos,Pos,damn melo get it
pos,Neg,stupid turnovers and poor execution in the 2nd half cost us this one also melo going straight flamethrower mode on us didn t help
pos,Neg,dwight steph curry howard at the end
pos,Pos,don t let the melo haters fool you melo is the 4th star
pos,Pos,400 comments lol haters were starving last night
neg,Neg,this team looks so much better than last years even in losses
pos,Neg,ed davis is still in the league damn i remember him being one of my favorite players on our roster lmao
neg,Pos,lakers a couple missed free throws from 0 6
pos,Pos,looks like refs dictating games hasn t stopped
neg,Neg,i really stayed up til 1am to watch cleveland blow the 8 5 and have a dwight howard 3pter be the dagger also jallen 100m is toughhhh mobley already better 6 games in
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,im not someone who hates on lebron but i really wanted to kill myself when he shot that 10th 3
pos,Neg,wtf is wrong with cedi is he injured he should be traded if he s not playing
neg,Neg,dwight with the 3
neg,Pos,old man team turning it up in the fourth hell yeah
pos,Pos,dwight splashing in a 3 in the dying seconds didn t get a block this game is he even permitted a 3
pos,Pos,carmelo anthonnnnny
pos,Pos,ab with the 30 game second highest 11 honestly no idea what the rotation is going to look like with reaves and bradley playing so well monk seems like he might lose minutes which he won t be happy with considering he took a paycut to be with the lakers somebody tell me how baze gets minutes guy is not completely average or below on both sides and has no iq not to mention nunn ellington coming back lakers should pump up trade value for the guards then trade for better wings
pos,Neg,man as much as how big of an improvement kuz had while he was with the lakers i wished he played somewhat like how melo was playing of course kuz might be better for that role because of his improved defense and hustle on the glass when he s locked in hopefully melo could sustain this efficient scorer off the bench role
neg,Pos,sign bradley for the rest of the season he proved his worth
neg,Pos,we win games when melo is hot
pos,Pos,dwight and melo was our best 3 point shooters
pos,Pos,reeves was locked in defensively whole night
pos,Pos,this game was up and down only at the end of 4th quarter he could finally guess whos gonna win
neg,Neg,lebron hit 1 3 pointer out of 10 and it was from miles out
neg,Neg,oh my cedi
neg,Neg,can t wait for mobley s further development the man is already a menace
pos,Neg,why is mobley listed as a small forward
pos,Pos,lebron made 1 of 10 three pointers the only one made was from the logo lol
neg,Neg,man i fucking love melo when he plays well
neg,Pos,so is cedi not good
pos,Pos,avery bradley with a 30 lmao
pos,Pos,never seen a team insist on not playing their obvious best lineups as these lakers unbelievable
pos,Pos,lakers finally getting their head in the game
pos,Pos,they lost the first quarter and won the next three exact opposite of what happened in okc
pos,Pos,staples center melo
pos,Pos,guess draymond and curry was right about avery at least in some game
pos,Pos,lebron took 10 3s lol
pos,Pos,mobley s a beast
pos,Pos,melo went 6 8 from 3 again is amazing
pos,Pos,sucks
neg,Neg,russ when okc scored at the end with the lead when shit like that happens i don t let it slide there s certain things you just don t do in sports game already over and i didn t like it simple as that russ when his team does the same thing beautiful 3 tho
pos,Pos,can t wait for the pelicans are going to have a top 3 pick thanks to the lakers takes to come out again the next time we lose
neg,Neg,austin reaves is already a good nba player
neg,Neg,wizard bed gonna break at this rate
pos,Pos,those last two celtics plays from a time out were truly awful
neg,Neg,how bad was scott brooks
pos,Pos,that was some high quality shit basketball down the stretch wild card refereeing relentless hero ball and even in some bonus turnovers sprinkled in
pos,Pos,get in the damn bed
pos,Pos,kuzmania is here with the double double 17 pts and 17 boards chu gonna do when the kuzmania run wild on you brotha
pos,Pos,can we argue that this the best team bradley beal has had in like 5 6 years
pos,Pos,ever wondered what it would be like if two competing mafias paid off both teams to lose without being aware of each other
pos,Neg,went from cursing kcp to vowing to name my first born after him in about 2 minutes
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,kcp s redemption arc lasted for 10 seconds
neg,Neg,bruh your username is aggressive
neg,Neg,really rude of the celtics to have a rock fight with out smart
pos,Neg,celtics playbook 1 tatum iso that s about it
neg,Pos,3rd time in our history stating 5 1
pos,Pos,that was some ugly shit lmao what a game tatum has some ai level chucking games
neg,Neg,what an ugly game to watch if celtics hit any 3 s they should ve easily had this one watching dinwiddie and beal waste so many possessions driving to the basket without any ball movement is exhausting
pos,Pos,we need new sheets boys the fuckin bed is getting used
neg,Neg,what an absolute shitshow of a game celtics going 0 20 from three both teams playing hero ball all game last minutes of overtime belong to the refs i refuse to even call this game basketball
neg,Neg,i m straight up not having a good time right now
pos,Pos,5 1 let s go haven t been this excited for my team in a while
pos,Pos,insane game simultaneously incredible and sloppy as hell if the celtics shoot even 20 from 3 that s a blowout by them but they were insanely cold and covered super well by the wizards genuinely one of the best aspects of this years wiz team compared to previous years is their defense of guys from beyond the arc it s night and day
neg,Pos,thought we d face the hornets in the finals but hey we ll take what we can get
pos,Neg,house calling bill simmons as we speak
pos,Pos,one of the worst game endings i have ever seen in my entire life
neg,Pos,2 26 from 3 gotta be a record
pos,Pos,between the field goal drought and the sheer amount of butterfinger moments that first ot had me anxious af glad we could leave that trainwreck 5 1 let s keep it rolling
neg,Pos,double overtime what the fuck washington is back
pos,Neg,and the wizards don t even have hachimura active yet either
pos,Neg,was going to hunt down kcp and burn him at the stake until that game winning steal
pos,Pos,man both teams really wanted the other to win
neg,Neg,if kcp would have fouled brown on that after throwing the ball away i think i would have drove to the liquor store
pos,Pos,new york washington being 5 1 and beating boston in 2ot
pos,Pos,yeah everybody knows that the east runs through the checks notes wizards and knicks
pos,Neg,that was an interesting game imo
pos,Pos,man i feel for celtics fans losing in double ot again do early in the season damn
pos,Pos,why is zion on the cover lol
pos,Pos,i really really don t like the celtics announcers
pos,Pos,celtics sub a different level of toxic rn but the end of game plays are awful tatum is like pg like you can just expect like 8 10 games a year where they shoot like 5 26 celtics fanbase is going insane saying trade tatum for a game in october i had no expectations for this year as the bucks nets hawks heat knicks bulls were better coming into the szn
pos,Neg,kyle kuzma looking like dennis rodman this year
neg,Pos,can t remember the last time i saw a team play so poorly yet i still thought they should have won
pos,Pos,that fucking username
neg,Neg,wizards have been surprisingly good
pos,Pos,tatum was wizards best player tonight
pos,Pos,that was aggressively hard to watch
pos,Pos,haven t been this exacted for a wizards team in a long time lfg
pos,Pos,one of our ugliest wins in recent memory that being said 5 1 lets go
pos,Pos,damn wizards good this year
pos,Pos,this wizards team is sick
pos,Pos,the wizards are 5 1 oh my
pos,Pos,orgy in the wizards bed
pos,Pos,stark contrast between a kuzma led team and a tatum led team
pos,Pos,if you told me last year the wizards would be a better offensive team than the celtics i would call bullshit jalen and tatum seem incapable of running anything other than iso some quarters its both of them running iso of each other and they are not good enough yet to pull it of consistently they work hard for every point they get so it s no mystery they always look gassed and uninterested by the fourth idk what is the head coach doing because this is the same issue they had last year
pos,Pos,it s getting close to time to put bill simmons on suicide watch
pos,Pos,what an ugly win good game celtics
neg,Pos,kuzma playing good when he can just play his game
pos,Pos,celtics need to give brown the ball more tatum ain t it kuzma s been impressing as well as trez
pos,Pos,i was at the game voice gine very lit
pos,Neg,if bill simmons is having a bad time then i m having a good time
pos,Neg,can the celtics stop going to overtime
pos,Pos,my dude spencer at the top of the league
pos,Pos,came for the comments and thanks yall for not disappointing
neg,Pos,granted both teams played like shit however you look at this wizards roster from top bottom it s not bad for an eastern conference team kcp trezz dinwiddie and kuzma can definitely help beal
pos,Pos,was at game tatum and brown combined for five measly assists in a double ot game they do not play together and take turns at hero ball one on one very boring and will not serve them well was also quite gross how many boston fans were in the stands
pos,Pos,offense was terrible today but that weird coach s challenge call really turned the momentum
pos,Pos,easily the worst celtics team i ve seen in years defense looks sloppy low effort and subpar coaching
pos,Pos,what are those shots where you like take the ball and you re behind that arc thing and you shoot it and it goes in and they give you three points
pos,Pos,rip schroder s career
neg,Neg,tatum is shit godamn 10 32 bruh
pos,Pos,i ve lost all respect sorry this is absolutely rigged for money or ratings in not sure which i won t be silent just saw it live sry edit i really expected r nba to not get wooshed by an nba meme lmao
neg,Neg,cry about the refs some more the only questionable one was the overturn and that was still a good decision to challenge wizards win 5 1 thank you come again
pos,Pos,when will we be respected wizards beeedddd leettss gggooooo
pos,Neg,wiz should make a move for tatum he and beal seem like they really want to play together and it s clear boston isn t gonna compete with this squad
pos,Pos,my boy kuz balling
pos,Pos,celtics getting destroyed you love to see it
pos,Pos,celtics fans out here bitching about the refs when they scored 3 points in like the last 8 minutes of the two overtimes go tell enes to send a tweet to the refs
pos,Pos,funny as fuck seeing these players traded for russ playing good
pos,Neg,tatum is wildly overrated and people need to start realising it
pos,Pos,great game from the wizards celtics we will see you guys on thursday looking forward to it
pos,Pos,i haven t watched the wizards at all yet how is avdija doing
pos,Neg,2 26 on 3 pointers 7 that s just terrible
neg,Pos,tatum 10 for 32 what are you doing bro
pos,Neg,boston needs a pg to control the game bad
neg,Pos,i mean i know it s too early to get a full sample size and get a solid projection of how our season is gonna go but holy fuck we suck
pos,Pos,why am i seeing zion picture here
pos,Pos,how does a team shoot 2 26 from 3pt how does a team only make 2 3pt shots in an nba game in the 21st century when is the last time that happened 1984
pos,Pos,look at op username
pos,Neg,woooo lets go east coast dubs
pos,Pos,has every young core from the lakers gone off to better situations lonzo bulls kuz wiz randle knicks clarkson jazz d lo was rising with the nets and did decent with warriors
pos,Pos,why are so many of the game threads and post game thread pictures just different pictures of zion warming up lol
neg,Pos,boston trying to play 10 games while the rest of us at 6
pos,Pos,they should do everyone a favour and delete all evidence of this game existing
pos,Pos,celtics fans and bitching about the refs name a more iconic duo
pos,Pos,did someone say 2 dollar big macs
pos,Neg,easy game
pos,Pos,it s like the celtics are anti assist jalen iso the jason iso people used to shit on harden but he got assists to his open shooters i don t get this celtics no pass offence also why is zion in the thumbnail
neg,Neg,is westbrook this bad
pos,Pos,ahh the beauty of a team doing well when westbrook leaves dude stinks
pos,Pos,jayson tatum is not that guy trust me
pos,Pos,if celtics shot 15 from three they would win this game
pos,Pos,hell of a game not without some serious blunders by both teams that reversal was pretty questionable though
pos,Pos,so much iso ball from both teams
pos,Pos,i watched the game and obviously saw the celtics shoot like shit but i just realized that tatum was 10 32 wtf
neg,Pos,ooooo boy this should be crazy in here sorry celtics bros gg refs took over the game
pos,Pos,what a fun game back and forth double ot high intensity quality reffing just really fun gg celtics bros i ve really enjoyed the two games against you this season
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,tell me if i m being too homer but that tatum block on harrel in first ot was not a foul and the overturn on tatum s drive was a foul as well for the rest we actually played pretty decent i thought stayed in the game even though we had a terrible 3pt shooting night liked richardson s energy horfords defense was good brown played well just really hurts to lose like this for the 2nd time in 6 games
pos,Pos,the refs bring me immense pain
pos,Pos,that blatant foul overturned in crunch time in ot changed the momentum of the game and essentially sealed it right there must be nice to just have legitimate fouls disappear like that
pos,Neg,i love basketball
pos,Pos,3 points in 5 minutes exactly what you want from your offense right boston as a celtics bettor i m fuming rn lmfao
pos,Pos,wow i never expected kyle to flourish like this i hope he doesn t get too caught up on being a third star and he just sticks to playing his role
neg,Neg,that s one way to use brown in ot fun chaos march though
pos,Pos,no awards for a double ot game that puts the wizards tied for 1st in their division come ooonnnnnnn
pos,Pos,how can kcp play 41 min and get 2 1 4 can someone who watched game explain what the did
pos,Pos,are we sure that tatum is better than brown
pos,Pos,objectively a terribly officiated games refs actually gifted the wizards this game
pos,Pos,we can all agree that the refs had no power over these results fart noises
pos,Pos,celtics scored 3 points in the last 8 1 2 minutes of the two overtimes
pos,Pos,any celtics fan blaming the refs is an idiot but anyone saying the refs didn t play a part here in some capacity is equally moronic that being said and i know this will sounds like sour grapes but i cannot fathom why there isn t a time limit on reviews in any sport if after a minute or something you see nothing conclusive enough to overturn then the original call should stand in basketball soccer football hockey baseball tennis every sport
pos,Pos,anyone got the streamable of the foul on tatum that was overturned in 2nd ot
pos,Pos,i saw a lot of blazer fans wishing we got udoka instead of billups looking like we got the better one so far
neg,Pos,that user name
pos,Pos,spooky
pos,Pos,like half of our games so far have been at least ot
pos,Pos,sometimes you just shoot 8 from 3
neg,Pos,who s the guy on the thumbnail
pos,Pos,the celtics need a new coach holy shit this is bad and jayson tatum needs to get traded to another team
pos,Pos,the wizards rly got beal kcp dinwiddie kuz trez and bertans
neg,Neg,2 threes made
neg,Neg,celtics losing close games wow just like last season
pos,Pos,let s go wizzards
pos,Pos,as a cs fan tatum s bad habits he picked up from kobe are becoming worse 30 shots less than 30 points i m not concerned about the team but it does feel like every year we take a step back despite the talent we have kobe and mike both averaged near 30 shots they both averaged 35 tatum isn t those guys despite how much he thinks he is we re good enough to stay in games but we can never finish them
pos,Pos,holy fck the celtics shot 2 26 from 3
pos,Pos,are the celtics the best 2 4 team right now
pos,Pos,ah the kuzma effect
pos,Pos,the wizards this year are showing the full russ experience this year as soon as russ left the team significantly improved they now lost way less dumb ball spencer dinwiddie are a far better complementary piece for beal and overall the stole 3 useful player for a washed up bad fit westbrook i expect them been easily in the playoffs this season and they will also compete for the second round unlike last season
pos,Pos,i feel like kyle kuzma s trade to the wizards really benefited the wizards more than the lakers in my opinion
pos,Pos,the east is so much fun to watch rn and that includes the drama in brooklyn and philly
pos,Pos,brown really is better then hero ball tatum isn t he
pos,Neg,lakers lose to wizards in the finals
neg,Neg,love you wizards what a game it was
pos,Neg,think the wizards really made a smart move ditching westbrook
pos,Neg,shout out to the refs for bs calls all game
pos,Pos,kelly the lunch lady olynyk is a fucking stud
neg,Pos,gary harris with the 23
pos,Pos,well everybody s got a win now
pos,Pos,our bench is unbelievably bad cole anthony 15 in 35 minutes and the rest of the team 22 in 13 minutes cole has a positive net rating despite our team as a whole being mind bogglingly shitty 12 4 we desperately need fultz back to stabilize our bench rj hampton ain t a point guard and suggs isn t ready to lead good units
neg,Pos,cade finally leading us to a win
pos,Pos,kelly o thats all
pos,Pos,orlando couldn t just score one more point to cover the spread for us degens
neg,Pos,first win of the season for the pistons i m happy for them
neg,Pos,cole anthony again with a double double in rebounds listed 6 2 probably shorter
pos,Pos,i like that we won but i am still sad and i want to kill myself
pos,Pos,look at me look at me we are the trash bros now cade and killian
pos,Pos,jamaal mosley had been one of the worst coaches so far this year i get our bench is bad but that just means just have to play the starters 34 plus minutes each game and learn to properly stagger them suggs was awesome on defense his effort is ridiculous and whenever he is out the game we luck lost also mo bamba is just a bad defensive player he needs to be on the bench because we struggle to score on the second unit and that s his best asset wcj needs to play more idk if he is hurt but it s frustrating watching winnable games fall away if cliff was coach he wouldn t have let these games slip away because bad defensive players wouldn t get any minutes
pos,Pos,it is embarrassing watching the magic play they have so much young talent and they are wasting them if they don t want to actually try to win games they should just disband from the league or they should just decide to tank the rest of the season to make sure they get a top three pick they should also stop selling season tickets for the next 10 years until they are actually ready to win
pos,Neg,willie green is gonna be a really good nba coach their zone from half 1 was immaculate and their late game game plan was great they wasted no time at all until graham s last possession
pos,Pos,star j randle with only 9 shot attempts is good to see too
pos,Neg,knicks throwing away their lead so that rj barrett has to become a star and carry the team on his back to victory high iq move by thibs
pos,Pos,the pelicans new coach got them playing hard without their 2 best players pretty good sign fun game to watch
pos,Neg,herb jones
pos,Pos,rj barrett every game i wish for an rj 40 point game realistic or not this only fuels that dream
pos,Pos,dear sir or madam
pos,Pos,bada bing bada bong
pos,Pos,man this one hurts we haven t even really been playing like ass except for two games which were winnable but sloppy a lot of these games against tough opponents has been played close enough to win in the last minutes but 1 6 makes us look like the worst roster on the planet
pos,Pos,don t you regret not coming to the kniiiiicks
pos,Pos,57 from three typical knicks things now what a world what a life
neg,Pos,you cannot convince me this team isn t selling on purpose to make this demon show up rj is going to be a star and everybody else is just going to have to deal with it
neg,Pos,rj did everyone on the court on both ends amazingly today efficient shooting too love to see him prosper all star
neg,Pos,we re a star player away from being decent just glad we didn t get blown out
neg,Pos,rj is an all star kemba and fournier are great complementary pieces jv is a beast we can t close out a game gg pels hope zion comes back soon
neg,Neg,my heart can t fucking take this for 82 games rj barrett is a star hey kd
pos,Pos,broadway barrett
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,first r nba said rj barrett will never be a good shooter he came out shooting 40 from 3 on good volume his second season they said he would never really have a developed handle his handle is already looking better and he is defending at a really high level you guys always move the goalposts now r nba says he will never be an all star and he will never develop to that level let s see if they re correct
neg,Pos,pelicans i really really enjoyed your announcers tonight they re fantastic
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,go new york go new york go go new york go new york go new york go
pos,Pos,the one day i work nights rj decides to score thirty fucking five
pos,Pos,nice win for the knicks i am happy to see rj play so well
pos,Pos,i m telling y all rj has a psycho mode where he s locked the fuck in on every facet of the game and will not let us lose i saw it when we beat memphis in ot last yr i saw it tonight this man is the goods
pos,Pos,rj barrett i love you
pos,Pos,not a pretty win but love that they finally started going to rj down the stretch
pos,Neg,biiiiing booooong doors are closing mind the gap between the knicks and the second place team in the atlantic division all aboard the hyyype trizain
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,so who are we getting with the pick
pos,Pos,bing bong barrett baby
pos,Pos,rowan alexander barrett bing bong
pos,Neg,pelicans are bad but they re not hopeless this fan base needs to understand this and i know the calls about new orleans being a poverty organization get louder with every loss but i would rather this team be healthy than make the playoffs hell i m expecting us to drop 3 spots in the lottery at this point new orleans made the playoffs in ad s 3rd year but injury fallout was so great it ultimately ruined everything reps for the rest of the roster are important too
neg,Pos,gg knicks
pos,Neg,knicks are here baby the knicks are fucking here baby
pos,Neg,starj barrett would like your gentle apologies
neg,Neg,this knicks team is so awesome to root for
pos,Pos,knciks

pos,Pos,bada bing i can t lie
pos,Neg,unintelligible jowl noises bing bong
pos,Pos,rj looks nice but this was a pretty low energy game there were like 5 people in the arena kemba and hart were smiling and joking around with each other
pos,Neg,bulls and knicks are good wtf year is it
neg,Pos,i live in jersey city so it s great to see the knicks be this good they ll be contenders for the east this year
pos,Pos,yeah the knicks rule
neg,Pos,where all my ride or dies at
pos,Pos,why isnt zion playing
neg,Pos,zion ain t wanna come back to this team
pos,Pos,i m not going to overreact until the knicks beat a real nba team
neg,Neg,new orleans are just so disappointing
neg,Pos,the raptors will never win an easy game again
pos,Pos,we are over 500
neg,Pos,great game from svi
pos,Pos,how tf is scottie barnes the leading scorer for raptors again wow he s exceeded all expectations
neg,Pos,scottie barnes is indeed a good basketball player
neg,Neg,scottie was 1 for 4 from the free throw line then comes in and hits 2 clutch free throws that man is a star in the making
neg,Neg,i do not miss the tampa bay raptors in any way
neg,Neg,pacers just need to rebuild now
pos,Pos,us raptors fans toxicity is gonna reach 2019 levels soon if scottie keeps this up
pos,Pos,i am in love with scottie barnes
neg,Pos,scotty holding his hand and having somebody else take the headset off for him in the post game interview has me worried
pos,Pos,can we stop letting the other team come back in the last 2 minutes of the game
pos,Pos,mad respect to matt devlin for continuing to commentate on a sore throat he was working off three packs of fisherman s friend and a honey tea
neg,Pos,worried about scottie s hand he was holding it for a long time in the interview he didn t use it to take off the headset
pos,Pos,we won this for matty
pos,Pos,shooting is slowly improving but still rough a team full of young athletic players bullying everyone has been stressful but entertaining
pos,Pos,don t look now but the toronto raptors are above 500
pos,Pos,the church of scottie barnes growing by the minute
neg,Pos,pacers must be the most fucked team by injuries so far no way that team should be 1 6
pos,Neg,rip matty s voice
pos,Pos,fvv with 39 minutes on a b2b he s gonna be burnt out by december if these minutes continue
pos,Pos,revenge of the bjorkgren
neg,Pos,as a raps fan i despise t j mcconnell
pos,Neg,hopefully just a stinger on his hand but scottie favouring after the game please be okay
pos,Neg,scottie
neg,Neg,pacers are actually going to get a top 10 pick fans should be happy
pos,Pos,i just can t believe scottie is in his 6th game and he s maybe our most reliable player
neg,Neg,grimy stuff even if we won i feel like we all lost alvin williams and dikembe mutombo calling the game tonight shoutout to scottie fred gary for being so routinely clutch
pos,Neg,all my friends love scottie clutch
neg,Pos,barnes just had his 3rd 20 point game in 7 total games and he lead the raptors in scoring for 4 of those what a fucking blessing he is for us
pos,Pos,imagine being the team that lost to this pacers team lol couldn t me
neg,Pos,i feel like every pacers loss have been by like 5 or less
neg,Neg,sgoattie barnes
neg,Neg,someone please post sabonis missed 3 to tie the game that was def a rebound by og cost me winning 400 that was 100 an og rebound no
pos,Neg,in another timeline suggs would ve been in toronto while orlando has barnes sigh
pos,Pos,the scottie show continues imagine if they actually start running plays for him
pos,Pos,i remember when a raptors fan was comparing scottie to giannis summer league and i clowned him but now idk man
neg,Neg,who wins more games the thunder or the pacers
pos,Pos,scottie seemed to injure his finger on the second last play but no one is talking about it and did the post game interview in pain lol
pos,Neg,i get that being a 6 8 seed constantly is good for revenue because of playoffs but at this point if you the pacers you blow it up and rebuild being stuck in limbo must be hell
pos,Pos,wtf is up with the pacers they have a good squad but they re losing a lot of close games
pos,Pos,the raptors needa stop with these last minute chokes lmao boutta give me a heart attack
pos,Pos,sad paver noises
pos,Pos,glad i didn t get league pass
pos,Pos,the raptors rebuild took a couple of weeks
pos,Pos,chris duarte is really good too i had no idea who he was before this
pos,Pos,feeling bad for carlisle indiana management is very stubborn as they have been trying to compete for all years after paul george trade lavert tj warren etc would only make this team a 7th seed they lack no 1 and no 2 guy to build around sabonis would be 3rd and myles turner can be 4th guy in a winning team
pos,Pos,god the pacers blow lmao please give us myles turner
neg,Pos,sviiiiiiiiii
pos,Pos,championship coach that guy rick
neg,Neg,rick rolled himself huh
pos,Pos,dragic for sabonis
pos,Pos,scotty doesn t know
pos,Pos,you know the vibes
pos,Pos,this is getting bleak for the pacers watch out for a trade if things continue to go south
pos,Pos,the pacers are freaking 1 6 and the only game they won they beat the heat and cost me a 6 game parlay
pos,Pos,scottie barnes roty
pos,Pos,the raptors are a young team with a lot of new players they are learning to play with each other and they are starting to come together with some chemistry the bench unit is also starting to come together as well whan siakam and yuta come back they will be much better and deeper as well barnes siakam and og should be something on both sides of the ball
pos,Pos,pacers keep losing these close games they d have a winning record if they finished strong in these games
pos,Pos,that was a grind and a half
pos,Pos,r nba is just r raptorsupvotesonly no way should this game be one of the most upvoted of the night
pos,Pos,another typical sabonis game puts up great stats yet has the worst on the team
pos,Pos,seems like almost every game maxey starts out slow and comes alive in the second half
pos,Neg,revenge game for philly
pos,Pos,tyrese maxey
pos,Pos,every player except cam deserve all the ridicule that s going to come for them truly awful start to the season it looks like they aren t even trying half the time
neg,Neg,so it was solomon hill s fault all along
pos,Pos,i don t even know at this point lmao we just look like straight trash on both ends of the floor
pos,Pos,i could watch thybulle play defense all day dude is special
pos,Pos,tremendous defensive effort from thybulle kept the hawks from making a run in the second half can someone smarter than me make a composition of all his steals blocks deflections niang has also been such a nice addition to this team brings a nice bit of defense passing and shooting of course that one pull up three off a drummond screen was wild reddish looked real nice tho dude hit tough baskets over and over again nice to see him putting it together his defense is already formidable early game deandre hunter post ups on curry didn t seem to work out nice to see the help defense come out quick and strong early on
pos,Pos,simmons was sorely missed today by one of these teams
pos,Neg,matisse thybulle for dpoy he was fucking everywhere tonight
pos,Pos,thybulle needs more minutes his defense rotations everything is amazing
pos,Pos,why arent the hawks trying
pos,Pos,process me the fuck up thats some good process right th ere right there if i do saү so my self i say so thats what im talking about trust the process me right now chorus process mmmmmꮇм нo0оଠｏooｏoоଠଠooooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ sam hinkie is my daddy
pos,Pos,satisfying w
pos,Pos,this was a therapeutic experience for us thank you atlanta for coming in not particularly interested in the game
pos,Pos,i wanna give tyrese maxey a big shout out for his game tonight he did well offensively like usual but other than trae getting him a couple of times he did a great job covering him for the most part
neg,Pos,just a little taste of vengeance as a treat for the sixers
neg,Pos,bracing myself for the 5th quarter collapse
pos,Pos,trae with the 23
pos,Pos,revenge
pos,Pos,thybulle
pos,Pos,we suck again
pos,Pos,hawks mvp ben simmons with the dnp tonight
pos,Pos,i mean besides trae and cam reddish it has looked like no one on our team gives a flying fuck about any facet of the game
pos,Pos,that game got outta hand for the hawks pretty quick but they killed the offensive boards for most of that game
pos,Pos,this means nothing but just lmao that this is so far down the hot filter if it was reversed it would be the top post with multiple awards and you know it
pos,Pos,trae can t flop his way into bullshit points now and look
neg,Pos,new rule is already done i guess lmao trae goes to the line on back to back possesions after jumping into the defender other than that i guess fun game
pos,Pos,how the hell did joel embiid only get 5 rebounds
pos,Pos,foul baiting bitch trae looks like shit without his fouls collins sucks ass too
pos,Pos,trae looks nothing like the player he was the past 3 years rule changes or not there is something off about him
pos,Pos,weird game
pos,Pos,who needs a 33 ft shooter and a traffic cone in the halfcourt when you can win 5v5 offense with no one clogging the paint and getting hacked also did a great job containing trae to 5 16 shooting without the bitch hawks missing ben more than the sixers
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,shoulda did this last post season
pos,Pos,the defense is real you will not convince me otherwise
neg,Pos,can we just appreciate for a second how much zach lavine has stepped up his game on defense the man can completely hold his own out there this season he still isn t warm shooting tbh but his game is still growing in front of our eyes
pos,Pos,don t sweat it jazz you were only playing the best team in the nba
pos,Pos,no way were we gettin jingled right after gettin bing bonged
pos,Pos,lavine and derozan are such a deadly duo i hope this ends all talks about the bulls not beating winning teams
pos,Pos,shoutout to tony bradley with the team high 19
pos,Pos,bulls are legit if they have this kind of chemistry so early
pos,Pos,good win for the bulls they are legit jazz need to work on their turnovers fknlolkillme
pos,Pos,i m glad vooch was able to close the game at the end after a poor shooting night
pos,Neg,bulls perimeter defense is no joke benny the bull shooting backwards half court 3 pointers during a timeout shot about as well as we did
pos,Pos,play a real team
pos,Pos,demar is exactly the guy we needed man
pos,Pos,us a play in team one more time mother fuckers
pos,Pos,this thing might be for real when s the last time anybody thought that about the bulls i don t mean that rhetorically like literally what was the last time
pos,Pos,bulls are legit 5 1 even with cold shooting and vooch starting slow almost every game
pos,Pos,the worst defense in the league strikes again
pos,Pos,good omen for bull fans the last time you ruined something like this for the jazz things went well for you also seems like the loss against the knicks was helpful it seems like it actually built team chemistry and cohesion also jazz do look legitimately spooky they almost pulled off the comeback their shooting actually gets better in the clutch
neg,Pos,they told me that the demar signing was the worst of the off season they liiiieeeeedddd
pos,Neg,the bulls are fucking legit
pos,Pos,magic defeat the knicks to give them their first loss of the season knicks defeat the bulls to give them their first loss of the season bulls defeat the jazz to give them their first loss of the season the end of undefeated teams in the current 2021 22 nba season
pos,Pos,no more lossless team babeh demar and lavine combo is sooo good
pos,Neg,if we can t be undefeated no one can
pos,Pos,i never understood all the demar hate he s not kawhi obv but he s still an all star level player
pos,Pos,demar is overpaid vucevic trade was awful for chicago chicago will not be good defensively
pos,Pos,lonzo ball and caruso are a fucking nightmare on defense mitchell couldn t breathe in a 2nd half
pos,Pos,this is your reminder that john hollinger had demar derozan as the 12th most valuable free agent this year valued less then 500k more per year then andre drummond and bruce brown 4 mill a year less then danny green and 8 million less a year then duncan robinson thank you for your time good night
pos,Pos,but i thought the bulls couldn t beat good teams
pos,Pos,i know it s only been 6 games but can we retire those the bulls are a bad defensive team takes
pos,Pos,my man ayo is proving all the teams that passed on him won wrong his defense is great for a rookie
pos,Pos,im not even religious but dear heavenly father budda mj please bless these bulls knees achilies ankles hands wrists and may they suffer not a single injury through this entire season because they came to fucking play and they are the real deal amen edit typo
pos,Pos,32 points on zero made threes is some vintage deebo shit i love it
pos,Pos,bulls are so fun to watch
pos,Pos,the difference is the jazz don t have swingin seniors and we do gotta impress the ladies
pos,Neg,derozan s midrange is like sex
pos,Pos,derozan the goat
neg,Pos,i love demar proving he was worth the deal he signed
pos,Pos,im just like derozan everytime i shoot it goez in
neg,Pos,4 0 who you gonna call shout out to ddj and tony bradley played good d tonight
pos,Pos,holy shit i think we re good
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,finally chicago is back
pos,Pos,bulls are insane at home
pos,Pos,81 1 bulls incoming
neg,Neg,90s bulls are back attempting 21 3s
pos,Pos,these guys are actually legit
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,the bulls will face the nets in the playoffs and will win i m calling this now
pos,Pos,yeah but can the bulls beat a contender
neg,Pos,turns out the bulls can beat good teams surprisingly enough
pos,Pos,the cross town rivals ucla usc strikes again actually pretty cool to have a vucevic derozan usc and ball lavine ucla socal bulls
pos,Pos,bulls defensive juggernaut like we all predicted
pos,Pos,thread movin so fast no one gonna know my wife s best friend is pegging me rn
pos,Pos,we are legit
pos,Pos,important win for the bulls
pos,Pos,dudes really think they can just show up against the bulls lol
pos,Pos,spider could not get past deballzach
pos,Pos,bulls looking legit
pos,Pos,bulls are proving me wrong didn t think the pieces fit seems the defense will hold good for chicago
pos,Pos,it turns out when you play worse than the other team you usually lose
pos,Pos,this team is for real folks
pos,Pos,for the first time since 2017 we beat the jazz believe the hype
pos,Pos,s o to the swingin seniors they re the real mvps
pos,Pos,let s gooo the bulls are so fun also all those smug jazz fans in the postgame when the bulls lost one lolll
pos,Pos,i want that fuckin knicks game back
pos,Pos,idk how much other people noticed but the jazz were trying so hard to avoid the donovan vs lonzo matchup every single time lonzo was man to man with mitchell 100 the set a screen on the other hand donovan was cooking up caruso whenever ac was the on hall defender lonzos so good bruh
pos,Pos,man bradley was solid off the bench
pos,Pos,demar
neg,Neg,bulls unironically the best in the east
pos,Pos,lets goooo
pos,Pos,chicago bulls 2022 nba champions
pos,Pos,man we need mitchell to figure his shooting out he s struggling so far this season
pos,Pos,damn bulls are the real deal huh
pos,Pos,demar is that dude if you didn t think that before you really haven t been paying attention
pos,Pos,all my homies root for the bulls drive home safe beep beep
neg,Pos,if only a young drose had this much talent around him
pos,Pos,we are winning it all aren t we
neg,Neg,throwback to 1998
pos,Pos,lakers gave up derozen heild and caruso for westbrook i can t
pos,Pos,well i m super glad i bought lakers vs bulls tickets when they first went on sale they were cheap and now the bulls are looking good af plus the return of the goat to staples jersey trade with lebron is gonna be hype
neg,Neg,fate demands a bulls heat ecf derozan vs lowry is too great of a showdown for the basketball gods to pass up
neg,Neg,i m loving the parity in the league at the moment from last season seeing the suns and hawks reach new heights to seeing power shifts with the bulls and knicks now obviously very early on but i love it
pos,Pos,you just lost to deballzach
pos,Pos,this is only their 6 game together just wait until the chemistry is all there and they get healthy they will bing bong the knicks out of the playoffs in 4
pos,Pos,thank you bulls
pos,Pos,i ll be honest i was very skeptical about the fit at first when we got demar was concerned him zach couldn t coexist such could not be happier to be eating crow
pos,Pos,mike conley is really important to this team
pos,Pos,i think playing mike tonight would ve helped let s hope keeping him fresh for the bucks ends up paying off
pos,Pos,bricked
pos,Pos,statement win
pos,Pos,dang go bulls
pos,Pos,i miss derozan on my spurs
pos,Neg,bulls are for real
neg,Pos,the caruso effect
pos,Pos,are the are the bulls legit
pos,Neg,this team is fun to watch
pos,Pos,has derozan been the first option mostly since coming over
pos,Pos,sup
pos,Pos,are the bulls real i believe so lavine is a star player and they legit have a shot at going to the finals
pos,Pos,chicago is so fun to watch this year thanks for giving me a simple respite from mav s games where we re doomed to keep kidd at least for three years because cuban is a fucking moron
pos,Pos,bulls are so fun to watch holy shit
pos,Neg,so our raptors boy derozan out there making bulls look good lol
neg,Pos,deballzach show is popping
neg,Neg,mj is now the second best to ever don on a bulls jersey
pos,Pos,these bulls are for real
pos,Pos,shit if gobert keeps this up it will be one of the best rebounding seasons of all time wilt included
neg,Neg,bulls are ecf bound
pos,Pos,bulls are contenders full stop put em in the same convo as brooklyn and milwaukee
pos,Neg,djj and green impacted the game a lot more than pat does with their minutes
pos,Pos,bulls vs jazz 2022 finals callin it now
neg,Neg,bro does the nba have an off season
pos,Pos,eh between no conley and some awful refereeing it s not that bad a loss still crazy if people don t think rudy s the best player on the team though mitchell s best game of the season and he goes 9 27
neg,Neg,grizz y all scored 103 on the heat in regulation hang a banner
neg,Neg,having kyle is the best thing that s happened to jimmy being able to focus on scoring and defense and not being our de facto point guard is terrific for him
pos,Pos,jimmy s haircut was holding him back this whole time
neg,Pos,where is max is he safe is he alright
pos,Pos,the heat are good at basketball
pos,Pos,we might be looking at the best team in the east i mean holy fuck this defense
pos,Pos,the east is better than the west
pos,Pos,what a sad win can only hope strus is ok
pos,Pos,jimmy mvp campaign continues
neg,Neg,couldn t ever have picked a better team to cheer for in my life i love these guys to death and now kyle has caught his stride and duncan is hitting his shots its fair to say that heat are making the finals again and theyre winning
neg,Pos,congrats to the grizzlies for completing the 100 point challenge on no bam difficulty
pos,Pos,you always knew that miami s 3 game would eventually thaw glad it came through tonight hope the injury isn t serious
neg,Pos,i hope max strus is ok please be just a sprain
neg,Pos,i have been waiting for this ahem kyle lowry ain t no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
neg,Neg,i just texted my buddy that memphis just got their ass beat by the best team in the league i believe that the heat scare the shit out of me

pos,Pos,tyler herro is legit a 6moty front runner right now
pos,Pos,congratulations to the memphis grizzlies for being the first team to score 100 points against the miami heat in regulation
neg,Neg,please not an acl for strus
pos,Pos,high temps bad for bears save our forests
pos,Pos,shooting finally showed up and the defense was still impressive even missing bam and dedmon getting in foul trouble huge win against a great team on the second night of a back to back on the road also got a ud basket to end off the night not much else you can ask for
neg,Pos,jimmy butler sure is much more aerodynamic with his new hair cut
pos,Pos,that was a massacre but heat deserved the w tonight
neg,Neg,this heat team got so many options for buckets and jimmy butler is having his best start to his career yet no one having him as a mvp candidate
neg,Pos,butler 27 points on 12 shots damn
pos,Neg,we scored 100 so we won right 10 30 21 miami heat greatest shooting of all time
pos,Pos,really hope strus is okay
neg,Neg,miami heat are gonna win the championship
pos,Neg,absolutely beautiful game from us season is a marathon and not a sprint though onto the next game on tuesday having a 4 0 week though is always nice this was a team win which is what i love to see everyone did their job also gg to the grizzlies first team to score 100 on us in regulation

neg,Pos,i was told that lowry was washed
pos,Pos,please don t be acl please don t be acl please don t be acl
pos,Pos,i hope jimmy win mvp
pos,Pos,good takeaway for the night still outrebounded a known good rebounding team by 18 boards without bam and with the centers in foul trouble all night fingers crossed for max
pos,Pos,udonis haslem
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,crazy shooting tonight we were 18 of 26 from three at one point lmao
pos,Pos,miami lookin real nice could be the finals favourite with kyrie out
pos,Pos,nice kyle
pos,Pos,i feel like coming into tonight most of us thought 2nd night of a back to back on the road no bam and playing a young grizzlies team this could very easily be a schedule l and then that happened 3 ball was unconscious after sucking the last 5 games i m gonna be a bit bold and say this is the best heat start to a season since the big 3 era it s not just the fact we re 5 1 we re demolishing our competition looking forward to tuesday dallas
pos,Pos,we need to have a conversation about jaren
pos,Pos,how y all liking lowry so far haven t been able to catch any heat games besides one because i been addicted to new pc i imagine he s not hated by most miami fans now
pos,Pos,heat looking scary
pos,Pos,bubble tax paid
neg,Pos,uh oh heat are in decline they allowed over 100pts today scrubs
neg,Neg,are fkn good go heat
pos,Pos,best team in the nba at the moment i m obviously not counting the unstoppabulls who are in tier 0 at the moment but the heat are the best of the 29 remaining teams
neg,Neg,culture
pos,Neg,max s injury looked more like an mcl or pcl than an acl can be just as bad but i believe the recovery timeframe is faster either way he won t be around for a while but caleb martin looks ready to play with our a squad
pos,Pos,ja morant jailed
pos,Pos,griz need to be a bit better to go through tight defenses like miami s also jjj cmon man you gotta unleash the power
pos,Pos,jjj is just plain awful

neg,Pos,well thank fuck that s over

pos,Pos,bucks legend bryn forbes showing out against his old team
pos,Pos,thad young was an absolute game changer late in the 3rd quarter
pos,Pos,best 14 seed of all time don t let the record fool you
neg,Neg,hot take but the bucks are better when they have jrue and brook compared to when they don t have jrue and brook
pos,Pos,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray
pos,Pos,our offense might be ass but our defense is pretty good lol
pos,Pos,bucks are now 6 10 without jrue this year and last maybe need him in the regular season not just the playoffs
pos,Pos,this game was hard to watch just very sloppy basketball from the bucks turnovers really made a huge difference and middleton staying cold doesn t help at all
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,oh lord it seems you ve lost to the san antonio spurs
neg,Pos,i m drunk as hell and here to simp for dejounte murray
neg,Neg,why do we finally win when we play bad
pos,Neg,good game by bryn and thad
pos,Pos,can we just have one of these 1 not shoot like dogshit on wide open shots 2 get jrue back 3 get brook back 4 not turn the ball over on stupidity 5 get that ref that gave 19fts to harden to ref giannis
pos,Pos,go spurs go
pos,Pos,what an ugly game lmao easily our worst one this season and we got a w dj is that dude i love him hopefully everyone gets back n track with shooting because it s bad gg
neg,Neg,the spurs dont have a closer
neg,Neg,i m sorry to anyone who watched this game lol it was not pretty
pos,Neg,bucks needs jrue back asap and murray for the spurs looking like a all star at the moment
pos,Pos,these turnovers killed the bucks
neg,Pos,san antonio trap game spurs
neg,Pos,yeah that makes sense

neg,Neg,not the larriors anymore
pos,Pos,3rd quarter steph put the game away after a lacklustre start and zero points in the 4th
pos,Pos,close game
neg,Neg,back to our regularly scheduled tanking folks
pos,Neg,last point wins
neg,Pos,only 5 turnovers for the starters vs 19 against the grizzlies
pos,Neg,okc actually scored more points in the 4th means they win right right
neg,Pos,steph so bad in 4th quarters kerr can t even put him in
pos,Pos,steph curry has not scored in the 4th quarter for 4 games in a row
neg,Pos,bummed out we didn t see a wiggins vs a wiggins
pos,Neg,that kuminga double pump fake with no defenders though welcome to the big boys league kumingod
pos,Pos,gp2 should have minutes reserved for him at the end of each quarter
pos,Pos,i missed this game how did my boy giddey go
neg,Neg,shout out to dray for being aggressive today
neg,Neg,fitz was saying he thinks poku has the skills even if he needs to fill out a little still thunder fans how high are you on poku
pos,Pos,kuminga had a better debut than cade in only 6 minutes
pos,Pos,how in the fuck did lakers lose this dumpster
pos,Pos,is it just me or was sga really passive in this game and compared to last game it felt like this game they tried to run the offense through giddey more
pos,Pos,alexa how do i avoid blowing a big lead against a bad team here s a video
neg,Neg,perfect deck
pos,Pos,gsw bulls finals confirmed
neg,Pos,nice tank job pressure on whoever loses to us next because how tf can you lose to this team
neg,Neg,not much to say about this game lol kind of just the expected result great work by draymond though
neg,Pos,stat of the game is steph with 27 minutes need a lot more of that
neg,Neg,when do the warriors play the bulls
pos,Pos,garbage time was really that tonight welcome to the league rook
pos,Pos,when the 1 in the 1 5 is against your team
pos,Pos,kuminga s vision is seriously impressive for a rookie made lots of nice passes out there even if it didnt result in buckets hes also freakishly strong
pos,Pos,contender
pos,Pos,kuminga with a 3 for his first points the passing small sample size but he s looking good
pos,Pos,giddey is gonnabe so great larry bird 2 0
pos,Neg,warriors need to draw more fouls only 8 fts
pos,Pos,honestly loving giddey though
pos,Pos,dort
neg,Pos,imagine having only 1 win so far
pos,Pos,giddey for kuminga who says no
pos,Pos,this is such a disgusting team to watch
pos,Pos,curry washed even wiggins shooting more from 3
neg,Neg,imma just say it i don t give a shit kum bucket cade
pos,Pos,as usual steph doing what lebrick cant
pos,Pos,what would be dort s role if he were on a good team genuinely curious
neg,Neg,how are the worriors so much better than last year clay isnt back yet who did they get just younger guys developing well
neg,Pos,gotta get more draft picks collect em all
pos,Pos,what a wild ending
pos,Pos,unless i heard it incorrectly it seemed like the wolves announcers were implying kat does not personally like jok from something that happened on a int team in 2014 when they were briefly teammates i mean i just thought he hated jok in a competitive way what the hell happened
pos,Pos,will fucking barton my goodness what a block
pos,Pos,the nuggets own us and i hate it
neg,Pos,timely block by jokic
pos,Pos,sorry twolves y all knew the deal when you decided to win the play in game
pos,Pos,jokic was coming off of some knee soreness on the 2nd night of a back to back and dropped 26pts 19reb 7a and 3 blocks dudes been absolutely a monster on both sides of the ball lmao
pos,Pos,that ending was kinda oof edwards got confused with the buzzer sound even tho he was wide open
pos,Pos,minnesota wild losing to the av s in denver right now too
neg,Neg,i thought jokic had a right knee contusion and was gonna miss a game
pos,Pos,thought bones hyland gave us some real x factor tonight he deserves more minutes
pos,Pos,if you would have told me before the season that our half court offense would be our biggest issue i wouldn t have believed you
pos,Pos,got the win and only had to play barton 30 minutes getting 17 minutes and 3 assists out of bones is gonna be huge if it helps us get barton to the postseason healthy
pos,Pos,why is kat shooting less than edwards beasley and dlo
pos,Pos,that was a hell of a block by barton
pos,Pos,twolves got a squad sheesh once ant gets that jump shot going he s going to be a real problem also i miss beasley right about now
pos,Pos,this game is so easy for jokic now underrated on defense he shut down kat on 2 3 straight possessions in 4th always plays smart team defense not a liability like national media makes it
pos,Pos,wolves definitly much improved under finch gg
neg,Pos,really good defense by timberwolves all game tbh can t be mad at the results when we were getting really good looks all game just not converting i think in kat s head he s still better than jokic he s not and he probably should realize that today jokic is just a way smarter player
neg,Neg,edwards almost pulled a matt barnes and shoot from half court
neg,Neg,jokic was masterful and dragged this team to a win it s crazy that people say he isn t a top 5 player
pos,Pos,jokic is still the best player on the court
pos,Pos,timberwolves forgot how to play offense at the end lol
pos,Pos,what a wild ending to this game clutch block by barton jokic contest too guess ant wasn t ready for it dang he was bleeding again wolves look much improved glad we got the pick last draft lol
pos,Pos,giannis jokic and steph is gonna be the most wholesome mvp race ever
pos,Pos,yikes mpj lol
pos,Pos,i m gonna kill myself
neg,Neg,crazy finish also did anybody see how much blood jokic had on his arm and jersey at the end feels like something is off with kat he s slow but still presses way too hard going against jokic too
pos,Neg,twolves announcers bragging how wolves where shutting jokic down he ends up with 26 pts 19 rebounds and 7 assists not towns ended up with 14 pts 8 rebounds nobody shuts down the joker
pos,Pos,jokic is making a case to be the best player in the leauge he honestly might reach there
pos,Pos,well i liked nothing about that but the defense was good and malik played great
pos,Pos,honestly you can t even blame edwards the buzzer shouldn t have sounded off but he s definitely kicking himself rn
pos,Pos,kat played bad zzzzz we missed a million layups zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz oh well on to next
neg,Neg,our defense still has over 10 blocks and steals tonight but scoring was seriously missing
pos,Pos,insane ending lol
pos,Neg,it s crazy these teams were rivals minny with the upper hand in 2018 and since then denver has just absolutely lapped them they ll be a playoff team this year but man the gap between jokic and kat got big and so did the gap between the teams 12 straight wins for denver
pos,Neg,that hurt my soul
neg,Neg,it hurts to be a fan of this team
pos,Pos,jokic with a game winning block at end perfect
neg,Pos,jokic just showing kat who the big dogs are he s nowhere close to him and embiid s level
pos,Pos,holy shit what a finish
pos,Pos,ant my dude why were you ass tonight
neg,Pos,2 missed lay ups to end the game
pos,Pos,2nd night of a b2b on the road play like shit still get the w would ve been a blowout if our bench was played even an average game tonight too
pos,Pos,we own wolves 12 straight wins
neg,Neg,fucking ew
pos,Pos,really great game buzzer fucked with ant or he drives hard and wins it or gets fouled good ugly win by the nuggets wolves couldn t hit an open 3 to save their lives
pos,Pos,how were the wolves supposed to win with a one armed kat wolves fans told me jokic dismembered him olynyk style
neg,Neg,will barton
pos,Pos,and this is the start of wolves fall 11th place here they come
pos,Pos,brutal loss for the wolves i m sorry for the several fans here who were witness to that
neg,Pos,wow
pos,Neg,soft attempt for edwards at the end
pos,Neg,shit what a finish after trailing the entire game
pos,Pos,starters were abysmal down the stretch
pos,Pos,wolves made no effort to get to the basket towards the end just kept chucking it live and die by the 3
pos,Pos,geez what a twolves way to end the game
pos,Pos,our offense has been dodo so far
neg,Neg,nuggets fans non fan here am i overreacting to box score stats or does mpj suck this year so far how re you feeling about his current level of play and future development
pos,Pos,the cavs are going to live or die on mobley this year cavs have a legit future all star im going to follow the cavs closely
neg,Neg,that game was weird as hell the energy of the team is completely off may be just a finals hangover still but we seem to just be going through the motions i hope da has nothing serious going on
pos,Neg,ayton with 17 12 with a plus 30 in 24 minutes is good
pos,Pos,i thought it was hilarious watching cp3 miss 4 free throws in a row he is usually so automatic i kept saying to myself he cant miss another one but he kept missing lol luckily it didn t cost us the game gg cavs fans your future is looking brighter
neg,Neg,i can understand a coach riding out the guys who cut the lead down but still thought it was weird that sexton wasn t brought back in garland markennen and mobley all struggled though so maybe that s why
pos,Pos,gg cavs miss rubio that cold stretch in the second was brutal cedi was on fire hot damn
pos,Pos,2 80 here we come
neg,Pos,cedi steph curry osman
pos,Pos,cp3 good game win
pos,Pos,ggs suns however why is mr jb playing denzel with 5 mins left down 14 seemed competitive still while denzel and competitive are quite antonymous he attempted a 30 foot 3 lolz bricked a jumper and had 3 fouls not sure if our starters were getting rest or whatever but i d like more minutes from windler regardless suns big 3 was great tonight
pos,Pos,fuck jb i want this aashat launched into the sun
pos,Pos,why is ayton only getting 24 minutes
pos,Neg,cavs fans you guys sad upset about letting kpj go or does the bright future overlook that situation
pos,Neg,our offense looks so bad one of the worst in the league so far we are fucked without ayton our bench is way worse than last season really miss payne and saric
pos,Pos,richaun holmes shooting 100 from 3 and only king to shoot over 25 from 3 today
pos,Pos,me living by the three haha fuck yeah yes me dying by the three well this fucking sucks what the fuck
pos,Pos,ntilikina again so good for us i hope he gets more minutes
neg,Neg,i m surprised the mavs are 4 2 the way mavs fans have been acting on this sub i thought they must have been 1 4 or something
pos,Pos,both teams shot like garbage from 3
pos,Pos,french prince i believe
pos,Pos,where were you when frank led the mavs bench in scoring
pos,Pos,frank better continue getting regular minutes
pos,Neg,shooting 7 36 from 3 is the reason we lost this game can we please get an average game from fox
pos,Pos,man the dude they picked over luka has really been benched
pos,Neg,i now know what the purpose of this franchise is to make former knicks castoffs into quality basketball players kevin knox 45 from 3 on this team next season is coming
pos,Pos,damn mah boi ntilkina doing well off the bench for dallas o
pos,Pos,here s your dallas mavs post game summary now in our 6th season 6 did the mavs win our sub would ve imploded even further had we choked that oddly enough our starting 5 each had a 3 in the first 4 minutes of the game 3 luka started much better this game compared to last game with some bounces going the right way unlike friday night finished with 23 8 10 going relatively quiet in the 2nd half outside of that heaves 3 timmy also played better than last game with 16pts off of 4 3 s kp missed his 3rd game now with lower back tightness hopefully he s gonna be back soon with maxi now injured dwight with a solid 12 8 despite what our sub thinks maxi with 7 5 going a perfect 3 3 from the field before having to exit due to injury only playing 7min get well soon doe doe with 13 6 with 2 steals and one emphatic dunk in transition bench analysis frank was huge for us today both leading the bench in scoring and playing some pivotal defense to keep us in this 12 3 2 while also going 2 2 from 3 brunson bullock both had rough shooting nights with near identical stat lines combining for 15 5 5 glad we got the win improving our record on halloween to 9 3 next game is tuesday against the heat on espn
neg,Neg,i believe in frank
pos,Pos,that french d will bring us to the promise land
neg,Neg,lmfao holmes just fucked my spread so fucking hard
neg,Neg,i speak for all mavs fans thank you knicks for the french prince
pos,Pos,what a brickfest
neg,Neg,just one of those days we aren t going to win the game shooting something like 4 from 3 halfway through the fourth quarter i felt like we were doing ok in the 1st half by attacking the paint but alas the inevitable outcoaching adjustment by the opponent happens at half and the interior scoring went away buddy tries to bring us back but he always does his best to counteract his good by chucking trash shots if this guy had even average bbiq and knew to not dribble not pass and only shoot when the opportunity presented itself he d be an absolutely devastating offensive weapon instead it s good buddy bad buddy all game to the point that he s basically neutral he even managed to squeeze in one of his patented late fourth quarter soft pass turnovers what s up with fox man it s just not there i mean you can t be this bad after getting paid small sample size be damned he has been horrendous haliburton looks bad too like he has no confidence davion is the real deal though man dude is bloodthirsty out there final dead horse beating observation everyone in the game thread point out all of luka s crying but i would rather have him crying on our side while draining 35 foot dagger threes than have that other guy who is never playing for reasons
pos,Pos,must be halloween cause that s the only explanation as to the mavs beating the kings
pos,Neg,jason kidd 4 2 rick carlisle 1 6
pos,Pos,don t see how people keep saying it was an ugly win mavs led nearly the entire game and played great d throughout
pos,Neg,luka vs the world
pos,Pos,on one hand happy we finally beat the kings on the other hand why can t we consistently play well
pos,Pos,we beat the kings our curse lifted 80 2 lfg
pos,Neg,we are 4 2 but this team doesnt give me any confidence lol feels like we can implode at any moment
pos,Pos,holmes with the buzzer beater as time expires in the 4th quarter
pos,Pos,well our defense can be good without kp
pos,Pos,marvin bagley is never going to play again lol
pos,Pos,fox putting on weight is the worst thing to ever happen not once has he played as good as he did last year his fat ass can t even attack the rim anymore he gassed out so damn quick is fat ass can t let him jump when shooting a jumper or going for lay and he went from an average defender to below average he fucked it all up if he played like how he did last year we easily going 6 0 it s like the kings are trying to carry him rn
pos,Pos,the mavs are 4 2 they way r nba talks about j kidd s coaching you would think they were 0 6
pos,Pos,luke got outcoached by kidd lol who knew smothering your 60 3pt shooters would cripple a team over reliant on them
pos,Pos,brick a thon
pos,Pos,is this your god
pos,Pos,the mavs should try to get terrance ross
pos,Pos,mavs actually beat the kings kidd confirmed better then rick
pos,Pos,my guy luka has been putting work in on defense
pos,Pos,logo luka
neg,Pos,ugly ass win
pos,Pos,luka is one of my favourite players but my goodness he complains a fuck ton
pos,Pos,really ugly unorganised basketball kidd and walton are cheeks really holding those teams down
neg,Pos,hey kings fans i ve been a kings watcher and fringe supporter for the last 3 years or so they re one of my most watched league pass teams due to when they play loving the broadcast team last couple seasons and ofc de aaron loved bogi and hield splashing barnes clutch factor etc anyway i haven t watched much at all of y all this season other than the 4th quarter when barnes won with the dagger what s going on why are fox s points down so much has tyrese taken a leap in any facet what s the fan bases long term hopeful plan with hield barnes bagley
pos,Pos,we keep winning so ugly seems like the whole team has forgotten how to shoot the ball like luka is bacially just scoring by layups can t make a jumpshot to save his life
pos,Pos,anyone else want to see simmons for fox i think that s a pretty fair trade and could benefit both teams
pos,Pos,lonzo vs fox at this point who do you take
neg,Neg,ball fox
pos,Pos,i was at this game and the kings bricks were so loud lol also richaun holmes is a beast
pos,Pos,why isn t moses brown getting more minutes wasn t he getting double doubles last year albeit on a terrible okc team trying to tank but still
pos,Pos,man these kings look scary this year i m excited to see them play
neg,Pos,honest question since i don t watch the kings often but why isn t bagley being played i know he s a meme for being picked over luka but he had great numbers his rookie year
pos,Pos,peopled sweared on me that fox played like what ja believe he was
pos,Pos,lukas this season so far at 11 3p abysmal too suprisingly good start for the mavs considering his performance through the first 6 games of the season
pos,Neg,doncic looks like hot garb
pos,Neg,being a kings fan aside watching luka play is unpleasant he just cries all game
pos,Pos,for a team that s going to have such a challenging season as the mavs this is what they absolutely need to do win as many winnable games as they can because they are going to lose a lot of the hard ones that s still not good enough to make the playoffs but getting in thru the play in because of luka and being a 1sr round exit for the third straight year should still be a success the team is just bad and they ve constantly overachieved because of luka and carlisle now they have a downgrade at coach and they roster hasn t gotten any better my take is kidd won t last longer than this season and luka stays maybe next year too and then will ask for a trade
pos,Pos,i don t get why other teams bother with big men just make 20 threes on elite efficiency every game it s too easy
pos,Pos,miles with 9 assists and spent half the game guarding dame not to overreact but he s basically lebron
pos,Pos,dame with another bad shooting night 2 14 from 3 his shooting is a big reason they re only 3 3
neg,Neg,buzz buzz mfers
pos,Neg,oubre and dame freaky friday d
neg,Neg,lamelo with the almost triple double what a legend already
pos,Pos,hornets got suns oubre this season
pos,Neg,big contrast from having just 1 weapon in kemba for idk 20 yrs this squad has weapons now my goodness
pos,Pos,lamelo winning mvp we sweeping the east winning the finals in 4 fight me bonk city baby
neg,Neg,cody martin locked up dame and blocked a step back good lord let s goooooooo
neg,Neg,how is our best player our worst player rn wtf
pos,Pos,start pj pls i cant take any more plumlee or portland can lend us cody back pls and thanks oh and the duality of oubre lol we got lucky dame had a poor shooting night too but happy to capitalise on it
pos,Pos,what s going on with lillard
pos,Pos,that guy talking shit to dame from the sideline is mvp
pos,Neg,the horneys are good
neg,Neg,lillard keeps this up and daryl morey really might be able to trade ben simmons for him
pos,Pos,hornets fun as hell to watch
neg,Pos,it really felt like charlotte scored everytime they came down the floor in the second half
pos,Pos,ggs you hit your shots we didnt lamelo is sick
neg,Neg,dollar dame now only worth 50 cents
pos,Pos,great bounce back from lamelo
pos,Pos,the oubre pickup has been fantastic if he can keep it up it gives us a legit 6th man and that makes me feel a lot better about this team s viability i don t think we can be a contender without a legit big but i think this is the year we can finally win a playoff series
pos,Pos,so question what is miles bridges is the charlottes best player can he be an all star what s his potential
pos,Pos,hornets didn t miss a single three
neg,Pos,how do you do
pos,Pos,scary terry back to haunt the trailblazers also bonk
pos,Pos,i said this in our sub but as a basketball fan i m worried about dame that game looked rough
neg,Pos,dame 2 14 lmao damn
neg,Neg,is dame playing like this to get traded because holy shit he s been ass this season
pos,Pos,dame sold
neg,Neg,i love this hornets team
pos,Neg,i had an erection all game watching the most handsome man in the league destroy my team
neg,Neg,i love this hornets team so fun to watch bridges is gonna be great
pos,Pos,lamelo
pos,Neg,everyone on this team makes me so proud
pos,Pos,guys i think the hornets are for real and mj may have taken the kwame brown jokes personally
pos,Neg,i just don t get how the whole summer is about how the team isn t good enough about how dame demands better and needs the team to step up and then he plays like this it s not even a shooting slump his passing was horrific the second half his shot selection terrible and on defense he looks like he doesn t give a shit meanwhile cj stepped up anfernee stepped up little is looking like a solid player nurk is looking improved new coach and lillard is just standing there with his arms out wide on defense while guards blow past him for easy layups fucking pathetic dame and it s literally costing us wins
neg,Pos,bridges is a fucking hoss
neg,Neg,dame hasn t been the same since making the 75th anniversary team
pos,Pos,i enjoy watching the hornets thanks for making league pass great again
pos,Pos,dang dame
pos,Pos,one of the more frustrating game i ve ever watched we were getting better looks than the hornets all night up until we got frustrated that nothing was falling in the final few minutes but just couldn t capitalize meanwhile oubre out here hitting 3s with a man is his grill shit was the epitome of make or miss league
pos,Pos,lillard in a real slump man
pos,Pos,should have never taken out simons for dame
pos,Pos,geez what is going on with dame
pos,Pos,dame selling my fantasy
pos,Pos,dame really playing his way to philly fr tho we are lucky tonight he hasn t hit his stride cause if he was hitting his usual shots it s a close game
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,enjoy this oubre game hornets fans
pos,Pos,damn that was a fun game to watch who tf is oubre jr and why did he rain from the sky
neg,Pos,i would bet money lillard has had more airballs in these 6 games than he usually has in a full season
pos,Neg,kelly oubre jr shooting better and going to the line more than dame as expected
neg,Neg,everyone talks mad shit about oubre but tonight was the night he had enough kill me
pos,Neg,i don t recognize this tsunami papi
pos,Pos,lame time
pos,Neg,portland has a serious problem
pos,Pos,damian yipps lillard
pos,Pos,this was rough really felt like we played better than them for 90 of the game but witnessed the first refball of the season has some stupid turnovers and the hornets couldn t miss 3s even though we were ding up
pos,Pos,dame is so checked out of portland dude must be looking at main line real estate everyday
neg,Neg,giannis attempting 11 threes in a game is not something i would ve ever expected to see
pos,Pos,at one point the bucks ran a line up of justin robinson jordan nwora rodney hood thanasis antetokounmpo sandro mamukelashvili
pos,Pos,why was it 27 fts to our 6 i didn t watch the game
pos,Pos,congratulations to the san antonio spurs
neg,Pos,great win by the spurs tonight according to the bucks announcer
neg,Neg,i see you coach bud playing random by benching giannis in the clutch
neg,Neg,look at us we re the spurs now
pos,Pos,spurs
pos,Neg,a win feels so much better than a loss
pos,Pos,honestly i had more takeaways about how talented this bucks team is playing hard with all those starters out they really crashed the offensive glass in the first half and played tough defensively giannis is awesome to watch every time grayson has really become a deadly shooter on the jazz side i thought both bigs played tough defense and royce did a good job making things difficult for giannis nice to see donovan really get aggressive clarkson didn t shoot it well but he played hard and made some great plays once the shooting comes around i think the jazz will look really good
pos,Pos,only the bulls can beat the jazz
neg,Neg,beginning to believe that conley is a good basketball player
pos,Pos,rip to jordan clarkson s 3pt streak
pos,Pos,finally a good game from donny
neg,Pos,i m so proud of thanasis
neg,Neg,jazz v knicks finals you heard it here first
pos,Pos,w road game on a back to back around 30 mins played for most starters good game for us can t fault the bucks with their injury report being as it is grayson allen had a great shooting night and kept the bucks in after they pulled giannis but he couldn t guard mitchell on the next possessions which sealed the game
pos,Pos,antetokounmpo led all 3 stats
neg,Neg,oh no i guess we re washed
pos,Pos,the jazz are probably going to win the whole thing this year
pos,Pos,honestly i expected us to lose this game by like 20 points but i liked our fight we just need to get healthy and we ll look like the milwaukee bucks and not the giannikee bucks
neg,Neg,we should be resting giannis on games where we are missing 35 of our salary cap and on a b2b we had a very deep run focus should be on recovery getting in as a 4 or 5 seed is fine this was a scheduled loss no need to play him
pos,Pos,i honestly thought this was gonna be the game for the jazz first loss
pos,Pos,dang the defending champs are 3 4
pos,Pos,some of the role players don t play with enough effort and some play really dumb also the officiating was so one sided i m 90 sure foster was covering the spread of 20 free throw discrepancy in no fairly officiated game should joe 0 9 fta career average ingles and giannis shoot the same amount of free throws
neg,Neg,milwaukee without holiday average
pos,Pos,someone tell me why giannis is taking 11 three pointers
neg,Pos,5 6 from the free throw line compared to 25 27
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,what s going on buckaroos i thought you were supposed to be good
pos,Pos,bucks chiefs pain
pos,Pos,jazz are like toronto from a demar era good regular season team lol
neg,Pos,regular season jazz is at it again
pos,Pos,jazz doing this just to get bounced in the 2nd round
pos,Pos,crazy efficiency from the nets
pos,Pos,already back to running tankathon
pos,Pos,cam thomas is yet to score his first nba bucket
pos,Pos,the fact that the nets bench was playing so well is a good sign for the team
pos,Neg,harden finished with his 59th triple double tonight tying larry bird for the 7th most all time
neg,Pos,kd just casually leaves the court with 10 13 fg oh and harden is finally getting into game shape like he said he would but people still wanted to criticize this man
pos,Pos,do any pistons fans hate the way dwayne casey deals with rotations in these less than competitive games i would rather see the actual important potential franchise cornerstone players get 30 minutes even in blowouts and have a shot at building more chemistry than muck about with minutes for guys like rodney mcgruder cory joseph trey lyles and frank jackson
pos,Pos,nets record for team fg that s crazy
neg,Neg,i swear the nets spread their fga around more than any team i ve seen recently really surprising to me because i expected this season to just be harden isos and kd isos
pos,Pos,we desperately need kyrie to come back and hug kd
neg,Pos,deandre bembry and jevon carter playing like prime mj and pippen
pos,Pos,dayron sharpe hit a 3 so basically the league is fucked
neg,Pos,casey is a bad coach killian hayes was playing well so he gets 7 second half minutes because we need to develop 30 year old corey joseph apparently
pos,Pos,i heard y all talking about me harden
neg,Pos,that sequence at the end of the 3q when harden hit five quick assists on consecutive plays in 2 minutes was a masterclass in playmaking efficiency his raise the roof gesture to the crowd after the bembry alley oop was the cherry on top
pos,Pos,cade
pos,Pos,it s hard to believe these teams are competing in the same league it had the feel of when alabama plays furman or something
pos,Pos,reports of hardens demise have been greatly exaggerated
pos,Pos,they really doubled cam the whole time he was on
pos,Pos,the highlight of the season to me will be casey being fired i cant stand this shit coach stop playing cojo too much i just cant assume why he loves and plays cojo too much
neg,Pos,durant going for the gordie howe hat trick gotta respect it
pos,Pos,hayes diallo might be the worst nba starting back court of the last decade jesus
neg,Pos,harden coming in hot in those 3 quarters we love to see it
pos,Pos,harden and kd are a top 2 duo in the league without a doubt
neg,Pos,nets tonight with 65 52 62 shooting splits
pos,Pos,what was with the kd elbow to olynyk tho lol
neg,Pos,maann fuck kelly olynick shoutout to harden triple double anyway nice to see the rookies getting some burns
pos,Neg,is it just me or floor spacing is much better after durant is ejected
pos,Pos,wow lamarcus playing again thought he retired
pos,Pos,cade has a war of 1 0
pos,Pos,crazy that of all players with 100 minutes so far this season sengun has the highest steal rate in the whole league
pos,Pos,carmelo is the 4th best player on the lakers resurgence
neg,Pos,run offense through melo fuck it
pos,Pos,staples center melo is goated
pos,Neg,i mean i ll take the w but this shit was ugly to watch
pos,Pos,russ with a team high 25 second highest were lebron carmelo 7
pos,Pos,this was certainly a basketball game i guess
pos,Pos,melo has shot 24 46 from 3 this season
pos,Pos,they re using jalen green like hes pj tucker
pos,Pos,i miss having a point guard
pos,Neg,no matter what is said about this team i just wanna shoutout carmelo i don t know if this level of play is sustainable but he s playing ridiculously hard he wants that championship so damn bad i hope we can get it for him
neg,Pos,mercifully this one is over
neg,Neg,melo playing so well bron and ad hyped everytime melo hits
pos,Pos,ok kpj is not a pg at all please stop forcing jalen green to play next to him
pos,Pos,ah well take the w and look to checks schedule the rockets in 2 days
pos,Pos,malik unlimited range monk since declaring unlimited range 1 9 from 3
neg,Neg,it s baffling to me how little minutes kj martin has gotten this season so far 12 4 1 1 on 6 8 shooting with a 8 in 16 minutes is pretty damn efficient
pos,Pos,we will see what this team is when the schedule gets rough but a win is a win there is a lot of good shit going on with the offense if they can lock it down
pos,Neg,sometimes shot just don t fall quite proud of the defensive effort even if we slipped a little in the 4th bron gonna have a career low on shooting s this year i think touch around the rim isn t looking as good and he s not getting the calls he usually would so it s not really balancing out
pos,Pos,25 for russ
pos,Pos,crazy to see melo and kenyon martin jr there together at the end his dad used to play with melo on the knicks
neg,Pos,melo 24 46 on 3 s for the season 52 lakers really got olympics melo
neg,Neg,spread was at 10 5 lot of ppl lost their parleys tonight including me
pos,Pos,russ with that plus minus tho
pos,Pos,that was some terrible offense from the rocket first 3 quarters
neg,Neg,nobody won this game
pos,Pos,rockets 54 points through 3 quarters 31 in the 4th it looked like it shouldve been over but the starters had to come back really close game despite 25 turnovers and 14 missed free throws by the rockets
pos,Pos,lebron getting his 3pt average back on track with another 0 6
pos,Neg,gotta question how long christian wood is willing to ride it out with these rockets he s entering his prime and this team is nowhere near competitive in any sense he doesn t fit the rebuilding timeline at all
neg,Pos,
neg,Neg,rockets had waaaay too many turnovers they were on track to break the record at some point lol
pos,Pos,i don t see a westbrook thread so i m going to go out on a limb and say he play a fairly did game
pos,Pos,i know it s a small sample size but rockets are definitely the worst team this year
pos,Pos,road to champions 79 3
neg,Neg,lehungover
pos,Pos,the best part of having russ and melo on this team is it makes us way more likable
pos,Neg,offense looked nice today we need to cut out that 3rd quarter bs out tho
pos,Pos,man this was a brutal nightcap game to watch lol
pos,Pos,nice to see a reprieve from the russ hate
pos,Neg,that was 1970 s basketball at its finest
pos,Pos,this was a game lmao ugly game with some really memorable moments
neg,Pos,in melo s mind right now man why did i wait so long to team up with lebron i would ve had open looks my entire career and would ve been the best spot up shooter ever
pos,Pos,melo is 11th in the league in 3 pointers made lol he s shooting 50 from 3 lebron is 6th i m pretty sure melo is leading the league in scoring off the bench not counting herro who is getting starter minutes
neg,Pos,my observations for jalen green it s not the missing shots that worries me it s that he can t even take advantage when reaves was guarding him one on one he is also surprisingly limited offensively it s either difficult step back 3s or running full speed inside and throw himself in the air hoping to get a call he needs to learn to use rymthm sometimes slow down not just run on one gear also that dribble is suspect and needs a lot of work shot form needs work too don t even get me started on his defense he gets bullied by everyone and he got out run by lebron and westbrook in a chasedown at least try to foul them instead of letting him dunk on you on scouting report he had a 9 for nba ready score mobley had 8 but he is no where close to that there s some false advertising there for his nba readiness
neg,Neg,that ending tho sheesh
neg,Pos,carmelo been ballin
pos,Pos,these lakers are the laziest team i ve ever seen
neg,Neg,bron played 35 mins and bitched for about 45 mins this game
pos,Pos,3 top 75 players 1 debated top 75 player 1 former mvp championship or bust
pos,Pos,the lakers really do have a bunch of roleplayers returning from injuries soon and a great coach that will get them to properly defend and two supporting all nba players in westbrook and davis and lebron fucking james and somehow the nba media people convinced yall casuals that this team isn t the favourite
neg,Neg,russ was 2 rebounds and an assist away from a good game unfortunate on to the next
pos,Pos,this was a bad lakers win
pos,Pos,such a easy schedule the los geriatrics will face the rockets again the next game no back to backs either like lillard who is currently struggling with a shooting slump having to play 2 days on a roll it feels like disney all over again nice
pos,Pos,this game was awful
pos,Pos,lebron lookin like hot garb
pos,Neg,lakers had 20 more fga and it was still kinda close
pos,Pos,westbrook 25 2 to book it
pos,Pos,2 bottom teams no real winner sadly
pos,Pos,league is less fun when the lakers win
neg,Neg,gross
neg,Neg,sister melo in the post game on court interview
neg,Pos,stay me7o
neg,Pos,lebron with the rey mysterio shooting night
neg,Neg,having 4 different players who can score 20 on any given night is a huge advantage and carmelo anthony has been delivering in terms of scoring lal will definitely need someone from the bench who can pick up the scoring if lebron ad and westbrook are having tough shooting nights like tonight
neg,Pos,bron and melo combined for 6 steals and 5 blocks good lord
pos,Pos,lemelo
pos,Pos,we only win games where melo scores well i had no idea we would rely on him this much the big 3 have more fga than points
neg,Pos,vegas making the 11 is amazing to me
pos,Pos,melo the laker legend
pos,Pos,sixth man of the year carmelo anthony pretty much at this point it s a big 4 now
pos,Pos,looking down that lakers roster is always such a trip
pos,Pos,mans couldn t miss tonight meko is gonna be goated post this season
pos,Pos,lakers melo might be the new hoodie melo he stay getting buckets
pos,Pos,so melo is gonna win 6moty
neg,Pos,gonna be a tough year for the rockets
pos,Pos,hornets have got qs 2 4 figured out let s try in q1
pos,Neg,people will talk about the refs whatnot but i just hope we never see jarrett allen again tbh man destroyed us tonight
neg,Neg,the triple towers cannot be stopped
neg,Neg,rubio with the classic 1 7 23 rubio line hes not a good shooter but he is a good player
pos,Pos,cavs are good
pos,Pos,theyre too tall man what rebels to nba standards
pos,Pos,i think the cavs deserve some serious credit everybody said allen mobley wouldn t work and what the hell are the cavs doing and it s not only working very well but it s incredibly fun to watch also we ve all heard the term home cooking from refs whatever the word is for the opposite of that is what happened to the hornets tonight good lord that was bad
pos,Pos,uh oh
pos,Pos,bickerstaffs short rotations give me anxiety guys are playing huge minutes and look gassed at times almost caught up to them tonight
pos,Pos,very successful road trip all things considered excited to see more of these young cavs
pos,Pos,glad to see markkanen playing well
neg,Pos,rubio 5 points 8 assists 2 steals 1 rebound and 23 a classic rubio statline really
neg,Neg,evan mobley
pos,Pos,this cavs team is so frustrating to watch we keep dominating to start games and then spend the next 40 minutes shitting the bed at least in this game we learned to intermittently stop shitting the bed so that we win that said as a cavs fan only 40 minutes of shitting the bed is incredibly refreshing also as a side note how do you generate post game threads i always come here right after cavs games and i watch most of the cavs games so if i can i d be happy to get these up a little faster i think there d be a lot more discussion if we got these sooner after the games end
neg,Pos,nba is not for smol bois cavs
pos,Pos,damn gotta be scared of every team in the east now
neg,Pos,east runs through the cavs
neg,Neg,jarrett allen should be an all star this year i will hear no arguments against it
neg,Pos,oubre follows up a 26 7 5 game shooting 57 1 54 5 50 0 with a 2 4 1 game shooting 12 5 0 0 n a the duality of man
pos,Pos,i never ever want to play the hornets they just never go away if it s not lamelo it s scary terry if you manage to get them both off the court you ve got gordon hayward kelly oubre and miles bridges stretching the floor sheesh finishing the road trip from hell 3 2 is nothing short of amazing i m not going to get ahead of myself and proclaim the cavs to be a good team but i don t think finishing close to 500 is out of the realm of possibility gg hornets
pos,Neg,hornets tried really hard and scored like 4 3s in a row late in the 4th but cavs managed to hold on very good win for a positive and hard road trip cavs need to improve 3pt shooting to reach next level
pos,Pos,mah man allen
pos,Pos,gg hornets we both have fun young guys that will only get better down the line i fuckin love mobley and ball scares the shit out of me
neg,Neg,oh how we miss you ja
neg,Neg,excited that mobley is playing well but as a cavs fan i am hoping his performances stay under the radar he s a few 20 pieces away from every other headline about us reading will evan mobley refuse cavs rookie extension and seek trade to insert big market
neg,Neg,
neg,Neg,lamelo ball is so good and he s only 20 years old it s insane
pos,Pos,jarret allan is a monster this season
neg,Pos,ya ll weren t ready for tall ball
pos,Pos,i love tall ball
pos,Pos,this game was big time scary terry and big ball hour in the fourth those dudes could not miss for a while really impressive even though they came up a bit short watching allen dominate especially in that first quarter was really fun to watch when he is on he finishes everything near the basket very happy after this road trip
pos,Pos,wow never thought lemelo is that good
pos,Pos,yes sirrr tallball is the future babyy our average height should be 7 ft soon
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,wall sheena has just fallen
neg,Pos,this game hurts miles bridges mvp case
pos,Pos,someone posted here that the incredible efficiency of bridges would be sustainable he was 4 18 today
pos,Pos,denver readying their jokic bolbol mpj lineup
pos,Pos,everyone s taking about the bulls and wizards being good but what shocks me the most is the cavs being not ass
pos,Pos,from someone who watches just about every hornets game since the mid 00s this is by far the worst most one sided officiated game i ve seen 38 free throws to 15 hacking miles left and right no calls breathing on the cavs foul city gtfo with this garbage officiating
neg,Pos,
pos,Neg,oubre back to his old ways love it
pos,Pos,the rampant overdose of refball aside we can t go down 20 in the first quarter and expect to win oh and can the front office pretty please find us a fucking center as bad as that one season with howard was at least he could rim protect and bully rebounds if he gave a shit that night
pos,Pos,where are the buzz buzzes at
pos,Neg,how does a big man only have three blockouts
neg,Neg,9 13 from ja ugh that s going to bring his percentages dwn
pos,Pos,why is lauri so bad
pos,Pos,levert seriously makes us so much better
neg,Pos,let jock play
pos,Pos,don t let the final score fool you it was much worse of a beatdown than that
neg,Neg,hot take i enjoy being a pacers fan more when the team shoots 60 50 80
neg,Neg,it may not look like levert had a good game but he really made the game so much easier for everyone else when he s in it seems like everyone fits into their positions a lot more naturally hopefully we get a couple guys back soon and can start getting a few more wins in the books
neg,Neg,i will never understand why sabonis played 36 minutes in this game
neg,Neg,the pacers plan to just shoot the ball at a 60 70 clip may be the one they need
pos,Pos,damn pacers i know you needed a blow out after all those close games this year but couldn t you miss a few shots
neg,Pos,i didnt expect this at all the pacers blew us out of the water from the start we did our best but the pacers where on another level today good on them
pos,Pos,a burn the tape kind of game tbh thank you pavers for contributing to the san antonio for chet holmgren fund
pos,Pos,well that was shit apart from landale getting minutes he s ready come on pop say adios to eubanks and hola to landale
neg,Neg,what the actual fuck we didn t even play that bad the pacers just shot like prime warriors with two draymonds in the middle that was insane edit i will concede we had dumb turnovers that were very unlike us as well
neg,Neg,can t complain much when the opponent shoot 99 off the field lmao legimately props to y all pacers gg we will looked bad this gsme tho onto the next one with hopefully the right mentality to play
pos,Pos,pacers are really underrated they ve played a tough schedule so far and i believe they will make a run for the playoffs
neg,Neg,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray
neg,Neg,this is certainly a popular matchup
neg,Neg,i need to pick the first game of every week for sabonis from now on in my fantasy league
pos,Pos,yyeeeeeaaahhhh booooyyyyy
pos,Pos,doc has unlocked drummond s all star potential forget dame bring on the embiid drummond twin tower old school 80s 90s style
pos,Pos,hahaha who even needs a starting five doc and his all bench lineups taking over the league
neg,Neg,dame has the suds there s no other explanation
pos,Pos,did i miss something i didn t watch the game how the fuck did the blazers lose to that starting 5
pos,Pos,our depth is so underrated last year mike scott would have gotten 30 minutes and dwight would have fouled out in the first half and we would have lost
pos,Pos,niang is the man really great win considering our three max players didn t step on the court and our sf left in the third
neg,Pos,how do you lose to the sixers who are without simmons embiid harris and green for half the game
neg,Pos,clap your hands
pos,Pos,sixers looking good what are the blazers plan
pos,Pos,forget the kyrie drama forget simmons 14 15 7 with 5 stl drummond is the most insane thing i ve seen in a hot minute
pos,Pos,trust the damn process
neg,Pos,honestly so impressed to see this without 3 max contracts probably the best playmaking game of tyrese maxeys career he looked like a point guard here for the first time good defense on dame too fantastic outing for niang who has been such a massive boost for the bench drummond gets a lot of hate but for a minimum contract it s such a great backup situation on nights embiid has to sit he s competent enough to have some big games like tonight that directly help with a win underatedly nice offseason pickups here
pos,Pos,we got depth this year
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,we dont need dame we got niang
pos,Pos,me dope game lemme check the highlights on r nba r nba a norman powell and 1 and a clip of fans chanting for dame
pos,Pos,dame atleast abandoned the three and got to the rim consistently thybulle did a great job denying him late awesome 3rd quarter no timeouts
pos,Pos,curry beats dame again
pos,Pos,prepare some copium for the lakers fans about to see drummond s statline
neg,Pos,wearing a counterfeit portland jersey and fake mustache lillard washed trade him for ben simmons
pos,Pos,blazers need to make changes and i m not saying that in a selfish i want dame way they just can t compete with the west right now
neg,Neg,guys my copium tank is running low what do i do
neg,Pos,we suck again
neg,Neg,other teams don t you regret not signing georges niiiaannnnnnnngg
neg,Pos,so the blazers just stink this year i thought they were gonna rail us with everyone out
pos,Pos,pull up a chair blazers thunder is cookin up some burgers and pels grabbin the drinks
pos,Pos,george niang was amazing tonight he plays like he has the city s heart
neg,Neg,i have no idea why the blazers would choose to keep this core if you cannot beat a sixers team with both embiid out and simmons deciding not to play and harris out as well that s a giant red flag
pos,Pos,dame boutta just stay in philly
pos,Pos,is lillard lowkey deliberately tanking his value so that he can get traded and then not get any slant for his loyalty stuff
pos,Pos,hey dame you re always welcome to stay
neg,Neg,blazers just got railed by the niang gang
pos,Pos,portland is in the mud paul reed
neg,Neg,this team is deep bruh god dam
pos,Pos,drummond and niang put in a damn shift tonight
pos,Pos,seth curry getting 17 fga and 10 3pa he deserves as the team s best shooter
pos,Pos,that fucking ruled that game was so fucking fun niang gang seth goated kork god
pos,Neg,how tf did the blazers lose this game
pos,Pos,we were missing 3 5 starters and blazers still managed to lose
pos,Pos,sixers are being overlooked in my opinion they have a better team than last season now imagine if ben comes back with an improved offensive game
pos,Pos,any blazers fan could ve told you we lose these types of games sixers best three players are out danny green injured mid game the smart money always goes against portland
neg,Pos,seth curry is fucking good
pos,Pos,process me the fuck up thats some good process right th ere right there if i do saү so my self i say so thats what im talking about trust the process me right now chorus process mmmmmꮇм нo0оଠｏooｏoоଠଠooooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ sam hinkie is my daddy
pos,Pos,gonna nut
pos,Pos,what s up with dame has he just given up cause it seems like he s not giving it his all
pos,Pos,just blow the blazers team up enough chances have been given and they are just garbage beyond belief
pos,Pos,portland could go 0 82 and they still wouldn t blow it up what an embarrassment of a loss
pos,Pos,portland is officially a walking disaster that s as bad of a loss as you will see in the regular season
neg,Neg,dame is shooting 23 from 3 now while russ is shooting 25 from 3 although both teams have similar records lol
pos,Pos,it s time to be legitimately worried about damian lillard
neg,Neg,on the bright side portland can save on buying dame s return ticket
neg,Neg,me a blazers fan damn guess we should trade dame
pos,Pos,this is revenge for last year s game when the blazers had all their starters out
pos,Pos,it s been brick time for dame to start this season sheesh legit what s going on with him is he injured
pos,Pos,trust the process
pos,Pos,it s not only the poor roster construction for portland it s also how they play zero ball movement iso after iso and just turnstile defense
pos,Pos,dame selling on purpose so he can get traded lmao
pos,Pos,lillard and picks for simmons
neg,Neg,the blazers are terrible
pos,Pos,another lame time
neg,Neg,lame time
pos,Pos,blazers need to process seriously
neg,Pos,lol what how did blazers lose
pos,Pos,damn
pos,Neg,andre drummond with the sauce
pos,Pos,go home everybody all nba drummond with the almost quad double haha 14 15 7 5
neg,Neg,tonight was much more a showing of how smooth the offense is without tobi than people will want to admit
neg,Neg,blazers how you were fully loaded
pos,Pos,maxey is playing himself into being very near untouchable in any trade scenario take ben and matisse and any picks you want i want to watch maxey mature on the sixers dude could very well be a star
pos,Pos,drummond with a 14 15 7 5 1 statline in a w is not what i expected to happen this season
pos,Pos,drummond had 7 assists and 5 steals what
neg,Neg,no embiid lol trade dame already
pos,Pos,how you let georges niang beat you
pos,Pos,blazers fans if you ask really nicely maybe we ll let you have georges niang for dame straight up
pos,Pos,welcome to the doc rivers experience he will definitely get the best out of his players in the regular season that s what he s best exceeding expectations in the regular season then blow it in the playoffs
neg,Pos,seth curry for dame who says no
pos,Pos,powell and simons shouldve gotten more shots when cj and dame were cold
neg,Pos,dame and picks for ben
neg,Neg,been a while since we got a lottery pick
neg,Neg,haven t watched a single portland game is dame forcing his way out
neg,Pos,luckily the blazers have given me every reason to be completely apathetic towards them because this loss would probably have been very annoying otherwise
neg,Neg,dame doesn t feel like dame
pos,Pos,i love portland but man this transition is rough right now they re passing more which is leading to more turnovers can t wait until the offense is clicking and lillard is out of his slump
pos,Pos,man roco killing my fantasy team this year
pos,Pos,dame time fourthkan korkmaz
pos,Pos,lame time back at it again with another lame ass performance
pos,Pos,changing coaches was a bad move for portland
pos,Pos,blazers are ass cheeks dame just needs to leave i m a believer in the abbott theory that the report was right and he just got cold feet
pos,Pos,i wouldnt even give wiggins up for lame time
pos,Pos,hearing portland fans whinge like only they do after a win is always fun
pos,Pos,either dame is injured or he needs to be embarrassed with his performances so far
pos,Pos,did you hear those chants dame come home baby
neg,Pos,this means we win dame right
pos,Pos,portland sucks and its time to blow it up but dame doesn t get an excuse for playing this bad against this team didn t look like a lot of effort on each side
pos,Neg,portland are embarrassingly bad
pos,Pos,yea if only someone could have predicted
pos,Pos,what the fuck happened to dame
pos,Neg,the blazers will never win anything and dame isnt doing anything to prove hes the guy that will help them do it either
pos,Pos,i have a hard time believing the blazers can be this lazy already
neg,Pos,role players plus ben auditioning for their new team
pos,Pos,get norm some help jeez
pos,Pos,blazers had 3 scorers with 20 points so that s good news
pos,Pos,wtf was that
neg,Neg,how has larry been
pos,Pos,is covington washed
pos,Pos,i fucking love this team
pos,Pos,i would die for niang
pos,Pos,fire scott brooks
pos,Pos,i m starting to think this cam reddish guy is pretty good
pos,Pos,fun ecf preview
pos,Pos,both these teams really need to improve their free throw defense
neg,Neg,45 45 fts is absolutely nuts kuzma fouling at the end had me nervous for the stat
pos,Pos,i honestly don t know what is a foul anymore we are also so jekyll and hyde so far this year in terms of home away jc earning every bit of his contract so far and continues to get better every year
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,i m genuinely have no idea what s a foul anymore first half all ticky tack fouls then second half barely any calls someone pump fakes and bumps the defender no call then next play someone does the exact same thing and it gets called i don t care what the rule is either way but we need some consistency
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,cam reddish
pos,Pos,what a miserable third quarter lol perfect fts though
pos,Pos,finally we played like we want to win even with beal going nuts for a minute there great win boys and way to turn it around after saturday and thursday
pos,Pos,skwahhhhh
pos,Neg,nique made the greatest hawk squak to make sure a free throw went in please someone have that clip
pos,Pos,edit idk why records are not identical to the records they have currently but just live through it
neg,Pos,this game was way more like it
pos,Pos,oh fuck you re gonna make me roll the clip
pos,Pos,the wizes depth didnt show up bonehead isolation moves by brad on to the next
neg,Neg,i feel like trae is still bad but not really a contender for worst defender in the league anymore
neg,Neg,unpopular opinion time i challenge anyone to watch this game tonight and tell me that they reliably know what a shooting foul or charge is under the new officiating system like sure the game flow is better but as an observer it s incredibly frustrating to see obvious contact on drive after drive that doesn t get called and then in the 4th quarter things that weren t fouls magically are for some reason and i m saying this for both sides i d personally rather have frequent stoppages with calls that i can at least understand consistently
pos,Neg,that was a good game
pos,Neg,bogi finally got more shots only 9 tho lol and was great 5 9 best index best minus with 6 6 assist rebounds and no to s should be 2nd option in hawks
pos,Pos,i d like to start the narrative that trae young isn t a net negative defender
pos,Pos,we not 5 3 tf
neg,Neg,hawks are 4 3 and wizards are 5 2
neg,Neg,the hawks and the wizards were perfect from the free throw line collectively shooting 45 45 this was the 5th game in nba history where neither team missed a free throw
neg,Pos,damn r nba wants us to lose so bad they give us an imaginary loss
neg,Pos,hawks finally look like we suppose to
pos,Pos,beal really is a empty calorie scorer isn t he
pos,Pos,u thesebitcheslovesoba
pos,Pos,gafford needs to stop getting into early foul trouble let s not make this a thing i love having trezz out there and all but give him a break
pos,Pos,we are 5 2 not 5 3 put some mafuckin spec on our name
pos,Pos,the celtics started the 4th quarter up 103 89 they were then outscored fucking 39 to 11
neg,Pos,demar entering his prime in 2021
neg,Pos,love to see ayo with that 6 6 on fg
pos,Pos,first 3 quarters the defense everyone said we had before the year 4th q the defense we thought we had after the first 6 games
pos,Pos,ayoooo dosunmu the hometown boy strikes again
pos,Pos,siracha
pos,Pos,demar i say it da more i like it
pos,Pos,at the end of the 3rd i went to do some stuff and when i came back it was 106 105 i thought i was watching an old replay or a different game also ayo at 38 was a steal best second rounder so far
pos,Pos,home safely chicago beep beep
pos,Pos,bulls are legit af bandwagoners welcome i know none of y all watch us
pos,Pos,lol 11 points i saw the score after the 3rd and i thought both boston and the raps were gonna dethrone the top what the heck happened
pos,Neg,derozan and lavine on the same team is actually unfair wtf
pos,Pos,bulls ayo the vooch deballzach
pos,Pos,fuck all the people saying the demar signing was bad
pos,Pos,the boston celtics are down terrible
pos,Neg,yall remember when lonzo was getting clowned 45 min ago and this was a blowout
pos,Neg,can we give billy donavan credit for getting this team to mesh so well together despite such a huge roster turnover
neg,Neg,shout out derrick jones jr for some amazing defense on tatum and brown in the 4th
pos,Pos,i love this team so much it hurts
pos,Pos,39 11 in the 4th quarter the celtics should be embarrassed congrats chicago y all got a real good squad
pos,Pos,bulls is 4 real and lonzo ball is turning into the perfect 3 d point guard
pos,Pos,yo i straight up hate basketball
pos,Pos,ayo is not just a player he s an idea
neg,Pos,mfers really said demar derozan was the worst move in fa this off season 9 points in the 4th pre garbage time is inexcusable god damn
pos,Pos,chicago miami and new york all around the top of the east is it 2013 again
neg,Pos,tatum lowkey been ass this season
pos,Neg,this is the best bulls team of all time
pos,Pos,bulls are watchable now can we please get a christmas game nba gods
neg,Pos,4th quarter blitz
neg,Neg,ayo donsunmu is a first round pick we only gave up one frp for vooch league fucked
neg,Pos,ay where s that dumb bitch john hollinger fuck you fucking bean counter
neg,Neg,man ayo really fell to the second round that dude is a gamer
neg,Pos,only one 5 1 team remains now good job bulls they woke up in the 4th and put the celtics away still not underestimating them when we play celtics could blow us out for all i know
pos,Pos,we want bama
pos,Pos,lost my bulls broadcast stream and had to suffer through the celtics broadcaster saying he thought the bulls were not a good team and he thought the comeback against the knicks was a fluke
pos,Neg,how did 37 guys get picked ahead of dosunmu did anyone watch him in college
pos,Pos,lavine is a fucking amazing player he s a top 15 talent never had a chance to show it due to being on awful teams super stoked for lavine
pos,Pos,hmmm
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,i can t fathom how this team keeps getting worse every year are brown and tatum get better
pos,Pos,bill simmons in shambles
pos,Pos,lol the celtics announcers talking shit when they were up late in the 3rd
neg,Pos,what a historically bad collapse 39 11 fourth quarter what the fuck something is really wrong with the celtics
neg,Pos,i will never turn off another bulls game again no matter how far they are down
pos,Pos,avert your eyes celtics deballzach is on full display
pos,Pos,same shit different day week month season watching this team just flat out sucks like 80 of the time they are lifeless despite having so much potential it s like watching porn with a soft 7 inch dick
pos,Pos,this boston team is not a playoff team
pos,Pos,oh my god that deebo line 15 20 3 4 4 5 in my veins
neg,Pos,ayo is legit
neg,Neg,come here boy and let me pinch those cheeks stacey king
pos,Pos,tatum got the r nba highlight but we got the win lonzo ball
pos,Pos,we are the best team in the league
pos,Pos,hey guys it s me some guy who only watched the first three quarters those celtics sure look like they re gelling huh might call them spooky
neg,Pos,the east runs through bulls
pos,Pos,fun game good comeback bulls are exciting
pos,Pos,the bulls are nice man
pos,Neg,just ordered my number 12 jersey as a university of illinois student and chicago native i could not be more excited right now unless of course we didn t lose to loyola
pos,Pos,gg bulls very good team you have
neg,Neg,didn t watch the game what happened in the 4th

pos,Pos,hell of a fucking win

pos,Neg,this one felt goooooood
pos,Pos,the bulls are a lot better than i thought they were boston commentators boston defence and hustle was non existent in the 4th

pos,Pos,bulls are a 3 seed at least
neg,Neg,marcus starting point guard smart with 0 assists
pos,Pos,holy cow look at that 4th quarter derozan was flawless once again and lavine took it to the rack when his shot wasn t falling bulls looking scary
pos,Pos,ayo is blowing me away early on as a rook he does make normal rookie mistakes at times but he brings such a good energy off the bench along with caruso djj thank goodness for all of them work to be done but thrilled to beat a good team via comeback boston will be just fine on the road e feel bad leaving out alize javonte troy brown our bench isn t perfect but they bust their asses it s not going unnoticed
neg,Neg,this bulls team is so damn good to watch it s great seeing them compete again
pos,Pos,the worst free agency acquisition demar derozan accoring to gms just dropped a back 2 back 30 piece
pos,Pos,doubting us mother fuckers it only makes us stronger are coming for your fucking team

pos,Pos,good shit demar
pos,Pos,demar derozan
neg,Neg,i m hyped neil funk
pos,Neg,i love this team
neg,Pos,the difference in level between tatum and brown isn t as wide as people may believe brown is right there with him
neg,Neg,bulls are not spooky they are just flat out good
pos,Pos,what makes ayo even better is how easy it is to scream his name ayoooooo
pos,Pos,bulls are legit
pos,Pos,i m glad the bulls are able to witness daddy demar he s a treasure
pos,Pos,on one hand it s early in the season on the other hand lotion
pos,Pos,so exciting see the bulls do well hope they continue this trend
neg,Neg,monumental collapse by the celtics you love to see it
neg,Pos,udoka makes nash look like popovich
pos,Pos,demar with 37 zach with 22 in just the second half this team is a bucket
pos,Pos,celtics genuinely do not look playoff caliber
pos,Pos,how did boston lose this game wtf
pos,Pos,moo motherfuckers
pos,Neg,demar derozan baby
pos,Pos,it s so refreshing to have a genuinely good team we ain t even healthy either
pos,Pos,ayyyyyyyyoooooooo
pos,Pos,bulls are contenders and boston looks absolutely cooked
pos,Pos,where u jaylen01 27 20 at dudes the saltiest weirdo on this sub
pos,Neg,11 points in the fourth quarter baby that s what this sport is all about love my celtics
pos,Pos,not enough love in here for the goat of goats caruso s energy defense passing and shooting fueled the run
pos,Pos,down 19pts in the 3rd and won the game by double digits damn the bulls are fucking legit
pos,Pos,so uh any room left in the chet holmgren sweepstakes
pos,Pos,and if you said boston would struggle to avoid the play ins in the summer you d get downvoted everytime
pos,Pos,the jump shooting of tatum and brown before the 4th was insane
pos,Pos,bulls they re too good man i know i saw them they re going to kill us man we can t do this i know i saw them
pos,Neg,i fucking despise this team i could type a five page essay with the problems with udoka alone nevermind the inability to play four quarters of a game which this team has struggled to do since 2018
pos,Pos,take a look at those numbers on the bulls bench some times those stats can be misleading they were not today
pos,Pos,lets go bulls
pos,Pos,the jays need to develop their playmaking or the c s are never going anywhere i actually understand the kyrie kemba experiments
pos,Pos,how do you go from 14 up to 14 down in one fucking quarter
pos,Pos,someone remind me the last time we beat the celtics
pos,Pos,
neg,Neg,ayo is for real
pos,Neg,how tf did ayo drop down so far in the draft
neg,Neg,demar is so nice
neg,Pos,what a fucking fourth quarter
pos,Pos,chicago might be my favorite team right now they re legitimately fun to watch
pos,Pos,barring injuries bulls are gonna pull a suns this year long playoff drought influx of stars means teams have to design a new defensive plan to guard them on the go and they have the offensive power to beat atlanta and philly
pos,Pos,we have finally avenged the huskies loss 75 years ago
pos,Pos,everyone but rj has to walk home
pos,Pos,raptors rebuild took 2 weeks
neg,Neg,looking like another year where betting the over for the raptors looks promising
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,great game we got outplayed hard raptors looked great even missing players they are absolutely a threat being slept on this year in general the parity in the league has felt insane this year there are very few teams i feel are a safe win plenty of teams that are a deep threat i feel like there are like 8 teams in the east you could tell me will win the championship and i wouldn t call you crazy
pos,Pos,does this mean we beat a good team the raps damn near choked us out i m here for the return of the north
neg,Neg,gtj killing it these past games
pos,Pos,rj can only do so much all well gg raptors crazy good defense on another note thank god for the hawks at least we re not the only team falling off in standings and celtics y all are ass bro y all couldn t win just this one game
pos,Pos,og anunoby
pos,Pos,as hot as we got we still only shot 33 from 3 lol i love it
pos,Pos,og s contract of 4 72 is a steal and a half masai you beautiful bastard
pos,Pos,without siakam and barnes too gg
pos,Pos,are the raptors good
pos,Pos,only managed to catch the back half of the game but wow did khem impress me so much hustle
pos,Pos,that was legit one of the best all around team games i can remember watching
pos,Pos,ahhh drunk and disappointed this is home
pos,Pos,never underestimate the heart of a champion
pos,Pos,gg raptors rj had a good game so i m happy lol
neg,Pos,man gary trent jr is amazing to watch raptors just wanted it more than us tonight and it showed on the offensive boards randle gotta let the game come to him and move off the ball more something he can funny enough learn from rj but gg raptors hope to see og and rj in the all star game this year
neg,Pos,that was a throwback kyle demar comeback esque win
neg,Pos,og my sweet sweet prince
neg,Neg,rj put up career high 35 og was like k puts up career high 36
pos,Pos,that s the last game birch will ever come off the bench for us
neg,Neg,sometimes you bing and sometimes you get bonged
pos,Pos,that s sir anunoby to you
pos,Pos,feed rj you cowards
pos,Neg,i m here to overreact the raptors are going to the finals and winning with a fmvp performance from khem birch
pos,Neg,
neg,Neg,75 years ago today the knicks went to toronto at historic maple leaf gardens and beat the huskies 75 years later raptors go to new york at historic madison square garden and beat the knicks poetic really revenge is a dish best served cold
neg,Neg,thibs really got outthibs ed by a nurse
pos,Pos,no scottie no pascal no problem taking down first in the east lets fucking goooooooo
pos,Pos,sad bing bong
pos,Pos,shout out to svi for stepping up on both ends tonight
neg,Pos,i feel like barnes was almost invisible tonight overrated
neg,Neg,raptors need to shove birch into the starting lineup asap
pos,Pos,i know gtj can be streaky offensively but goddamn does he always bring it on d 4 steals tonight and just such a hassle to deal with
pos,Pos,if nick nurse didn t just win coty then they should retire the award forever
pos,Pos,well my prediction that the raps would struggle to break 70 points without siakam and barnes seems to have aged poorly
neg,Pos,knicks played like they were entitled of the win good on the raptors for smashing their mouth
neg,Pos,knicks got gassed and couldn t keep up
neg,Neg,um at least we re not the celtics tonight
pos,Pos,khem birch out to get that spot back from precious aichuwa
pos,Pos,one day this team will stop holding back rj when he s cooking and that ll be a glorious day
pos,Pos,every single person except rj is to blame absolutely pathetic again by the same individuals randle trying to play hero ball instead of team ball quickley being brickley fournier being a matador
pos,Pos,east runs through chicago and toronto
neg,Pos,playoff randle showed up after that 1st quarter
neg,Neg,quarters 2 4 were probably the worst we ve played under thibs the intensity and hustle was gross and then they basically just resorted to chucking and standing still on defence put that one in the bin
pos,Pos,we smoking that new york pack tonight ya heard
pos,Pos,raptors put the league on notice with that team performance fully healthy with siakam and barnes this team is gonna cause problems for anyone in the league with their length hustle and overall execution
pos,Pos,result doesn t count we didn t have scottie or siakam no yuta either
pos,Neg,ah nothing like having you hot streak ruined by a division rival makes the atlantic division more toxic and i love it
pos,Neg,should have known the first time it was fun being a knicks fan in 8 years would turn into the lowest hanging burn that s possible with all these reverse bing bongs
pos,Pos,no all star siakam no roty barnes no problem
neg,Pos,bing bong
neg,Pos,that game was every flaw the knicks have shown the last few games maximized and turned into a frustrating asskicking jeez at least rj played hard and continues to shine
neg,Neg,og coming out party this game such an amazing performance
neg,Neg,gtj got clamps hof now lmao
neg,Pos,we were downbad the first quarter i figured with no siakam barnes and yuta vs a better team it was a quick gg but og and gtj stepped up a fun game that was really back and forth in the 3rd quarter precious and boucher have been looking terrible the last couple games
pos,Neg,randle looks like my dad s dick i never saw my dad s dick but he looks like shit
pos,Neg,thought the raps would tank this year masai going for the championship
pos,Pos,ogggggggg
pos,Pos,ogugua anunoby
neg,Neg,sad bing bong
pos,Neg,raps got some dawgs on the team
pos,Pos,look at me i m the captain top team in the east now
pos,Pos,no such thing as a boring raptors game
pos,Pos,lets fucking go og and starboy live at msg
pos,Pos,no scottie no problem
pos,Pos,power rankings are wrong
pos,Pos,khem birch 20 baby new york city baby
neg,Pos,i love rj that s all folks
pos,Pos,freddie leading us in rebounding again as we all predicted
pos,Pos,og and demar both went off tonight great day to be a raptors fan
pos,Pos,career high 36 pts from og
pos,Pos,fun ass game everyone was hitting their threes
neg,Pos,i would be more pissed if it wasn t for rj he s growing into a star right fucking now
pos,Neg,two of our best players down for the game and nick nurse just proves he s op when the team keeps the turnovers low 24 assists 12 steals only 8 turnovers and one missed free throw all game great win tonight hats off to the knicks
neg,Pos,2019 2020 raptors back on the menu
pos,Pos,call this an overreaction but we are a playoff team if healthy
neg,Neg,i am the one who bing bongs
pos,Pos,everyone was calling that this was gonna be og s breakout season but can i take a moment to talk about our lord and savior gary trent f cking jr every game he hustles like a mfer and every game he goes even harder it s crazy
pos,Pos,bong welcome toronto
neg,Pos,get bing bonged
pos,Pos,huskies rubber match 75 years in the making
pos,Pos,gary trent was a menace today love that we got this guy for four more years
pos,Pos,randle scored an ice cold 4 points in the final 3 quarters 2 of which was in garbage time
pos,Pos,that was looking like a trap game good on the raps for not letting them pull off the upset
pos,Pos,dear nick bench precious thanks
neg,Neg,bing bong
neg,Pos,og breakout still on the menu boys
neg,Pos,what an absolutely fantastic win og with an incredible night making tough shots and guarding randle trent keeping his defensive pressure up and hitting some more huge shots fred keeping us composed with a few lapses late svi proving he deserved the start with some great plays and birch was incredible with his screens and rebounding against a big new york lineup and lastly nurse with some great line up adjustments and that fantastic out of timeout play gg new york glad rj had a good one too
pos,Neg,what a win for the boys career night for og and birch and gtj looked great all without pascal and scottie too
pos,Pos,once they put og on randle it changed the game
neg,Pos,is dragic gonna continue dnp until he gets waived
pos,Pos,well that was something else lmao
neg,Neg,rj is so underrated like he could be an all star this year with how hes playing
pos,Pos,this raptors team legit fr
pos,Pos,close out a sweet game after being down 16 and got to watch our homeboy rj ball out nice night for a raps fan
pos,Pos,by way of the uk og anunobing
pos,Pos,bro who are the commentators for nba tv they were saying this could be a trap game for the knicks since barnes is out fuck outta here raptors a solid team before barnes
neg,Neg,another game where we squander yet another double digit lead this time though like the magic game the raptors made sure to capitalize on our shortcomings in the 2nd half and we could never get back in the game
pos,Pos,obi toppin looked lost in the third and early fourth no fournier in the 4th quickley reluctant to shoot centers no where to be found in the paint when raptors ran small ball smh
pos,Pos,o i don t shoot trying to miss g
neg,Neg,that was so fucking satisfying i m cackling
neg,Pos,man like og dropped 36 points at the garden
pos,Pos,72 games on the road last year trained us for this
pos,Pos,khem birch with football passes screens rebounds doing it all
pos,Pos,we ve been playing so much better once nurse stopped playing dragic
neg,Neg,bing bong julius randle has left the game seriously he did fuck all after the first quarter
pos,Pos,props to khem monsta killa khem precious today
pos,Pos,23 more fg attempts
pos,Pos,great game randle looked ridiculous in the first quarter hard not to love this knicks team though imo but also knicks lol
neg,Neg,sigh sad bing bong noises
pos,Pos,the toronto raptors and orlando magic are the 2 best teams in the league better than those trash celtics bulls and 76ers rj barrett is a star that s my takeaway
pos,Pos,hey kawhi dont you regret not coming back to the raptoooooors
pos,Pos,bong
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,don t even care rj played amazing and the raps played really well our record is good and we re not even playing well yet
pos,Pos,lolknicks you just got owned by the raptors starting backcourt of red man meat hairy tent jr
pos,Pos,i m hittin the bing bong to celebrate that w
pos,Pos,lotta hot takes from knicks fans about their team chill bois y all still 5 2
pos,Pos,raptors are a well built team next man up mentality
neg,Pos,barrett goat
pos,Pos,fantastic defensive performance og and gtj balled out
pos,Pos,ogugua is so damn good
pos,Pos,i never want to think about the tampa bay raptors ever again
neg,Pos,steals and offensive rebounds is the raptors way if you cant hit your shots you better take a lot of them
pos,Pos,i knew we were in trouble when we were shooting lights out from 3 and only had a 4 point lead at the half
pos,Pos,precious is unfortunately going to be riding the bench once yuta and pascal come back
pos,Neg,fun game to watch after the knicks hit almost every shot in the first quarter it could have gone bad very quickly credit to the raptors for fighting through it but i do wonder if the knicks just making those crazy shots at the beginning worked in the raptors favor as it lulled them into a trap after going up 15
pos,Pos,shout out to svi
pos,Pos,wtf is bing bong lmao
pos,Pos,raptors were so active on d tonight knicks were starting their sets 35 ft from the hoop with 5 8 secs on the shot clock no easy buckets
pos,Pos,i guess the raptors might make the playoffs they d be a pretty hype play in game team
neg,Neg,this denver team is really hopeless when the mvp is off the court not to mention basically freezing him out in the fourth dont really get it but ill take it
pos,Pos,this is a really bad shooting team man
neg,Neg,really entertaining game grizzlies continue to be leaguepass heroes denver definitely could have shot better and won but i ll take it after miami shot fucking 70 from three until garbage time ja easily could have had 15 assists this game if people hit their shots he had some absolute dimes the double point guard lineup with ja and tyus ston3s was particularly dangerous tonight hopefully tyus can keep his confident shooting going
pos,Pos,man it s so nice to see ja just put games away
neg,Neg,ja morant that s it that s the post
neg,Pos,jokic is phenomenal but god damn i m i missing murray
pos,Pos,fking same story as last year the bench sucks while jok carries
neg,Pos,this was a team win holy shit everyone contributed tonight also now jenkins is at 500 for his win loss record that s our 500 coach and this is our 500 basketball team
pos,Pos,ja mvporant
neg,Pos,damn ja morant is really good
pos,Pos,why is jokic refusing to take shots in the 4th quarter like fucks sake stop playing good team basketball you twat your bum ass teammates will never make their open 3 s just shoot contested two s brother that s your team s bread and butter in the 4th
neg,Neg,reports of mpj s demise have been greatly under exaggerated
pos,Pos,mpj is gonna take a huge leap this year people are so sad rn it s me i m the sad guy
neg,Pos,the difference between ja and fox in kind of been staggering tbh in terms of play
pos,Pos,grizzlies looking nice i want ja in the playoffs again
neg,Pos,memphis are the real deal they are playing really well
pos,Neg,good bounce back from the lil baby hangover game
pos,Pos,not very encouraging considering nuggets shot 0 from 3 lol
pos,Pos,that was terrible bad shooting bad effort bad everything except nikola and kind of ag
pos,Neg,someone help jokic man
pos,Pos,best defense memphis played this season
neg,Neg,jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
pos,Neg,mpj not taking that leap yet this year he still could but it s going to be a long season for jokic get that man some help
pos,Pos,please no more facu
pos,Pos,woot
pos,Neg,nuggets are having a competition on who can miss the most 3s this season
pos,Pos,inexcusable from jokic how many shot attemps did he have in the 4th big guy do you have any idea how good you are bench ruined the game again along with mpj inexcusable from everyone today other than monte and ag
pos,Pos,mpj is really disappointing so far can you at least try to be more aggressive i get it s not completely your fault because jokic has the ball most of the game but demand your touches bro
neg,Pos,mpjr is playing so bad and hes hurting the team this is going to be the third week of his struggles
pos,Pos,can ja beat mitchell in the competition of mvp their skills are so identical and jazz has a higher ranking worrying about that
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,mpj with another quiet game
pos,Pos,yeah time for a jokic 50 piece in the next game
pos,Neg,i always enjoy playing a little game with myself of how far down r nba will i need to scroll to find the grizzlies postgame thread and lemme tell you it was pretty goddamn far for this one
neg,Pos,we re not gonna get a lot of wins this year let me just say this franz wagner lebron james
pos,Pos,suggs desperately needs a game either shooting over 50 or without a turnover he just hasn t looked right and is way too prone to mistakes right now in spurts still not an awful game from him hell of a game from the young guys and imo we continue to see how cole can easily be a winning player with high volume scoring
pos,Pos,excuse me do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior franz wagner
neg,Pos,franz wagner
pos,Pos,the nba is too easy for franz
pos,Pos,franz is so good it s wild and cole strikes again in minneapolis love to see it also the timberwolves announces are fantastic the one guy clearly watches a lot of college ball so knew all about our young guys lmao
neg,Pos,how do you go from winning by 6 to losing 43 19 to the magic wtf made their defense look like a fortress couldn t even hit free throws my parlay smh
pos,Pos,in the future they will say where were you when franz wagner got the ultra green light
neg,Neg,cole anthony dropping a casual 31 9 9 for as rough of a team as orlando is it really does seem like they are building something there just needs more time
pos,Pos,wagner can really ball man cole turning into a wolves killer too
pos,Pos,i m so happy for wendell man his time was running out here in chicago it s great that he landed with a franchise that s not in a rush will let him keep growing his game and will play him at the 4 with bamba at the 5 most important thing right now is staying healthy if he does he s got a long career ahead of him
pos,Pos,franz wagner has been very impressive
neg,Neg,franz mf wagner mods pls change my flair to him he s officially overtaken ty lue for goat
pos,Pos,also does anybody have more rim outs than jalen suggs every jumper he takes looks like it s going in then it rims out also shout out to coach mosely he finally shortened the rotation and played the starters more our starting 5 is legit for the most part
neg,Neg,we got franz cole killing it fultz has not returned ji has not returned suggs is off to a slow start yet is getting 5 plus rebounds assists and giving killer defense hustle chum bucket is warming up add next summer s lottery pick future is bright
pos,Pos,the game should ve ended on the spot after the franz dunk
neg,Neg,didn t think i d be looking at mock drafts this early this team isn t any different
pos,Pos,this team is just so fun to watch we aren t going to win a lot of games but our starting lineup actually plays amazingly together franz is a top 3 rookie so far
pos,Pos,two of the worst fourth quarter performances tonight that i ve seen in a while from the wolves celtics respectively
pos,Pos,hopium is back on the menu i guess
neg,Pos,the wolves are back
neg,Pos,wolves are back just when they start to trick us they go back into their peak embarrassment form not having talent is one thing but seeing a team simply give up is demoralizing to fans another zero effort night
pos,Pos,ok that was ugly to watch if our 3 point shot wasn t dropping apparently we don t have any other backup plans defense still looks ok more or less but we really need to figure out some way to get easy points
pos,Pos,how was my guy suggs
pos,Pos,suggs and wagner are real
pos,Pos,cole doing it all
pos,Pos,are the magic frisky now
neg,Neg,dlo only got 17mins was he that bad or did he get hurt
pos,Pos,at this point it s on finch just as much as the rest of the roster how are we struggling to score 100 points with this roster
pos,Pos,if you wanna give up 6 games in idk why you re a wolves fan but that really hurt
neg,Neg,3 things i took away from this game 1 the wolves offense is a self inflicted mess they force a ton of bad shots early in the shot clock for no real reason it also usually comes when they have the momentum which is why the wolves have had so much trouble closing out teams as much as i love ant he s been one of the biggest perpetrators of this i know that he can explode at any minute but he needs to recognize that we don t need him to go nuclear all the time in games where we have the lead there s no real reason to force an off the dribble 3 5 seconds into the shot clock finch needs to get ahold on this because ant isn t the only one and it has plagued us throughout the start of this season 2 in a game where jordan mclaughlin was absolutely cooked and highlighted just how much we need pat bev and dlo taurean prince was still by far the worst player on the court his shot isn t falling his defense is exposed by any player who has a semblance of athleticism and the amount of miscommunications he has with a teammate that leads to a turnover is startlingly high for this early in the season the stats in this game now are a bit skewed because of the magic s late 4th quarter surge but when this game was close in the 3rd he was like a 15 or something 3 the wolves will probably be alright they missed a ton of open looks tonight and this season that will start falling eventually but for a team that is a fringe playoff contender losses like these will come back to hurt you later on in the season credit to the magic who played great especially cole and franz but wolves were up 13 in the middle of the third quarter and should ve won this game finch needs to get a hold of this team because this is multiple games now where we ve thrown away a lead due to sloppy and erratic play
neg,Pos,alexa play ride of the valkyries
pos,Neg,the celtics lost the 4th quarter 39 11 at home wolves hold my beer proceeds to lose the 4th quarter 43 19 at home
pos,Pos,like someone said in the lamelo thread last night cole anthony needs his own article in the ringer give that man his flowers bill
neg,Pos,i m so sorry that cole anthony and franz wagner hate minnesota wolves fans wolves had lots of guys injured but we got some injuries too a w is a w gg
pos,Pos,dlo 3 points 1 8 from the field team high 15 gotta love single game plus minus
pos,Pos,i wish mo bamba could see the energy and effort rhe rest of the starters play with and match it also cole for mip franz for roy
pos,Pos,michigan fan here i was not expecting a game like this from franz this early in the season he was incredible this game
pos,Pos,is it too early to buy a franz wagner jersey
pos,Pos,bruh what did this team to the wagner family also cole anthony is insane magic bent us over tonight
pos,Pos,franz goated
pos,Pos,franz wagner owns minnesota
pos,Neg,was dlo as bad as his statline suggests or did something weird happen
pos,Neg,kat 16 fga 23 points ant 22 fga 24 points this is the damn problem give kat 6 more shots a game and it s a different world
pos,Pos,timberwolves got clapped you love to see it
neg,Neg,ayyy that s just wolves basketball babyyyy
pos,Pos,they were who we thought they were
pos,Pos,wtf happened to deangelo russell
neg,Pos,it s a cole world and we just livin in it
pos,Pos,so this looks like a repeat of last season s wolves collapse against the magic maybe early season magic come from behind win against the wolves will become a yearly tradition
pos,Pos,yeah tbh ben simmons prolly isn t even worth jaden mcdaniels like jordan mclaughlin and a 2028 second is prolly the limit with this much talent on the wolves roster
pos,Pos,wtf just happened
pos,Pos,hello darkness my old friend
pos,Pos,this is what i get for finally trusting timberwolves to win a game and betting on them
pos,Pos,they are who we thought they were
pos,Pos,after the denver and orlando games i think it s safe to say the wolves aren t good this year kat has completely forgotten how to post up no one on our team can rebound to save their life even when in position they tap the ball like a volleyball everyone on our team is streaky malik beasly might be our most consistent player on offense the ballhandling has been horrendous we can t use our athleticism because we have no bigs to clear up space in the paint we commit way too many stupid fouls
pos,Pos,franz has a chance to be a top 3 d guy maybe more
pos,Pos,remember when mcdaniels for simmons was a overpaid good times
pos,Neg,lol who loses to the orlando magic
neg,Neg,just want to preface this isn t hate on kat but i feel like i never get to see the hype like from what i ve seen off the court and from what people say kat seems cool and i like him but i feel like i never see him play good like apparently he was 23 24 from the line coming into this game and then while i m watching he misses his first 4 free throws it s just shit like that where he does all the awesome stuff while i m not watching edit i m not saying kat isn t good i m saying i m sad i don t get to see him be good though as person below me pointed out he had a good game tonight so it s probably a me problem where i only see the bad for some reason
pos,Pos,giddey and shai scoring for free baze hold my beer i m going 1v2 against pg and reggie
pos,Pos,despite eric bledsoe s best effort tank commander bazley clutched the l
pos,Pos,goddamn we had to reach into the recesses of our asshole to pull that win out
pos,Pos,bazley just making sure the okc tank rolls on with how bad he played in the 4th that s true dedication
pos,Pos,at least giddey and sga still look good together
pos,Pos,murdered by threes until the last two minutes start mann leave bledsoe in the locker room
pos,Pos,bazely going to iso against paul george with a minute left and immediately turning the ball over with a one on two basically sums up his basketball iq
pos,Pos,this is like the first time in forever since we clutched it out in the fourth
pos,Pos,when your last ditch effort is a muscala three it s gonna be a long season
pos,Pos,the clippers lost a 5 4 lead early in the first they didn t regain that lead until there was a minute left when they went up 93 92 great comeback in the fourth
pos,Pos,didn t think i would be this happy about a really close win over a team trying to lose but here we are
pos,Pos,that hurt josh giddey is super nice okc has zero bigs trade baze thunder up overall but i wish we won that
pos,Pos,pg and the bench fueled this win
pos,Pos,holy fuck bazley probably one of the worst performances i ve had the displeasure of seeing this season
pos,Pos,giddey had a great second half after being cold in the 1st he really competes and is underrated on defense
pos,Pos,the first 3 quarters were quite possibly the worst basketball i ve ever watched
pos,Neg,i know its not impressive but i needed this ty sam and tanking thunders after the warrior loss i said it was good loss this is a bad win we need to be better
pos,Pos,thunder may not have won but i have come out of this game considering myself a giddeysexual
pos,Pos,pg is a superstar go argue with your mom
neg,Pos,gotta give paul george playing out of his mind in the clutch bledsoe and bazley being cringe af for their respective teams
pos,Neg,okc in the last 3 minutes we really need to lose for the picks
pos,Pos,if the clippers make the playoffs paul george should really be in the mvp convo
pos,Pos,don t let the score fool you neither defense played well
pos,Pos,god bless you paul george
pos,Neg,that was quite possibly the worst game i ve ever seen in my life
neg,Pos,clips fans in staples so relieved on that one
pos,Pos,in the only game we really needed to win we decided to choke it on bazley drives and muscala three great if it was on giddey s or shai s misses i wouldn t care but that was just horrible 2 minutes
pos,Pos,the half time kids game was more fun to watch
pos,Pos,no fucking way it should be that close with the thunder but fuck it man i m just happy we didn t lose
pos,Pos,paul george is playing hella minutes he s going to be tired real soon just like what happened in the playoffs
pos,Neg,if this team doesn t figure out their offense soon we re not making the play in win s better than a loss though hopefully they can build off of it and develop some momentum
neg,Pos,i feel like mann is still being kinda passive love that luke is more aggressive this season though he came up big loved sga when he was here glad to see him ballin out and getting paid giddey looks good too
pos,Pos,fun game the tank rolls on
neg,Neg,tank commander bazley
pos,Pos,man the clippers offence outside of pg is rough
pos,Pos,gotta say it when the clippers get the w i get a little chubby dude
pos,Pos,we suck okc just sucked a little more than us down the stretch this group has no offensive game plan other than to chuck threes and hope that pg can keep it up as a one man team yes the win is something we absolutely needed but i don t like this team at all neither good nor entertaining minus pg s late game heroics tonight
pos,Pos,another great game from us we lost to paul george not the clippers we led for most of the game as arguably the worst team in the league with no dort shai put on a fantastic display of shotmaking in the 3rd and giddey completely controlled the 4th quarter for us hit several self created shots including a mid range pullup over pg and a take to the basket on pg he s so poised and mature for a 19 year old cut bazley though please love to see it
pos,Pos,mike muscala to sam presti after the game i know what you want i got this
pos,Pos,these close games aren t good for my heart
neg,Pos,leaving greatness aside is pg13 worthy of all nba selection over lebron this season
pos,Pos,baze and a 2nd for bagley who says no
pos,Pos,happiest man watching the comeback sam presti
neg,Pos,prest must ve called bazley in those final minutes
pos,Pos,bazley is not the dumbest player in the league but he may be the most frustrating one to watch
pos,Pos,i think everyone expected too much out of t mann after the playoffs
pos,Pos,can clips at least get the 4th seed so i can see an mvpg redemption at the end of the season
pos,Pos,bazley is really disrespectful with his 4th quarter performance tonight smh
neg,Neg,we win that game if dort plays
neg,Neg,i was ready to say both la teams were rattled by a bunch of kids but bazely came in clutch to not let that happen
pos,Pos,pg really needs some damn help
neg,Pos,went to this game and my main observations are that the thunder are going to be very fun and good in a couple years and i wish paul george had signed with the lakers a few years ago question for the thunder fans is the idea for sga to be the point of the future or is there room for someone else to do that on the team and slide him to the 2
neg,Neg,where was dort
pos,Pos,why did we not play poku more in the second half
pos,Pos,okc an adamant follower of carlisle school of tank nice
pos,Pos,bazley might be the worst nba player of all time
pos,Pos,chokelahoma city
neg,Pos,wooooo go clips
pos,Pos,give pg some help
neg,Pos,bazley and maledon might be the 2 worst rotational players in the entire nba
pos,Pos,pg with the biggest carry job ever
pos,Pos,thanasis went 9 8 with 2 steals on 4 4 shooting that is how this game went
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,when did giannis play on a g league team just kidding but it was giannis and 4 bench players as starters
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i feel like the pistons weren t even running actual offensive sets they looked lost the whole game out there
neg,Pos,thanasis is an nba player
pos,Pos,giannis 3 7 3ptm 7 7 ft book it
pos,Pos,thanks pistons for the much needed w you dudes are great hope y all get rewarded with chet holmgren or banchero which ever y all prefer
pos,Pos,life is pain
pos,Pos,is it time to get worried about cade edit can t believe i gotta put a s on this
pos,Pos,giannis and 4 fans could sweep the central division
neg,Pos,this is a normal ass game for giannis lmao
pos,Neg,giannis gets more done in 27 minutes than i do in an 8 hour work day
neg,Neg,just a reminder that it took like 5 nba games for jamal murray to finally hit a jumpshot
pos,Neg,why are they not running the offense through cade
neg,Pos,sad szn
pos,Pos,why doesn t kelly o start i feel like it would space the floor out much better
pos,Pos,hope cade can put it together city of detroit needs it
pos,Pos,pistons may never win in milwaukee until 2024
pos,Pos,i am here to overreact again bust
pos,Pos,donovan mitchell started his first five games shooting 25 from 2 and 17 from 3 i hope cade realizes his slow start isn t something to beat himself up on because he seems like a chill dude
pos,Pos,pat leading the giannis with over a point a minute and perfect from the line gotta love it
pos,Pos,cade s shot is broke
neg,Pos,500 baby i like the pistons much better without blake now beating them 15 times in a row seems almost a bit mean maybe get yourself one later in the season pistons
neg,Pos,anyone else thinking cade might be a bust
pos,Pos,don t even give detroit a 1st pick again
pos,Neg,hmmm maybe the pistons won t hit the over for wins this season
pos,Pos,the heat are stacked this year
pos,Pos,miami fans i hope you realize now why we put lowry on such a pedestal and constantly argue for his case as one of the best pgs and leaders in the game he really is special and he s gonna be a big help in getting you guys deep in the playoffs
pos,Pos,how is your team defense coming together so quickly honestly we re not gonna be happy with 110 damn that s sexy to be able to afford that kind of standards
neg,Neg,we look fucking legit
neg,Neg,the heat fucked around and upgraded to a big four a real title contender barring injuries for the mavs i know kp is out but him playing doesn t fix their issues luka needs some help
pos,Pos,i m getting the pots and pans ready
pos,Neg,this heat team is scary
pos,Pos,kyle lowryyyy
pos,Pos,i honestly don t see any reason why this heat team can t make it to the finals this year ridiculously talented and have a good amount of scoring options to go to
neg,Neg,kyle lowry ain t no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
neg,Neg,congratulations to the dallas mavericks for being the second team to score 100 points against the miami heat in regulation
neg,Pos,we want bama
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,kyle post game interview stating we won t be happy giving up 110
pos,Pos,6 turnovers am i dreaming
pos,Pos,los heat son los mejores
pos,Pos,i love big butts and i cannot lie
pos,Pos,we may never shoot below 50 from 3 again
pos,Pos,kyle lowry
pos,Pos,the dolphins sacrificed their season so the heat can have this season good trade
pos,Pos,eastern is so stacked this year i m fucking buzzing for heat v bulls
pos,Pos,jimmy butler said fuck your new foul rules
pos,Pos,this team looks like they ve been all playing together for years and years exciting times just need to keep it going
pos,Pos,lol we won by 15 and our point differential actually went down
neg,Neg,did somebody say culture
pos,Pos,i m not trying to overreact but i legitimately think we look like a 60 win team we re blowing teams out and it s not even close our offense hasn t relied on hot shooting and our defense isn t just momentarily looking good because of wonky opponent 3 point shooting our rotations are on point bam has been a monster as a help defender as usual and dedmon s been our go to weapon if we re trying to play drop coverage also kyle lowry has been a blessing he s in the jimmy butler tier of rarified air as an on the fly decision maker
pos,Pos,love this team
pos,Pos,the heat are coming out the east and have a very good chance of winning it all i am calling it now it obviously depends on a lot of things like if herro is still gonna continue shooting like white ray allen but yeah they are strong as shit
neg,Neg,i m gonna be real i didn t think we d be this good i don t think i knew how much kyle lowery meant toward winning games sometimes there are dude s whose numbers don t accurately portray their importance i also didn t know what to expect of our second unit with markieff dedmon strus and martin getting big minutes they really gel though that second unit lowery helping in such a huge way pj adding so much defensively and herro s giant step forward have really got us going all that and bam and jimmy s continued consistency craziness
neg,Neg,everyone owes herro an apology my god is he good
pos,Neg,lowry s best game with us by a country mile those dagger 3 s in the 4th were nuts his presence has also let bam feast on the boards this season which has been awesome to watch
pos,Pos,that boy tyler herro a bucket
neg,Neg,tyler herro
pos,Neg,the heats defense is absolutely insane one of the most fun teams to watch on both ends played pretty amazing basketball today personally i really don t understand the mavs offense when luka doesn t have the ball brunson was amazing but besides that they were pretty bad the roster surrounding doncic is really disappointing
neg,Pos,kyle lowry
neg,Neg,remember victor oladipo is on this team
pos,Pos,we gotta stop giving haslem these thibodeau minutes we re gonna run this man ragged lol
neg,Neg,if oladipo even comes back and plays his typical elite defense then good luck league
pos,Pos,fucking brunson jesus christ this would have been a 30 point game if he didn t keep them afloat
pos,Pos,tyler 6moty campaign continues
neg,Pos,if heat stays healthy they are definitely winning it all i don t see any team that can beat them in a best of 7
neg,Neg,heatwin 50 papa johns bitch
neg,Neg,hey that s fun seeing ud in the game
pos,Pos,herro for mip thats all i m gonna say
pos,Neg,please someone save doncic also tyler herro is actually fucking amazing lol
neg,Neg,and people used to clown us for saying lowry was a top pg in the nba
pos,Pos,tough defences like miami will defend luka pounding the air out the ball for 20 seconds blindfolded brunson s got to touch the ball in fourth before its a 20 point blowout with two mins left he adds such a spark to the dallas offence
neg,Pos,where the herro haters at
neg,Pos,just give miami the ring now
pos,Pos,dallas should feel good about themselves this is the most points miami has given up all year
pos,Pos,i dont know what to think about this season this team needs some fresh faces starting the same 5 players for three years just doesnt work i can see the ad situation in dallas if the front office doesnt wake up
pos,Neg,the pj addition is huge for miami
pos,Pos,living in a timeline where lowry and demar might finally start getting some respect from the casual fans
pos,Pos,the fact the mavs even score 100 in a game is amazing their offense is absoulte dog shit it s literally just stand around and watch luka
neg,Neg,four players with 20 points culture
pos,Pos,our weakest game on rebounds in a hot minute
pos,Pos,those heat chants made my season
pos,Neg,so basically dallas offense is just hope for luka magic
neg,Pos,it s early but i don t remember feeling this good about our team in a very long time
pos,Pos,miami will easily win the finals if they stay healthy they have essentially 4 allstar caliber players in butler bam lowry and herro but what makes them especially deadly is that all of their stars complement each other and make each other better reminiscent of curry klay and kd all playing well off each other
pos,Pos,let this be a lesson to future contenders when you have a chance to win maybe pull the trigger on an ultimate impact player like lowry
pos,Pos,udonis is the goatttt seriously tho i actually love this guy even if he isn t that good at basketball at this point
neg,Pos,in terms of offensive sets we have no offensive sets
neg,Pos,jimvp campaign continues
neg,Pos,bam dpoy campaign commencing
pos,Pos,despite the win and box score this felt like our weakest game since the pacers we didn t dominate the boards like we ve been doing and lots of easy layups were missed luka s gravity also created too many offensive opportunities think bam s knee must not have been at 100 because his unassisted offense was off
pos,Pos,everyone rightfully talking about lowry but pj tucker is the other huge addition defensively the team and their chemistry are scary good
neg,Neg,inject those let s go heat chants into my cafecitooooooo
pos,Pos,heat good at basketball there i said it
pos,Pos,if people are still doubting this heat team they are either insane or simply ignorant they got jimmy g buckets in his natural role paired up with the best floor general in the conference yes better than james harden with the d anchored by bam and a decent supporting cast don t be surprised if they win 60 games
pos,Pos,fuck all the idiots in this sub who called them bubble frauds
pos,Pos,being a mavs fan is miserable
neg,Neg,your 2022 nba champions belongs to the miami heat
pos,Neg,y all talked a lottta shit this offseason a lottttaaa shit oh and btw oladipo getting healthy in the shadows
pos,Pos,mavs fans were trying to chant fuck dwade at the end but all that came out was lets go heat
neg,Neg,spot up lowry shows up and everybody packs up
neg,Pos,tyler herro will be a all star
pos,Pos,who will introduce herro in the hof
pos,Pos,herro will eventually be starting for the heat he s 21 got so many years to develop who says he has to get the keys to the franchise right out the gate really like what miami is doing developing him into the player they ll need on the team s schedule and maybe down the road he ll be the centerpiece of the heat like luka or trae talent wise he s their peer but dallas and atl need those two as the primary engine of the team miami doesn t which is a luxury and a credit to a great organization
neg,Neg,kyle lowry ain t no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like hes some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time hes not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
pos,Pos,kyle playing less than 10 games as part of the heat has already elevated his status as one of the greatest modern nba players
neg,Neg,lowry buckets hit different idk why
pos,Pos,we might be good
pos,Pos,absolutely beautiful game the mavericks definitely pushed us to our offensive limits a 46 point quarter and a tough win even though we had a slow start tough games like that are the best since they hopefully prepare you for the playoffs onto the next one gotta take it one game at a time every team in this league wants the win
pos,Pos,gotta love those heat chants let s go heat
neg,Neg,rough game to watch but we hung in there with a team much better than ours with arguably our third best player out you know maxi
pos,Pos,aight i m going to pray to my maxi kleber shrine so his back can be fixed quicker
pos,Neg,more like kyle wowry amirite
pos,Neg,kyle lowry was a toronto raptor cries myself to sleep
neg,Neg,lowry is so good best pg in the east
pos,Pos,tbh i thought the mavs played pretty well for missing their top two bigs they were never going to win but it was somewhat interesting until miami clamped it down in the 4th
neg,Neg,tyler herro is too good man
pos,Pos,we re winning it all
pos,Pos,the kyle lowry effect take good care of him heat fans
pos,Pos,not bad for some bubble frauds
neg,Pos,dude jimmy fucking buckets man
pos,Pos,man every game makes me more angry at the position we are in it is so difficult to play the injured card because we expect porzingis to be injured than playing brunson passing kp all time scoring for the mavs says a lot about kps availability
pos,Pos,the difference in talent between the 2 team is insane
pos,Pos,mavs are ass and should prepare for another first round exit
pos,Pos,i m in love with a man and his name is kyle lowry
neg,Neg,nice home win by miami was worried in the first quarter ngl
pos,Pos,how s everyone struggling to get free throws and butler getting 15 gg heat look legit
neg,Pos,is tyler herro in the same conversation as luka and trae
neg,Pos,dallas couldn t miss in the first quarter and still shot well in the second and miami still won by 15 and emptied the bench down the stretch in the 4th
pos,Pos,ignore my flair bias but kyle lowry is a god he should have made like 5 all defense teams but he never did because he never campaigned for it kyle lowry willed us into having the second best record in the league after a superstar level player walked away for free and almost single handedly beat a good celtics team despite pascal selling kyle lowry was the 2nd best player on a championship winning groat
neg,Neg,one thing i learned from this game is that luka is our best big man
pos,Pos,is it time to be worried about the mavericks
neg,Pos,6 months ago everyone was shitting on us for holding out during the trade deadline now yall understand the impact lowry has on a basketball team we ve been preaching for years
neg,Pos,this may be a bit of an overreaction but i m pretty sure now that we have lowry we d sweep a superteam of 95 96 bulls and 15 16 warriors pretty easily
neg,Neg,will be such a thing this year and it will be the most annoying thing ever for everyone else god bless all of us
pos,Pos,they got luka surrounded by bums jason kidd included
neg,Neg,ud sighting herro 6moty campaign continues and we got a bam double double this team is spooky scary and i love it
pos,Pos,front offices better start making long term plans for doncic
pos,Pos,the mavs play some of the ugliest basketball i ve seen that shit looked like pickup ball
pos,Neg,this heat team is scary as hell
neg,Neg,welp there s the beatdown chuck was looking for
pos,Pos,besides kyle lowry damn if herro isn t backing his i m trae and luka and ja level shit up i mean obviously not to that degree but he s playing well
pos,Neg,miami vs bulls ecfs
neg,Neg,heat are top 2 in the east solid solid team mavs looked better this game hopefully we just keep getting better
pos,Pos,this loss wasn t as bad as i thought it would be
pos,Pos,mavs front office gotta be the worst in the league
neg,Neg,this team is doomed thanks kp thanks cuban tanking would ve the best thing we could do this season but we re obviously not going to do it roster is not nearly good enough and we can t do nothing to improve it
pos,Pos,best heat team since 2012 2013 it s beautiful to see we have a legit superteam
pos,Pos,the heat got literally all of the most heat culture guys in the off season
pos,Pos,i love this team
pos,Pos,top 2 not 2
pos,Pos,lets go heat
neg,Neg,heat bulls on nov 27 get ready for sparks
neg,Pos,i m so exited to watch this team the rest of the year lfg
pos,Pos,este jaime mayordomo quiere ser el jmv como dijo jaime mayordomo la tenés adentro luka
pos,Pos,that s great and all but why is there a pic of lebron
neg,Neg,heat and bulls to take over reg season calling it now
pos,Pos,that was such a hard game to watch we couldn t get anything to drop in the second half but it really looked like we were going to hang in the first it s so frustrating that kp was out again with never coming back soreness how are we ever supposed to get into a rhythm with him if he never plays especially a big team defining game like this i feel like the only reason we built him up at the beginning of the year was for smoke and mirrors trade bait heat used a great double team strategy on luka because the rest of the team is having a hard time getting good shots to go in heat look legit four players over 20 points y all have a fun season ahead of you also i always love seeing marcus morris dude does honest work
neg,Neg,man if the heat play the bulls in the playoffs we all win and that s not even counting the nets and bucks there s good odds that some variation of those matchups happen and then the ecf is some other variation of those teams eastern playoffs are going to be amazing to watch this year and then if philly can find a way to make joel embiid last through the whole season we get to watch him play one of these teams too eastern playoffs are gonna be something special this year because i think realistically all series in the 2nd round and the ecf can go to 7 ______ i haven t been this hyped for the eastern playoffs in a very very long time
pos,Neg,this game made me sad
pos,Pos,clutch shooting by the jazz at the end to miss 3 straight free throws so that sacramento covered
pos,Neg,whiteside with the 12 rebounds in 15 minutes to have a guy who can backup rudy like that is amazing
pos,Pos,utah has a pretty good squad
neg,Pos,fuck the astros
pos,Pos,why the old thread deleted anyway fox is really bad rn imagine the old fox on this team we d be like 5 2 rn
pos,Pos,what s with all these randomly deleted post game threads this season feels like it s happening way more than the past
pos,Pos,utah jazz all stars tonight donovan mitchell 36 pts 5 12 3s 8 rbd 6 ast mike conley 30 pts 6 9 3s 3 rbd 2 ast rudy gobert 12 pts 20 rbd 4 blk
pos,Neg,don t let the box score fool you the game was hella close
pos,Pos,rudy fucking gobert donovan fucking mitchell mike fucking conley
pos,Pos,well fought kings barnes is a demon
pos,Pos,bruh how are the kings so close at the end of every game but don t know shit about closing out
pos,Pos,that got intense even those last meaningless free throws this kings team is no joke and they are going to smash some teams unexpectedly this year
neg,Neg,i feel sorry for the team that cops jordan clarksons return
pos,Pos,conley mitchell and gobert did there shit but once again i am super hyped for whiteside he s been such a good pickup
neg,Pos,i love rudy gobert
neg,Neg,48 minutes of rudy gobert and hassan whiteside must seem like hell to opposing teams so many guards just nope ing out of drives this season
pos,Pos,refs got bored at the 4th and said let s take this great physical game and make it fuckin shitty and boring as hell
neg,Neg,why d the other thread get deleted that was a messy game
pos,Pos,rudy s been going to the line a lot this season
pos,Neg,gobert with the casual 20 reb
neg,Pos,any idea why the last one was removed was one of the team records wrong
pos,Pos,clarkson doo doo today role players meh sans whiteside all stars very good
pos,Pos,why did buddy get tossed i was watching the kings feed and they had no idea it was even happening
pos,Pos,fox has been cheeks how many games before we hit the panic button
neg,Neg,hassan is fkn hilarious
pos,Pos,i love having 3 all stars
pos,Pos,another game we let slip cause fox played like shit please snap out of this slump you re actually hurting us holmes was playing on one leg and will probably miss the next game
pos,Pos,mitchell shooting 30 times isn t ideal but i ll take it
neg,Pos,refball
pos,Pos,well that was a steamy hot ref fest sorry sacramento what a shit ending
pos,Pos,rudy gobeast goboards goclutch gowashboardabs
pos,Neg,how did davion play
pos,Pos,that 4th was a fucking slog to watch nba officiating about to give me a hernia one of these days
neg,Pos,kings should put mitchell in the starting lineup and bring hali off the bench to run offense for the second unit
pos,Pos,harrison barnes resurgence
pos,Pos,rebound bros
neg,Neg,sac bros are you worried about fox body language seems like his intensity is off
pos,Pos,harrison barnes is an all star fight me
neg,Neg,is bagley still hurt
pos,Neg,it s gotta be killing butler to see his old teammate getting those minutes
pos,Pos,jazz fans are 60 white dudes in backwards baseball caps
pos,Pos,can someone beat the jazz please i want the warriors to have the seed
neg,Pos,somebody should really check on that lady who was screaming bloody murder all 48 minutes
neg,Neg,new orleans was the better team then they werent i dont understand
neg,Neg,suns 11 5 never in doubt
pos,Pos,booker truly has chronic durant foot syndrome has never missed a foot on the line 2
pos,Neg,hard for the pelicans to win when our superstar herb jones can t play
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,what are the suns this year that first half was just awful double digit win i ll take it but i will be confused about it
neg,Pos,christ paul coming through with taking the game over to a lead and devin foot on the line book with them clutch shots to seal a much needed w
neg,Neg,the cp3 show ft javale mcgee and frank kaminsky
pos,Pos,i m heartbroken we looked so good to start even missing bi and zion and now we re 1 7 despite multiple great efforts and now i have to sift through 100 nephew posts about david griffin being awful pelicans needing to be relocated or zion demanding out i m exhausted when jameis tore his acl sunday i wasn t even upset because i thought well that s nothing compared to being a pelicans fan
pos,Pos,man herb jones got hurt
neg,Pos,chris paul is so fucking good
pos,Pos,i got one word for you paul must see tv
pos,Pos,cp3 bridges mcgee and frank all balled out today everyone else tried their hardest to sabotage the game till the 4th quarter
pos,Pos,even making the comeback and getting the win the team this year has major problems with effort that have been apparent across the whole start of the season the first three quarters of this game were an absolute trainwreck and it was because we were being lazy and weren t playing with any sense of urgency against a better team we never make this comeback hell against this same team we don t make this comeback if they have their two best players back i m happy for the win though we needed it ugly or not and give frank the goddamn game ball he was the only one out there trying to get something going in the first half and he played his ass off i don t care if cp3 jumped two spots on the assist leaderboards or that he had eighteen assists this game frank got us back into it
pos,Pos,i wasn t even remotely worried
neg,Neg,jv is beasting out there
neg,Neg,booker waited until he knew herb jones wasn t coming back to play
pos,Pos,we were down 20 in the 2nd and i thought we d get blown out great 4th q
pos,Pos,i m actually not entirely heartbroken i would be if herb played the whole game but once he got out i just knew chris and booker were gonna start hitting shots we needed him bad
pos,Pos,that s the real chris paul
pos,Pos,a very sloppy game but entertaining nonetheless vintage cp3 and javal mcgee and frank the tank were so fun to watch
neg,Pos,cp3 and book completely took over the game in the fourth
neg,Pos,no herb jones no fun
neg,Neg,new orleans just doesn t have enough most teams don t when down their two best scorers and their best defender
pos,Neg,i fucking hate injuries
pos,Pos,mcgee chris paul and jaxson hayes were amazing for the suns
neg,Neg,trade naw
pos,Pos,cp3 was on a mission to get that all time assists record today
pos,Pos,damn jalen smith got no playing time tonight
neg,Neg,i can t take it anymore someone send help
pos,Pos,people were saying kyle lowry can do everything cp3 can nowadays lmaoooo
pos,Pos,i never thought i d say this but god damn nola give jonas some help
neg,Pos,that s my point god
pos,Pos,shoutout to the refs for calling every and 1 imaginable of the suns but missing an obvious slap on the wrist in a crucial part of the game this game should be shown to any person who questions willie for starting herb jones have no idea how he lasted until the second round we have no consistent playmaker to work with down the stretch without zion and bi and it showed in this game
pos,Pos,we covered the spread nothing to see here people
pos,Pos,there s no reason for zion to return this season nola should roll out the tanks
neg,Neg,no is done bring on the tank
pos,Pos,see you next season pelicans
pos,Pos,cp3 took that shit
pos,Pos,3 79 here we come
pos,Neg,we are so bad that the league should take away our win
pos,Pos,what the hell were the pelicans doing on defense blitzing chris paul does nothing for you
pos,Pos,i still never could get why the pelicans let ball go really weird one
pos,Pos,that 1 quarter was embarassing this team is great when they give a damn
pos,Pos,never ever seen 2 points taken away that late after a ref fuck up fucking crazy
pos,Pos,2 points isn t 2 points it s a lie 2 points is not 2 points i ll explain it to you right now nba referees
pos,Pos,only thing higher than me right now might be the arc on jalen greens shot
pos,Pos,refs point shaving jalen going tmac this game was wild in the clutch
pos,Pos,bruh this team is killing me we are atrocious defensively
pos,Pos,ok sure they shouldn t have shot free throws but then taking away 2 points assumes they would not have scored on that possession that would have occurred instead of free throws so bs
pos,Pos,legit the strangest end to a game i ve ever seen
neg,Neg,literally those two points almost made the difference what the fuck refs
neg,Pos,i have never seen points retroactively taken away from free throws multiple plays later off the top of my head that s a first
pos,Pos,carmelo anthony is a game changer for the lakers he is the 4th best player and the best shooter for the lakers all for a vet min contract
pos,Pos,mad respect to those young rockets lebron ad and russ all had big nights and they pushed them all the way to the brink
pos,Pos,lakers making victories tougher than they need to be lmao they now have the opposite problem their offense is fine but their defense is ass doesn t matter what team they re facing you re gonna be struggling against any team if u basically give them open shots constantly or handicap yourself by playing dj lol with that said despite their ugly ws their chemistry is looking better and a dub is a dub
pos,Pos,jalen green is special
pos,Neg,really impressed with russ s fit on this team and his improvement so far this season
pos,Pos,i keep saying jalen best player in the draft
pos,Pos,that was a shitshow
neg,Pos,westbrook is not an issue on this team at all letting the rockets score 70 in one half is a no go though
pos,Neg,i thought they were gonna make that 3 after that fiasco of a fourth quarter
pos,Pos,you can see the rockets really wanted this one i feel for them
neg,Neg,can the lakers please have a game where my heart isn t beating out of my chest in the 4th quarter please lmao
pos,Pos,damn so close green aka goat
pos,Pos,41 free throw shooting
pos,Pos,that jalen green 3 at the end of the game was a sick shot
pos,Pos,jalen green is a fucking monster
pos,Pos,why is westbrook half naked on the court lmao
neg,Neg,lakers may have won the game but kevin porter really showed russ who s the early season turnover king of the league
neg,Neg,is bron back up over 27 0 ppg
pos,Pos,lebron you never cease to amaze me unreal
pos,Pos,lakers should have kept morris just for the defense instead of adding ariza
pos,Pos,good game rocket bros jalen is a bad mofo great bounce back game for him
pos,Neg,lol weird ass game but it was great to see lebron show he can still take over games at will ill take the win lets go lakers
pos,Pos,jalen green should ve taken the last shot not kpj especially when jalen just hit back to back 3s
pos,Pos,are we sure this is the final score the refs might still review and deduct 3 points from the lakers smh
pos,Pos,road to champions 79 3
neg,Neg,wait i m watching a stream right now fuck i got spoiled lmao
pos,Pos,really wanted that w jalen green is something special man
pos,Pos,refs almost lost us the game
pos,Pos,sick 3 by jalen though be cool if he finally starts getting more efficient scoring though
pos,Pos,if we lost off of that fuck up by the refs i woulda been pissed lmao
neg,Neg,no matter what happens to green i will always remember those 2 shots that was bonkers
pos,Pos,not a great sign to struggle to put away the rockets but wins are wins so i ll take it
pos,Pos,my pp went hard and flaccid and hard
pos,Pos,good try refs almost got us this time
pos,Pos,when there was 40 seconds left i was like ahhh hopefully they won t fuck it up back to back threes by green
pos,Pos,lakers have won 5 of their last 6 and the loss was a historic collapse where lebron wasn t playing i don t get it why does this sub act like they suck
pos,Pos,well can t say i ve ever seen that before
pos,Pos,i was hoping that rockets win just to see how the nba would handle taking away those 2 free throws even though baze should have shot free throws they would at least get the possession back
pos,Pos,i turned 32 today must be a sign
pos,Pos,probably not a good sign that they got lit up by one of the worst teams in the league and one of the worst offenses
pos,Neg,c wood would have been great in detroit or anywhere for that matter pistons were dumb to let him go for cheap
pos,Pos,gee i guess being a referee really is rocket science
neg,Pos,say what you want about lakers basketball its hella entertaining
pos,Neg,refs time travelled to take off 2 points but didn t get back the the correct timeline smh
pos,Pos,rockets had one of those shooting nights but the lakers matched it take 5 rotation players out of the lineup and lets see that teams record
pos,Pos,anthony marshon davis jr lebron goat james russ making his freethrows
neg,Pos,i almost had a fucking heartattack
pos,Pos,lakers got lucky this time
neg,Neg,lakers playing matador defense and struggling against tanking teams smh
neg,Neg,a win is a win
neg,Pos,shoutout to lebron james good god
pos,Pos,we desperately need tucker and ariza back if ariza can t go we need another wing our defense just cannot matchup whenever baze gets in foul trouble which is often
pos,Pos,russ and lebron fit great offensively they especially lebron are basketball geniuses our problem from the start was defense losing our great defenders really hurt us hopefully once we get healthy and dj doesn t play anymore we look better defensively
pos,Pos,lakers fans bitching about the refs in a pointless regular season game when they constantly get the benefit of the doubt in games that actually matter
pos,Pos,jalen green roty
neg,Neg,lakers kinda suck considering the talent they have on their roster
neg,Neg,this lakers defense is going to get torn to shreds in the playoffs if they keep it up like this
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,rockets got some damn shooters
pos,Neg,damn the rockets are really bad
pos,Pos,lebron and ad playing 32 mins to win by 2 against this rockets team i would rather just have us go for a lottery pick wtf was the point of signing westbrook we do worse with him on the floor than any other pg
neg,Pos,the lakers barely beat us hahahahhaha
pos,Pos,fact that they have three starters with 20 plus and they still barely won is a terrible sign for the laker
pos,Neg,westbrook looks so much better when he is going to the rim rather than shooting staggering him and lebron definitely doing work
pos,Pos,man this lakers team still isn t good lots of things to change or adjust before the playoffs
pos,Pos,i can t name any starting five on rockets and lakers still found a way to struggle that really bodes well p s i apologize to all rockets fans for my ignorance
neg,Neg,kent bazemore fucking sucks
pos,Neg,damn lebron ad and westbrook shooting about average for a 2 point win against the rockets big yikes
neg,Pos,that was honestly one of the most dramatic fourth quarters i have seen regular season
pos,Pos,isn t the last possession a back court violation or no
pos,Pos,that was a nice ending
neg,Pos,this is going to be another roller coaster season for the lakers huh kudos to the rockets for not giving up
neg,Neg,an ugly win but still a win
pos,Pos,lebron
pos,Pos,i thought i was tripping when i saw the score go from 116 to 114 for the lakers turns out my eyes were correct what an odd call also that defense is beyond ugly to watch vogel and the players got their work cut out for them
neg,Pos,lakers defense has been surprisingly bad so far ad looks a step slow on defense too
neg,Pos,lakers big 3 looked good lebron put the team on his back in the 4th and jalen is a cold mfer gotta give props to the refs defense on la literally erasing 2 points from the lakers
pos,Neg,refs should take two more points away
neg,Neg,refs forgot the pt spread they bet on simple miscalculation guys nothing to worry about
neg,Neg,lmao lebron dropped fit out in his post game interview but in a positive way taking about how players in a new situation always try to fit in but when you re a special player like russ you should fit out basically saying he wants russ to be himself
pos,Pos,that was close damn these young teams are really giving the lakers some problems
neg,Neg,what the hell happen to lakers defense
pos,Pos,the final inbound was bad they inbounded into back court and it pretty much ran down the entire clock and they couldnt get a quality look at any shot
pos,Pos,wood is 26 but the ret of those young 2 3 are ysuper young wow hou actually has a future i thought it was terrible to let wall not play since youknow he is getting nothing but 100 m but eh development and long term should bode well in 3 years assuming wood develops more they should be a dynamic trio
pos,Pos,what happened to the lebron russ pnr
pos,Neg,that whole fourth quarter was a mess everywhere jalen green was clutch though
neg,Neg,too close for comfort lakers d need to really improve those 2 pts though jesus
pos,Pos,why didn t westbrook try the josh smith experience i think álvaro martín an nba analyst commentator from espn and leaguepass latinamerica said that a coach or something like that told josh smith don t shoot 3s this year and you will have a great year 2009 2010 and it was an amazing year in terms of efficiency etc after that year josh went fuck you and started shooting 3s off course check his advanced stats and it s amazing in offensive and defensive winshares winshares ws 48 offensive defensive box plusminus box plusminus valueoverreplacement fg efg apg spg in per ts and 2pt rpg
neg,Pos,weird quarter scores by the lakers 32 32 23 32
pos,Pos,thoughts on malik monk so far
pos,Pos,rockets have talented young core
pos,Pos,is garuba injured i thought he d have some minutes
pos,Pos,i was at this game and it was so frustrating glad we got the w the fans love melo i saw my lakers again for the first time since 2020 of jan and i got my dwight 39 jersey but they need to work on that defense it s reminding me of the cavs when they had d rose and d wade
pos,Pos,dawned on me that the lakers have 4 ex rockets on their team melo russ dwight and ariza
neg,Pos,blowout
pos,Neg,this is one of those games that stats don t show everything lakers look a lot better on paper than what they executed on the floor poor boxing out miscommunications on defensive duties allowing the rockets to get to the restricted area way easier than they should have lebron with the usual no effort for 3 quarters etc lakers had 60 fg in the first half and were still down 6 because of their atrocious defense it s why the scoreline is a lot closer than it should have been ad was basically chilling ball watching at the three point line for most of the second half on offensive possessions only took 5 total shots in the paint in the 3rd and 4th quarter he looked like he didn t want to bang in the paint and hardly tried to contest jump for any 50 50 balls because he was scared he was gonna get injured westbrook had some ill advised prayer drives to the basket in the 4th 0 4 attempts i believe with a few bail out ft trips because his teammates were just ball watching you can t play efficiently or try to play point when your teammates aren t doing jack shit
pos,Neg,what is defense anyways
pos,Neg,with the big 3 going off and great help from melo the lakers should not have had to work this hard for the w this game was essentially their offensive ceiling
neg,Pos,rofl lebron talking about composure and leadership in a 1 possession win against the rockets
pos,Pos,this lakers team is going nowhere that was just atrocious to watch
pos,Pos,that looked close and the green shot previous had filled me with so much hope in spain hold the s
pos,Neg,on one hand that this rockets squad gave the lakers this much trouble does not bode too well for the rest of the season on the other hand though these kind of games and wins will do tremndously for their chemistry and morale there s a reason why they say always win the close ones
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,after all of the drama the lakers are 5 3 and with more soft schedule to come over the next few games
pos,Pos,30min for melo and 37 min for wb peak defense
neg,Neg,this thread is coming like a ghost town
neg,Pos,rubio with the 0 7 11 this guy
pos,Pos,sexland is back baby that mobley block on lillard with a minute left is my favorite cavs moment of the year so far my god
pos,Pos,didn t plan on the cavs having a better season to watch than the browns but here we are
pos,Pos,in conclusion
neg,Neg,ricky rubio leads the team in with 11 off the bench and 0 points
neg,Pos,god damn dame is cold this year also jarrett allen owns your franchise 29 teams included
pos,Pos,fire stotts
neg,Pos,jarrett s first all star appearance is coming soon i can feel it
pos,Pos,cavs are not afraid no matter who they are playing this team is really coming together nicely
pos,Pos,lillard actually switched off cedi for jarrett allen on the last play
pos,Pos,jarrett allen is a top 5 center in this league
pos,Pos,we had absolutely no business winning this one none that bullshit shot selection late in the 4th was unbelievable
neg,Pos,cavs are good
neg,Neg,cavs are the best team in the nba change my mind actually don t do that let me have this
pos,Pos,lillard has been so bad this is by far his best game 37 fg
pos,Pos,that overpaid center had yet another monster game who woulda thought
pos,Pos,at the end of the season someone should make a compilation of guards being excited when they switch onto evan mobley only to be shocked when mobley keeps up with them and blocks their shot at the rim dame was his latest victim and it ll never get old also jarrett allen better be an all star this year
pos,Neg,cavs shot almost 20 less times and won shouldn t work that way portland should feel bad about that
pos,Pos,jarrett allen is an allstar
neg,Neg,dame and cj ain t it larry needs to request a trade to a contending team with a real backcourt duo like garland and sexton
pos,Pos,i love our team
neg,Neg,a watchable team
pos,Pos,jarrett allen going full 2016 kevin love game 7 defense on the last play no hyperbole
pos,Pos,we need to have a serious discussion about dame i don t know if it s an injury tired new system or checked out but hes not playing the same
pos,Neg,in a game in which we shot 53 from the field and 50 from 3 we really tried hard to give this one away 13 second half turnovers nearly cost them the game but jarrett mother fucking allen absolutely stemmed the tide and carried us to the w
pos,Pos,put some respect on the cavs fr
pos,Pos,great win with no love and markenen
pos,Pos,we are the best team in the history of sports
neg,Pos,this team has already mastered the art of false hope
neg,Neg,so dame is off off huh
pos,Pos,78 4 lfg
pos,Neg,ricky rubio with the team high 11 on 0 7 shooting while collin sexton has the team low 11 on 8 12 shooting is really the story of this cavs team lol
pos,Pos,bruh the game over and i m still stressing how dame cj powell would kill us with a 3
pos,Pos,cleveland starting dean wade just beat the starting 5 of the 6 seed in the west last year
neg,Pos,the cavs are back
pos,Neg,you must be this tall to beat the cavs
neg,Neg,this might be a hot take but i think when dame gets his shit together portland will actually be pretty damn good i like their roster this year
pos,Pos,this team gets used to each other and their roles and their spots and cut down to s they ll be around all season
pos,Pos,we run the east baby
pos,Pos,length
pos,Pos,very solid win with three rotation players out wasn t sure we d have the bodies to win tonight
neg,Pos,who s next
pos,Pos,a young team i can root for
neg,Neg,did motherfuckin ricky rubio just go 0 7 for a game best 11
neg,Pos,i m gonna wait at east another 10 games before i make any proclamations but we look pretty good this year definitely much improved from last year and the passing has been much better in the first three quarters we seem to get away from what we did to build big leads in the fourth tho gotta keep moving the ball in the fourth instead of going iso every possession late in the game still a good game and it feels good to actually see improvement from everyone this year don t want to get my hopes up too much tho cuz the cavs had a decent start last year and we all know how that ended up but so far so good
pos,Pos,rubios shot wasn t falling but it he played good team basketball and created shots for others that s a good player right there
pos,Neg,lillard and cj combined for 47 in 46 shots not good at all cavs have been great playing unselfish basketball mobley probably wants to get more looks but he has to understand its all about winning the game not getting 20 or 30 points
neg,Pos,something extremely underrated in this game windler coming in and looking like a pure shooter and gaining confidence you love to see it let s just hope his glass body can hold up for a few weeks this time
pos,Pos,rubio 0 points but 11 is a very rubio stat line
pos,Pos,daryl morey watchin every blazers loss lickin his lips
pos,Pos,jarrett allen is the fucking truth
pos,Pos,cavs gon make da playoffs dis yea ong
pos,Pos,lillard shooting like simmons fair trade imo i got defense on lock
pos,Pos,not been watching blazers but whats up with dame playing injured
neg,Pos,cavs and warriors back and all is right in the world
pos,Pos,something is very wrong with dame seems very injured scared for the league when simons gets his chance to shine boy is fittin to snap i will take a bullet for the cavs
pos,Pos,if jb ever figures out rotations the league is in trouble
pos,Pos,what the hell is portland doing just embrace the tank
pos,Pos,is lillard pulling a harden dude seems checked out
pos,Pos,my blazers suck are you people happy now
pos,Pos,rubio really reminds me of andre miller
pos,Pos,portland is a complete mess they really thought running back a squad that got reamed by austin rivers was a good idea
neg,Neg,don t be fooled by the stat line lillard was terrible
neg,Neg,lame time
pos,Pos,houston we have a problem with dame
pos,Pos,blazers fans let it all out
neg,Pos,i thought dame would heat up after every make and he just stayed cold
pos,Pos,maybe dame time needs daylight savings
pos,Pos,portland looks dejected out there
neg,Neg,dame 10 27 from the field ouch
pos,Pos,that boy tony snell with a classic tony snell game
pos,Neg,is it time to be legitimately concerned about damian lillard
neg,Neg,dame is putting up more fga than points in the majoritybof his games this season
pos,Pos,i know it s never just one play and we need to shoot better but the refs not calling the intentional foul on the fast break and costing the blazers 2 points with 1 minute to go was so brutal those two points would ve helped the blazers a ton
pos,Pos,i get that they won but only going 8 deep on your 7th game of the season does not bode well you need to trust your bench this isn t the playoffs
neg,Neg,dame time more like lame time amiright guys
neg,Neg,just buy out dame so he can join us for the pro rated vet min
pos,Pos,lmao
pos,Pos,life is pain
neg,Pos,the rumour of lillard s demise while not entirely true does have a grain of truth in it
pos,Pos,portland might have to trade dame if he keeps this up good lord reekus
neg,Neg,norm is good
pos,Pos,26 points off 27 shots that does not look good at all
pos,Pos,the ents are going to war the cavs probably
pos,Pos,portland we have a small duo of guards we should get a wing also portland let s trade gary trent jr for a smaller player
pos,Neg,poor poor larry nance
neg,Pos,lillard sucks
neg,Pos,he gone
pos,Pos,pacers are some hot shit when they re down only one starter and tj warren is no longer wearing a boot
pos,Pos,i just woke up from a coma how long has myles turner been considered the greatest shooter of all time
pos,Neg,myles turner is just a bigger better steph curry
pos,Pos,caris being back is huge for us massive upgrade on offense and helps the depth so much
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,the bally sports indiana clock has been like a second behind the actual game clock for like three games now unless i m just crazy it s constantly throwing me off
neg,Pos,the season isn t lost after a 2 game losing streak but randle is really concerning me with his lack of hustle and his terrible body language last season he was priding himself on carrying himself well on the court even mentioning how he was disappointed in his son mimicking his on court behavior but this year you can tell when the defense gets in his head him not hustling and getting back on defense is not okay he was a big part of our offense last season and seems like a lot of those iso fadeaways aren t falling this year i m not concerned too much but he needs to get back into it either that or thibs needs to change our offensive focus i put a lot on randle because he s supposed to be our leader on the court you lead by example and the example he s setting is not one i m liking and does not represent our team mentality
neg,Neg,myles turner is a underrated beast
pos,Neg,east is scary this year can t fall asleep or you might be knocked out of the top 6 real quick
pos,Pos,actually kind of expected us to lose this one pacers are much better than their record they looked great played lights out tonight still disappointing loss that said i love that no matter how bad things look rj never loses his cool or stops hustling he is indisputably the fulcrum of this team and it says a lot that he s the one i automatically look towards to stabilize us when we re falling apart the kid s only 21 but already has the presence and mentality of a seasoned vet he may not be the flashiest player or the most naturally talented but he has it i remain utterly convinced he s going to be something special and will irrationally stan him to the day i die
pos,Pos,i love that god damned pineapple
pos,Pos,fixed the records srry bing bong
pos,Pos,i hate how rj can be playing well and then all of a sudden he s out for 5 10 minutes let him run thibs either way glad we lost this maybe now we d actually start making plans and plays instead of just throwing random mfs out there and hoping for the best
pos,Neg,myles turner finally breaking out this season
pos,Pos,oh no we suck again
pos,Neg,with levert back and warren coming back soon this pacers team is looking scary they re pretty well rounded ngl
neg,Neg,bing bong round 2
pos,Pos,as a rick carlisle truther and miserable mavs fan this pleases me greatly
pos,Pos,i stare at grimes on the bench after every quickley brick
neg,Pos,is it regressing towards the mean if your last mumble mumble years haven t been that great
neg,Pos,knicks got paved
pos,Pos,still don t understand why celtics turned down a trade for miles
pos,Pos,myles turner 7 10 from 3 apparently he hates the knicks as much as i do good game by a guy who is only good in theory
pos,Pos,imagine if the mavs traded for turner instead of kp giving up less draft picks less salary and gaining a much better defender
neg,Neg,bing bong
pos,Pos,bing pacers only missing 1 starter gotta start taking them seriously bong
pos,Pos,myles turner had stepped the hell up for that team
pos,Pos,i can never figure out myles minutes dude was going nuts tonight but he still only played 28m so i thought maybe it was because of fouls or he was turning it over a bunch nope he committed zero fouls and zero turnovers
pos,Neg,god dammit i told bob to go out and get myles
pos,Pos,had levert played 30 plus minutes the pacers could have beat the raps hope he stays healthy if turner could ever become a consistent offensive threat the pacers could be a tough first round match up
pos,Pos,knicks guard defense is terrible
pos,Pos,kembum walker strikes
neg,Neg,it s nice to start getting some players back healthy pacers can be very good with this coaching staff and a healthy team
neg,Pos,pacers were on fire
pos,Pos,i know kemba is older now but lord he as completely dropped off from his last year in charlotte and i think its safe to say boston wasn t the problem
pos,Neg,bing bong
pos,Neg,bing bong
pos,Pos,kemba had a nice 2 games didn t he
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,no bing bong tonight babe
pos,Pos,man when randle is having a bad night he s having a really bad night
neg,Neg,washed kemba is back
pos,Pos,we re back to the joke of the league spot unreal only the knicks can waste their best roster in close to a decade
neg,Pos,wwhhhyyyy pelinka turner had been on the block forever all you had to do was send tht and a pick for the perfect 5 for this team
pos,Pos,is tatum shooting with his eyes closed this season
pos,Pos,tatum and dame are first team all yips this season
neg,Neg,insane that we re so bad when horford and jaylen are playing out of their minds
neg,Pos,not our best showing but thankfully the magic were magnanimous enough to roll over for us in the third quarter
pos,Pos,al horford must just actually fucking hate the city of philadelphia
pos,Pos,i llll take it
pos,Pos,thank you jaylen very cool
pos,Pos,the boston celtics have won a game
pos,Pos,played defense for once tatum still can t hit a shot doesn t matter if we can t do it against teams that don t suck
pos,Pos,first half all right let s stay competitive second half oh we tankin tankin
pos,Pos,lmao who tf tatum n brown supposed to pass to
neg,Neg,i thought the celtics were supposed to lose forever
pos,Pos,orlando scored 33 points and yet the worst thing i saw on the court was during halftime hecking contortionist guy
pos,Pos,worth noting tatum officially passed rajon rondo for 25th all time on boston s scoring list i always forget just how long rondo balled for boston
pos,Pos,maybe they should hold players only meetings before each game
pos,Pos,ugly win i ll take it needed more al pp nesmith minutes
neg,Pos,celtics during 4th quarter against the bulls magic during 3rd quarter against the celtics
pos,Pos,i checked the schedule and said if we lost this one it s defcon5 for us
pos,Pos,fun fact jayson tatum has yet to attempt an uneven number of field goals this season current attempts by game 30 14 24 28 22 32 22 16
neg,Neg,tatum woke up feeling ice cold 14 points 25 from the field 17 from deep 1 irreparably broken locker room
neg,Neg,brown tatum
neg,Neg,players only meeting paying early dividends
neg,Pos,fresh off the back of a players only meeting and comments by marcus smart about passing tatum s assists drop from 10 to 3 lol
pos,Pos,so this is what a win feels like
pos,Pos,a win is a win i guess but that really sucked
neg,Pos,after monday we needed this
pos,Pos,that s unfortunate
pos,Neg,must really suck for sixers fans to watch horford dominate
neg,Pos,i would love to listen to kyrie s conspiracy as to why both brown and tatum can t both seem to have a good night
neg,Pos,they should have players only meeting before every game and we d go 77 5
pos,Pos,so why isn t the c s coach getting more blame
pos,Neg,this must ve been fun to watch
neg,Neg,who s going to tell tatum that this is jaylens team now
pos,Pos,the magic should get fined for tanking
pos,Pos,i literally came here just to see how many shots tatum and brown took
pos,Pos,apparently the halftime show was something to see anyone got a link
pos,Pos,lmao mo bamba had 1 2 good games everyone was like it s his breakout year and shit he s just ass dude 1 for 6 as a center
pos,Pos,what the hell is going on vuc
pos,Neg,i m loving this new trend of the bulls being terrifying in the fourth quarter even if they don t always win it makes for some fun basketball
pos,Pos,splash brothers 2 0 seth curry and georges niang
pos,Pos,you guys think doc calls seth son after games like this
neg,Pos,derozan turns into mj every fuckin time he plays us
pos,Pos,alright i see you philly aren t going to let any simmons drama drag you outside the top 6 bulls also played a great game looking forward to our first games against each other this year i m excited to face both of you guys also the review by the sixers was smart it was a gamble and they had nothing to lose
neg,Pos,this sixers team is being carried by their amazing role players and that s not something i foresaw going into the season i feel dirty calling seth curry a role player because he means so much to this team but korkmaz thybulle drummond and especially niang have been terrific as well
pos,Neg,ggs 76ers seth with that clutch shot while getting hounded was goated
pos,Pos,4th quarter bulls are absolutely terrifying they just ran out of gas tonight but every last demar doubter has been resoundingly rebuked he was possessed tonight
pos,Pos,i never want to play demar again jesus christ dude is an absolute killer insane play by embiid to get that block thank god doc actually challenged seth curry really fucked around and hit his prime at 31 years old what a beast
pos,Pos,big win for the 76ers bulls are contenders especially when derozan plays possessed like that
pos,Pos,vuc has to do better than 4 points i know he was against embiid but he can t be that much of a non factor
pos,Pos,we gotta start moving the ball on offense way too much dribbling
pos,Pos,what a 3 by zo tho to help bring them within 2
pos,Pos,13 bench points for the bulls sheesh
neg,Pos,when zach gets frustrated he goes into hero ball mode and makes it even worse
pos,Pos,seth curry for josh richardson is an all time trade
pos,Pos,the bulls are never out of it until it s over that s encouraging at least
neg,Pos,missing 3 starters embiid shoots 33 and still get the w
pos,Pos,the better curry
pos,Pos,zach sold i cannot fathom why he s not getting the ball to a red hot demar in the final stretch there
pos,Pos,zach lavine is an amazing athlete and scorer but god damn is his tunnel vision frustrating to watch he watches 3 4 defenders collapse on him going downhill off a screen and almost never passes back to the wide open screener he needs to learn a pick and pop game badly
pos,Pos,the one year the bulls are back to being good the east turns into the motherfucking thunderdome i mean goddamn half of this conference are going to be insanely tough games this season
pos,Pos,gg sixers excited for the rematch
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i believe in niang gang
pos,Pos,embiid did not shoot well at all but holy shit his defense was incredible
pos,Pos,the on court vibes of this team are somehow so awesome niangs energy has gone a long way for tht bench unit maxey with another nice pg game on both ends seth continues to ball and maxey remains a defensive menace fun game gg bulls
pos,Pos,demar literally had the exact same fucking splits he got last time he dropped 37 wtf
pos,Pos,i love how well george niang is thriving in philly
pos,Pos,demar is an all nba player this year edit so far i think this is how it shakes out kd giannis jokic lebron jimmy gobert pg demar embiid you can swap them around but these are the top 9 forwards bigs right now imo
neg,Neg,it makes me so happy to see georges niang growing up
pos,Pos,the tisse and tyrese backcourt is filthy
neg,Pos,matisse may not score the most points but damn he is just different defensively
pos,Pos,josh richardson for seth curry who says no
pos,Pos,the difference in lavine and demar down the stretch is night and day lavine has to realize it s not his night and he has another elite scorer to take the pressure he was doing way too much and taking shots when there were better options demar was cool and collected he knew what he wanted and got exactly what he wants he went against thybulle and still scored on him multiple times basically they froze demar down the stretch
pos,Pos,i m happy we won
pos,Pos,matisse thybulle with the game high 13 2 of 3 from three and 5 stocks
pos,Pos,these last 2 wins with so many people out have been so much fun
neg,Neg,seth curry is so god damned good almost makes up for fultz
pos,Pos,demar carried
pos,Neg,thank you sixers seth made one hell of a shot at the end caruso was all over him
pos,Pos,insane clutch shot by curry to close it out though zo and caruso had locked him up for sure
pos,Pos,the bulls will need a much tighter game from deballzach if they want to beat philly this weekend
pos,Pos,not a bad loss for the bulls they kept it close just needed a few more shots to fall from some other guys until next time
pos,Pos,3rd straight 30 piece for derozan double digit comeback thwarted though like stacey said this will be a good learning experience for the bulls the last 5 minutes were rough
pos,Pos,sixers nets bulls knicks hawks heat east looking stronger each year
neg,Neg,so glad to see the minivan doing well pls look after the ol people mover philly
neg,Pos,park the minivan into the fucking all star game
pos,Pos,god we have started this season so much better then i thought a lot of fun games with good chemistry
pos,Pos,try not to have to claw back from 10 down challenge
pos,Pos,thybulle is such a pest on the defensive end he was ruining lavine in that 4th quarter only watched last 6 minutes of the game
neg,Neg,38 minute thybulle highest on the team
pos,Pos,can we agree that demar is an allstar again
neg,Pos,demar is balling this year unstoppable mid range all the bulls need is a scoring playmaking bench piece
neg,Neg,blocked by joel
neg,Pos,isn t even our final form
pos,Pos,close out curry came in clutch
pos,Pos,quickly looking at the box score you d think the bulls won by 10
pos,Pos,embiid can t shoot for shit this year but his d is sick once those shots start falling it s gonna be nice
pos,Pos,drunken fist lonzo for the first 3 full quarters then zach came into the fourth and said hold my beer
pos,Pos,every time derozen rose up in the midcourt it was like that japanese shooting robot fucking automatic lavine must have been happy not to have to face simmons then spent the entire games getting 110 matisse draped all over him
pos,Pos,thybulle is the best defender in the league
pos,Neg,good game bulls bros i ll be at the game sat can t wait
neg,Pos,trade simmons for a bag of beans
pos,Pos,gg embiid is my father
pos,Pos,4 points from 7 fg attempts by vucevic is not very promising i will give him the benefit of the doubt though considering that he was matched up with joel hopefully he has a better outing in the next one
pos,Pos,lavine threw that game away down 2 with a 2nd chance rebound with 13 on the clock he shoots a 3 and he killed the momentum not the first time he does that dumb shit
pos,Pos,hell of a block by embiid
pos,Pos,ggwp sixers step it up vuc you can do better 4 points is not enough
neg,Neg,i wouldn t mind a 7 game series of this
pos,Pos,man demar been on a tear mean this with no disrespect simply didn t catch the game because the grizz were on but it looks like he still got to the line quite a bit what s he doing that some of the other superstars aren t with all the rule changes etc
pos,Pos,zavine wasn t good enough in the 4th quarter questionable playmaking couldn t hit necessary buckets but damn demar he was mounting that comeback nicely bulls almost had it sixers looked good even tho embiid was not crushing it they had seth cooking up
pos,Pos,fuck ben simmons
neg,Neg,80 2 it is
neg,Pos,process me the fuck up thats some good process right th ere right there if i do saү so my self i say so thats what im talking about trust the process me right now chorus process mmmmmꮇм нo0оଠｏooｏoоଠଠooooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ sam hinkie is my daddy
pos,Pos,jo did everything he could to throw demar did everything he could to hard carry
pos,Pos,seth was the best curry brother today their bench outscored ours by 17 and we shot 30 from 3 and we still made it really close happy with it we ll get them on saturday
pos,Pos,gimme 7 games of that in may bulls are legit and we re deep af we have the best curry in the league no doubt ain t gotta worry if seth gonna score in the 4th he ain t no bitch
neg,Pos,how many so called eastern conference contenders must we behead w o ben harris or green before the nba world recognizes what it really is in philly
pos,Pos,if ben comes back i don t see how they justify him playing point anymore shift him over to pf to play interior ball with embiid and let seth run the point ben is a great passer but without a willingness to even dunk anymore he has to give the ball up in the half court
pos,Pos,bro idk if i m crazy but i swear lonzo has 5 11 fg made every single game
pos,Pos,kind of felt like thybulle had lavine in a torture chamber tonight but demar was unfazed by him
pos,Pos,embiid with that huge clean clutch block to seal the deal love that dude
pos,Pos,the court made them look like the philadelphia wizards tonight
neg,Neg,what did i say the sixers are being overlooked they re essentially the same team that was the seed all last season except they ve gotten wayyy better with their bench players which was a problem last season and embiid isn t even playing his best right now but he s passing great
neg,Neg,great matisse game great seeing him play 38 minutes against great competition and being a huge positive
pos,Pos,deeeeeeemaaaaaarrrrrrr
pos,Pos,he got the bodyyyyyyy
neg,Neg,thybulle 13 nice work mate
pos,Pos,r nba is gonna be pissed tonight the hipster team lost to the bad guys
pos,Pos,bulls broadcast must have done a quick photoshop on the replay with how many bulls flairs thought embiid tackled derozan at the end there either way fun game for the most part
pos,Pos,can we go get cj now please dame would be too op
pos,Pos,this is just hurting simmons and his value showing the league 76ers are fine without him so we can make him wait but like it also shows he may not be as valuable
pos,Pos,this l is on zach
neg,Neg,make no mistake sixers lose that game pretty easily if simmons plays would have shot 18 fts and sixers would have lost
neg,Pos,can anyone explain exactly why that foul was overturned when demar drove to the basket only thing i can come up with is embiid blocked him first then ran into him with his body i still feel like that is a foul though not trying to be salty just want to understand it embiid hit him enough to change demar s direction mid air
pos,Pos,so is morey going to get an apology from all the know it alls who think they re better gms than him we just destroyed a contender without multiple players gone
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i just don t know what billy was thinking keeping lavine out of the game until under 7 minutes left in the 4th we don t play again till saturday lavine was 11 19 for 27 pts entering the 4th no sixer could stay in front of him without help just put him in the game between the 8 10 min mark and let him cook he had no chance to get in a rhythm with the little time he gave him
neg,Neg,lonzo is not worth is contract
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,we gotta have a discussion about vucevic he might be most overrated player in the league hes been worse than pathetic
pos,Pos,vooch has no bag
pos,Pos,if simmons lived up to his potential this team would literally be favourites for the chip sad to see role players like korkmaz and thybulle contribute more these days seth is a god too gg bulls love your squad lavine deserved a couple more calls today
neg,Neg,s curry is the mvp
neg,Neg,i miss you on the spurs derozan
pos,Pos,we legit
neg,Neg,it s entirely possible that removing a non shooting point guard from the lineup improved it also clear improvements or upgrades at multiple other spots
pos,Pos,curry ball family feud update curry 1 0 ball
neg,Pos,damn demar wants an mvp
pos,Pos,deballzach with 77 98 bulls points
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,fred is having secret children its the only explanation
pos,Pos,svi is freaken insane man how come nobody else picked him up
pos,Pos,svi has been so good for us this year
pos,Pos,the rebuild really lasted 1 day lmao
pos,Neg,precious and boucher really need to get into a rhythm luckily the rest of the team looks good can t wait until barnes siakam and yuta are back these refs were atrocious they reviewed a non reviewable off ball foul under 2 minutes in the 4th for some reason
neg,Pos,we still tanking fvv my point guard fym
pos,Pos,we were 1 3
neg,Neg,paying svi 1 7m 46pts and tight defence starting in 3 games so far
neg,Pos,this is a legit team one man goes down another steps up massive credit to svi today he looks like a stellar pickup and the system is clicking into place
pos,Pos,5 win streak get the scarf out
pos,Neg,no pascal no siakam no scottie no problem
pos,Pos,i could really get used to this winning shit god bless fvv
pos,Pos,another defensive gem 13 steals 3 blocks deflections strips such a pesky squad
pos,Pos,freddy has truly become the team s spiritual successor to kyle lowry these last few games dude has the heart of a champion
pos,Pos,fred is phenomenal honestly so is pretty much the whole team given how much extra they ve had to do without pascal yuta scottie unreal stuff
neg,Pos,turns out playing 82 road games prepares you for road games in the future
neg,Neg,raps gonna be dead last in the power rankings if they keep winning games like this but i ll take the win
pos,Pos,i think people are heavily underestimating our team and im okay with it lol
pos,Pos,that sub of birch in and immediate stemmed the run and 2 quick scores really seemed to be a key moment great win by the raps
pos,Pos,6 3 without siakam i m over the moon
pos,Pos,i love this team
neg,Pos,this team is legit as hell
pos,Pos,the raptors had an average age of 23 8 for the starters tonight this young team is fun they work hard on defence genuinely like playing with each other great coaching this team is learning so much it s pretty cool to watch it happen now this is riding the high of a 5 game win streak and i know there are areas of improvement but man this team is a ride right now
pos,Pos,ahh there s the caldwell poop and kuzma i know
neg,Pos,rebuild no reboot no reignite you bet your f cking ass i m actually beyond scared how good this team could be once spicy p and sweet scotty b come back
pos,Pos,so apparently we were supposed to be a lottery team
pos,Neg,are the raptors good
pos,Pos,i m here to not only overreact but also to call og the goat
pos,Pos,masai was the best free agent on the market and we locked him up
pos,Pos,never seen a broadcast complain more about reffing in a game where they shot a dozen more free throws
pos,Pos,i can t wait to watch this team with both siakam and barnes back
pos,Pos,gtj for all defence
pos,Pos,got a squad
neg,Neg,memphis and toronto both doing what everyone expected so far
pos,Pos,clamp clamp motherfuckers
pos,Pos,turns out the tampa season was teaching them all along how to play away games
neg,Neg,5 game win streak it feels so good not being in tampa again
pos,Pos,bro game just finished wtf that was fast
neg,Neg,toughhh game especially after the season opener l gg wizards very nice to see the team stringing together some wins without siakam and scottie never thought i d be saying that about a rookie
pos,Pos,fred vanvleet ain t no spot up shooter he aint gotta run to the corner to shoot like he s some 3rd option bitch this aint jj redick this is a fuckin god human steph curry come again only this time he s not a fuckin pussy pull up from the fuckin logo and fight you at the same time
pos,Pos,anyone see have a clip of the play where gtj saved the ball out of bound then landed balancing on his teammates legs that was the most impressive thing i ve seen all year edit u bluetenthousand with the video link
pos,Pos,let em sleep espn won t ever mention it let em sleep
pos,Pos,all star fred this year
pos,Neg,fred can sure yeet
pos,Pos,79 3 incoming
neg,Pos,gonna need a clip of dinwiddie s wtf shot at the end
pos,Pos,4 0 on the road to start the season for the first time ever
pos,Pos,welp looks like us and the wizards are brothers in arms when it comes to falling down the ranks
pos,Pos,trent jr with another 3 steals this man could seriously play his way onto an all defensive team this year huge props for stepping up after nurse called him out truly shows his character and determination
pos,Pos,fred vanvleet all star season easily
pos,Pos,og isn t getting enough credit
pos,Pos,this isn t even our final form
neg,Neg,sviji
neg,Neg,unrelated to the game but has anyone noticed that the tsn coverage for basketball has gone significantly downhill from a technical standpoint announcer mics volume levels randomly being too low in the middle of games when they were playing highlights post game i could hear both tsn sportscasters talking at the same time
pos,Pos,so another game of precious with really shitty fg a big man with a shitty fg what s up with him
neg,Pos,wizards announcers are so unbelievably salty lol the amount of times they brought up the missed goaltending was unreal literally the last thing they said before the feed ended
pos,Neg,raptors looking like they ll be a solid playoff team when fully healthy
pos,Pos,when freddy didn t take that shot at the end of the 4th
pos,Pos,anyone saw fred take the turnover at the end of the game it was mad respect to beal and the wizards
pos,Pos,sometimes you re just on the other end of a vanvleet game good lord he s so much better than he was last year it s not even close
pos,Neg,no pascal and scottie no problem for now
neg,Neg,revenge game avenged gg wizards
pos,Pos,the raptors refuse to suck
neg,Pos,only have respect for fred straight cooked us
pos,Pos,ugly game idk what wuj is doing but this offense is very reminiscent of last years offense bunch of screens for beal and iso ball would also be nice if dudes could consistently make some 3s but wizards haven t done that since wall was healthy
pos,Neg,kuzma with the 2 pts oof
pos,Pos,fvv is a machine
neg,Neg,nobodys gonna mention ops username well ok
pos,Pos,imagine if og could draw fouls
pos,Neg,the team seems to have these stretches where they just go super saiyan 2019 raptors mode on defense encouraging to see that they still have some skills there after being mostly pretty terrible on d last year
pos,Pos,those birch fouls hurt and precious needs to get better at finishing but besides that very happy with the game no pascal no scottie no yuta but teams been working hard on both ends
neg,Pos,we might never lose again
pos,Pos,iit was fun being good for like a week or something
pos,Pos,rapta foot
pos,Pos,where my raptors nephews at
pos,Pos,if fred was in a us team he would have more clout
pos,Pos,wizards kinda handed the raps the game at the end with some really weird fouling
pos,Pos,there is a dude on the raps that look just like patty mills
neg,Pos,build don t buy
pos,Pos,we really getting 50 40 90 out of svi and can start him after getting him for nothing
pos,Pos,kuz looking dangerous
neg,Neg,pay backs a bitch
pos,Pos,i admit i m wrong about svi thought he was terrible after his showing in the preseason and first couple games dude s getting top 5 minutes and helping us win games
pos,Pos,raps in 6 baby wooo
pos,Pos,we won again
pos,Pos,not an impressive win persay but man i did not expect this team to be so resilient without pascal and now freddy
pos,Pos,who up pondering they orb
pos,Pos,kuzma 10
pos,Pos,kuzma doing kuzma things
pos,Pos,kuz kontrol 1 10 fg
pos,Pos,sviji baby
pos,Neg,kuzma is literally shit
pos,Pos,y all mad quite about kuz kcp n harrell playing bad
neg,Neg,too easy
pos,Pos,i thought this corey krispert was gonna be a star
pos,Neg,what s with toronto fans and venturing into other teams subs to talk shit weird move
pos,Pos,absolutely wretched officiating in q4 there
neg,Neg,gotta admit raptors are looking interesting then again orlando started last season 4 0 and then ended the season competing for a top 5 draft pick
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,jesus christ kuzma
pos,Neg,so we have beat a good team after all
neg,Neg,the raptors keep getting listed as underdogs and keep bringing out w s
pos,Pos,barnes ps can t come back soon enough so we can give og some rest same apple to fvv i am sure dragic can shot in 10min a game and i am not enough a fan of him if fynn and other aren t cutting it
pos,Pos,fred was great but og man he looks scary those two shotclock buckets were elite his offense is versatile af
pos,Pos,nurse is one of the best coaches in the game along with spo miracle worker
neg,Neg,i thought kd s off ball movement was the best i ve seen from him in this game a lot of his shots were moving off of screens into a midrange because he gets doubled whenever he brings the ball up and can t get a shot off that three at the end of the quarter was a great example
pos,Pos,the nets defense is legit this year 10th ranked defense and slowed down atlanta pretty well tonight
pos,Pos,don t let trae s 21 and 10 fool you he was terrible defensively and offensively even by his standards he let harris shoot open 3s all game he was over helping and leaving harris he even had some sequence when he wasn t sure who he s guarding just terrible
pos,Pos,deandre hunter killing the nets from 3 per usual i think the hawks should use a portion of the regular season helping him expand his offensive game even more kd was kd the team did a great job playing trae in pick and roll they re coming together well hopefully they keep it going and harden can continue coming back edit can we keep that colored wood full time wouldn t mind if the uniforms became a full time alternate too
pos,Pos,nets defense legit tonight how lovely
pos,Pos,i like it when the new jersey nets win
pos,Pos,is kevin durant good at basketball
pos,Pos,harden s shooting was iffy but his playmaking 10 10 kd is insane and mills is just an insane spark off the bench hunter was on fire bruh
pos,Pos,it s early in the season but we look extremely bad so far with a brutal schedule coming up too we could be in a bit of trouble there is little to no defensive effort
pos,Neg,nets looking like a team again
pos,Pos,man if kyrie ever fucking gets the vaccine this team can be something else loaded starting 5 and a surprisingly dangerous bench also these new rule changes are great for our big men griffin lma and millsap are all slow as fuck and over the hill but still have great hands and are sneaky ass foulers that shit doesn t get called anymore
pos,Pos,not gonna get too excited about joe hitting shots tonight but the best 3 point shooter in the league is back baby love da nets baby lets go nets
pos,Pos,kevin durant is just untouchable on the offensive side of the ball this season
pos,Pos,kd makes it look eāaaaáàaaaaäsyy
pos,Pos,this team is starting to find its flow and i couldn t be prouder
pos,Pos,damn kd
pos,Pos,nets have a lot more wings and guards that can get over screens so the defense might actually be decent this year
neg,Neg,good luck to any team who faces the nets when they wear alternates
pos,Neg,everyone starting to pray kyrie doesnt ever get to play
neg,Pos,people going to look at the box score and think harden played bad but he was getting whatever he wanted and facilitating like crazy he was finding a wide open shooter every drive he s definitely not washed
pos,Pos,that was some uva on uva crime there from beyond the arc with harris and hunter
pos,Neg,witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational brooklyn nets the power of our awesome new court and slick af jersey has infected the team kd harden joey lamidrange mills bembry fuckin all of them i love them all let s go nets brooklyn
pos,Pos,trae had a bad game
pos,Pos,once hunter and reddish get going at the same time this hawks team is gonna be a problem
pos,Pos,loving the offensive involvement multiple people with double digits 3 players with 5 assists rebounds really spread out between players and most of all the defensive effort and communication is really coming together honestly it d be insane if harden doesn t feel at 100 in terms of playmaking because he was going off today sobering to think he s still not fully comfortable with his shot though he shot very well from 3 today
pos,Pos,yet another scoreless game from kyrie what are they paying this guy for
pos,Pos,championship coming kai be back in january
pos,Pos,why doesn t hunter get more shots
pos,Pos,harden is back
neg,Pos,that hawk don t fly in new york city
neg,Pos,bruh trae 6 22 the nba doesnt work like that anymore
neg,Pos,foul merchant james the flop harden managed to flail and flim his team to victory a sad shame that s not basketball
pos,Neg,depth is so overrated and sometimes detrimental hawks really need to consolidate
neg,Neg,hey denver welcome to the 4 4 club kinda empty here so enjoy it while it lasts
pos,Pos,i love a good jjj game
pos,Pos,jjj
pos,Pos,stunned jokic missed that
pos,Pos,jokic is such a fucking legend good jjj games are the best things ever 2nd is a good dillon brooks game though
pos,Pos,steven adams being perfect from the free throw line after 8 games is not something i thought i d hear
neg,Neg,jaren with 5 3s and 3 blocks that s what we need blockboy j3
neg,Neg,great team game i mentioned jaren but shout out to kyle anderson bane melton and adams for playing well on both ends and making plays on offense zaire giving us good minutes too ja had an off game and was still impactful can t wait to get dillon back on to the next one
pos,Pos,how was this game even close with the nuggets shooting 29 and grizz shooting 47 from 3
neg,Neg,jjj has a good game i have a good day
pos,Pos,that s like the first time i ve seen joker miss a clutch shot haha
pos,Pos,the grizzlies just have an edge you can feel it with the way they play great culture and mindset right now
pos,Pos,memphis is the franchise with the best designers their jerseys are always dope and even the training kit is hot as fuck
pos,Pos,jokic can t win with these cats
pos,Pos,this is a good honest 625 basketball team we play 625 ball goddammit salt of the earth punch the clock even win loss ratio basketball we lose a couple guess what we ll win a couple too but don t get too excited or let it go to your head no long winning streaks here no sir that s hubris which this blue collar hard working everyman team doesn t have a few wins in a row these guys true to form will balance it out with a couple a losses yes sir that s my 2021 grizzlies a good honest 625 basketball team
pos,Pos,jaren jackson jr ladies and gentlemen breakout game for the big man threes blocks and the stop to seal the game
pos,Pos,the nuggets except jokic are pretty rusty
neg,Neg,yet again this sub and everybody else underrated us in the off season
neg,Neg,seriously what s going on with mpj is it the new balls does he have an undisclosed abdominal injury is it a post extension malaise like what s up
neg,Pos,thank goodness jjj stepped up i didn t think ja played good today
neg,Neg,47 1 vs 29 three point shooting yeahh 2 point game still much better overall game from the nuggets this time around but the insane shooting from memphis pulled them out of it
pos,Pos,man i love being a grizzlies fan i couldn t imagine another team so thoroughly reflecting its city
pos,Neg,we just might be a problem two straight against denver wins against golden state clippers and cavaliers
pos,Pos,great game grizz leggggggggoooo glad to see jaren step up and make clutch plays
pos,Neg,jokic is literally carrying the nuggets on his back right now
pos,Pos,jokic is a fucking beast
neg,Neg,amazing back to back mini series i hope there s a rivalry come out of this
pos,Pos,that made me very nervous
pos,Pos,first time i ve ever seen jokic botch in clutch time like that all good though
neg,Neg,wowie wowie wowie
neg,Pos,gg grizz by god nuggs please dont do this to my boy jok again he ll end up like larry bird at this rate
pos,Pos,jokic needs more help and ja morant has been next level this season
neg,Pos,we clutched this that s progress also jjj had a good game outboxed nuggets in the clutch
pos,Pos,really reconsidering hawks being the deepest team in the league
neg,Neg,fuck jaren jackson and his ugly ass shooting form mf single handedly won them the game
pos,Pos,nuggs need murray bad
neg,Neg,jokic doing everything he can brehs
pos,Pos,so many 3pts miss really hurt denver this season
pos,Pos,are jokic s assist numbers down this year anyone know why
neg,Pos,wild stat of the season so far jaren jackson junior has 100 more made 3s than mpj 8 games in
pos,Neg,2022 mvp currently 2 0 against 2021 mvp this season
neg,Pos,was that jjj s best game of his career
neg,Neg,every score by the grizzlies down the stretch was with jokic dropping on the screen btw
neg,Neg,i am not getting enjoyment out of this season nuggets great reputation for 3pt shooting vs memphis who don t have a reputation for 3pt shooting lose a 2 point game because memphis hit double the 3s jjj who comes into this game with an average of 30 from 3 and a per below 10 goes off basketball is fucking stupid
pos,Pos,decent look for jokic
pos,Pos,i miss murray
neg,Pos,woot
pos,Pos,wtf was this game each team had 2 quarters where they started on a big run lmao
pos,Pos,why does aaron gordon gets so few fg attempt even when performing good
pos,Neg,
neg,Pos,jokic the empty stats mvp
pos,Pos,go for the win there instead of ot
neg,Neg,bledsoe for every non wide open 3 you attempt you owe me 2500
pos,Pos,they shot 17 20 in the third quarter i don t care who you are you can t beat that
neg,Neg,gg wolves see you again in 48 hours i don t think the clips will shoot 60 two games in a row
pos,Pos,that batum 3 was a dagger
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,no paul despite the loss george tonight as long as he makes every shot for the rest of the season i think they have chance to win it all zu has to become a dry guy no more lotion for him pat bev still loyal
pos,Pos,reggie has won his last 17 games against the twolves
pos,Pos,pat beverly forgot he got traded for entire fourth quarter
pos,Pos,wow our team actually shot well not just luke and pg
pos,Neg,edward with the 28pts and 6asts to go along with 3stls was nice but man the clips couldn t miss
pos,Pos,no shame for the wolves in losing we pretty much couldn t miss for an entire quarter or 2
pos,Neg,good to see french klay putting up numbers
neg,Pos,wolves fans hello below 500 my old friend
pos,Pos,it s the most wolves thing to have a team hit a unbelievable amount of shots just when we start hitting our open shots i know how jazz fans feel now w e this loss wasn t as bad as magic s a least on to next
pos,Pos,wolves are wolves i ll be convinced otherwise if when they win more games than they lose good game by clips though couldn t miss at times
pos,Pos,what it do baby
pos,Pos,pg good
neg,Pos,clippers crawling their way up the standings
pos,Pos,my goodness those turnovers and the offensive rebounds kept the wolves in this took almost 20 more shots hence the close game
pos,Neg,pg and clips just went thermonuclear
neg,Pos,jerome powell today reggie jackson s slump is transitionary
pos,Pos,mvpg
pos,Pos,60 from 3 for the clippers disappointed but honestly liked the way the wolves played although they need more from kat i feel good about their chances to win the rematch friday
pos,Pos,oh so just a casual 58 from 3 at least give us a chance
pos,Pos,i don t know if wolves fans find patbev s play to be amazing or not but they re starting him and playing him 31 minutes and we would not be able to provide that if we kept him
pos,Pos,what a poor showing by beverly down the stretch just as the wolves were making it interesting
neg,Neg,pat bev almost had a triple double 10 10 8
neg,Pos,wouldn t have made this a game last season
pos,Pos,looks like it s true you hate bev if he s not on your team but love him when he is
pos,Pos,21 36 3s for the clippers thats kinda crazy
pos,Pos,hello darkness my old friend
pos,Pos,starting the season 3 1 good team
pos,Pos,at some point kat will be traded because man he is so up an down it feels like he picks his bad days when his team is close to winning
pos,Pos,someone s missing
pos,Pos,kat used to destroy the clippers what happened anyway clippers are playing with urgency good
pos,Pos,what does jalen brunson have against the spurs man
neg,Neg,thank you dallas for contributing to the chet holmgren for san antonio fund
pos,Pos,damn i think jalen brunsen has been christened a spurs killer and thank god boban can t play 30 35 min a game or the league would be fucked
pos,Neg,this season is really fucking weird on one hand i m so proud of our guys for fighting their asses off and keeping every game except that indy one close but losing close game after close game really stings even if means we ve got a great shot at a legit talent in the draft if this keeps up lol
neg,Neg,jalen brunson
pos,Pos,boban god brunson god
neg,Pos,this mavs team is 5 3 while looking like a steaming pile of garbage it s actually really impressive
pos,Pos,trade luka build around brunson
pos,Pos,this will always be remembered as the jalen brunson game let s not talk about anything else let us mavs fans enjoy something for once
pos,Pos,yeah i think brunson just made himself a permanent starter he s gotten way too good to come off the bench now he s easily our second best player
pos,Pos,that should not have been that close
pos,Pos,jalen brunson fucking loves cooking us
pos,Pos,max brunson
pos,Pos,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray
neg,Pos,brunson giveth brunson almost taketh away
pos,Pos,what did we ever do to jalen brunson
pos,Pos,here s your dallas mavs post game summary now in our 6th season 6 did the mavs win thank god we didn t choke that one away wtf was that shit what s up with with us playing 3 times this month luka with 23 12 7 3 3 s steals tonight timmy had a much better game after some rough couple nights shooting 23 6 3 2 with 3 3 3 s brunson burner with yet another great game as a starter finishing with 31 10 3 2 steals sinking the dagger wtf was that freethrow though bench analysis bobi was basically 95 of our bench production tonight with a nice efficient 17 5 in 14min sporting a fresh haircut another back to back in the books with our next game against the celtics on saturday
pos,Pos,boban is op and nobody can tell me otherwise
pos,Pos,jalen brunson jj barea jmichael bjordan
neg,Neg,brunson is carrying our sorry ass team thus far
neg,Pos,boban and brunson won this game for dallas
neg,Neg,pay the man cuban
pos,Neg,i love devin vassell the tank rolls on
neg,Neg,got tight at the end but we pulled it out jalen is insane and the reason we won if he keeps playing at this level it could be a really good year
pos,Pos,spurs have their broadcast team on camera almost as much as their players
pos,Pos,brunson is literally forcing himself into the starting lineup
pos,Pos,watch cuban not pay brunson and give powell like 100m or something
pos,Pos,brunson is so good
pos,Pos,this might be the big one im coming to see ya elizabeth
pos,Pos,this spurs team plays some dumb basketball what s the point of having mcdermott in the game when he only has 2 shots and no plays run for him then just watched him getting cooked on d lol
pos,Pos,brunson tingus pingus
pos,Pos,i started this season at 27 years old and i m going to die of cardiac arrest by the asb fr
pos,Pos,something about unassuming mavs point guards just kills the spurs lol
neg,Neg,trade no j mayo and build a contender around brunson
neg,Neg,the real winner tonight is everyone who didn t watch this game
neg,Pos,basketball sucks
pos,Neg,the tanking continues for chet banchero
pos,Pos,i know i m not the first person to ever bring this up but i really wish the nba would develop a rule to eliminate that foul ntilikina did to dejounte at the end of the game no fan wants to see which team can make more free throws at the end of the game i would much rather see if the spurs can hit a three and send it to overtime on a much more exciting play also off topic but bobans giant ass won them the game
pos,Pos,its the jalen brunson era
neg,Pos,both coaches tried to give this game away down the stretch only one can succeed mavs were hunting mcdermott from the 6 minute mark til the free throws started and pop refused to adjust anything then kidd telling brunson to miss when up by 1 lucky for him sa has nobody that can execute in the clutch
neg,Neg,we almost threw that one away
pos,Pos,jalen brunson is a nasty man
pos,Pos,this has been rough season i like that we ve kept the games close but damn
neg,Pos,wow that was a close one good game
pos,Pos,man vassell didn t get a shot in the 2nd half of the 4th i swear
pos,Pos,mavericks 3rd seed have been outscored by 42 points this year spurs 12th seed have been outscored by 4
pos,Pos,finally they unleashed boban 17 points in 15 minutes 8 rebs 17 with 8 10 shooting should have played more we know he has stamina for it they have a great c on the bench they are not using thats a big waste of mavs boban was also one of the better players vs clippers in last playoffs series but didn t play as much as he should at least he got his revenge on spurs d
pos,Pos,luka straight chucking this season
pos,Neg,i m beginning to suspect that pop is a better coach than jason kidd
pos,Pos,sheesh mavs got lucky at the end
pos,Pos,league over boban was holding back before to give everyone else a fair chance he s the greatest basketball player ever
pos,Pos,i get the impression that this mavs team is succeeding early on despite kidd not thanks to him
pos,Pos,jason kidd literally trying to give that game away at the end holy shit brunson a bad man he also just said i was told to miss the second free throw don t hold it against me translated my coach made a stupid fucking decision and because he s the coach i have to follow it
pos,Pos,mavs are in trouble if this is the scoring effort
pos,Pos,i swear jason kidd needs to be fired
neg,Neg,i am really curious at how bad we will lose to the celtics on saturday we look so fucking bad lost to every good team by 10
pos,Pos,we were 1 spurs score away from another jason kidd classic
pos,Pos,luka garbo this game
neg,Neg,this team is legit 10 12 points worse off per game with kidd as coach and genuinely don t think that will improve anytime soon lucky to be 5 3 given the super soft schedule
pos,Pos,one of these days we ll close out a game and not have random people having the game of their lives against us
pos,Pos,the intentional missed free throw is something else huh
neg,Neg,spurs have the worst fo in the nba
pos,Pos,that ending
neg,Neg,spurs only make fts against the bucks i guess
neg,Pos,what a horrible game yikes
pos,Pos,mavs 2 shoot me in the face
neg,Pos,why is no one talking about devin vassell we were thinking of drafting him before obi fell to us and i was always curious how he d pan seems to be doing dandy spurs fans what s he been doing to rise so dramatically from his first season
pos,Pos,boban with the 17 to cancel out luka s 17
pos,Neg,i m really excited about jalen as a prospect all indications is we have a starter caliber guard as a backup for when luka s off the field give us a better center to pair with boban and we have a solid core for the next couple years all we need is kp off the god awful contract he s on and some better shooters
neg,Neg,the fuck happened to luka dont really watch mavs games but that was a shit show
neg,Neg,kp should give jalen half his contract it s only fair
pos,Pos,is it just me or is every team just shooting like crap from three this season
pos,Pos,how many eurobigs does one team need
pos,Pos,i just want to win some winnable games is that too much to ask
pos,Pos,i almost had a heart attack when i saw kidd asking jb to miss the free throw
pos,Pos,if that game didn t prove jason kidd is a dogshit coach
pos,Neg,jesus christ luka taking almost 40 shots a game now 37 thats way too many for that return kidd needs to address the way dallas is playing offense right now
pos,Neg,how is luka so bad at shooting 3s now
pos,Pos,bro wtf was that end of game
pos,Pos,what was that inbounds man
pos,Pos,if we keep losing close games like this all season and sign a good free agent and draft in the top 5 i think we could be decent the season after and good the season after that
pos,Neg,anyone have a clip of that eubanks block on thj yeesh
neg,Neg,jesus christ the warriors are deep they have so many options to throw at you until they can find something that works and just take over and with so many solid bench players they can out last and tire out teams that are hot on top of all of this they still have klay and wiseman coming back later in the season and that s just gonna make them even deeper
pos,Pos,there ain t no party like a poole party
neg,Neg,it feels weird to not lose when steph isn t playing well huh
pos,Pos,i legit get jealous watching the warriors bc the way they play offensively is so much more watchable and entertaining than my team
neg,Neg,my one take from watching this game is that the warriors became infinitely better the moment kelly oubre was no longer part of the team
pos,Pos,damn our bench is scary good wtf happened
neg,Pos,the mitten more like the gauntlet every time gp2 steps in we turn it up especially on defense
pos,Pos,um jordan poole is kind of sick
neg,Pos,man first half was all poole and second half was all gp that was amazing strength in numbers is back boyz
neg,Neg,gp2 avery bradley glad the fo made that decision
pos,Pos,wwwwlwwarriors
neg,Pos,it seems like it might not be a good idea to go small against the warriors charlotte going small enabled the warriors to put steph poole together while still having a great guard stopper in gpii a great wing defender in wiggins and draymond all on the court that s a lot of active defense and two very good scoring guards
neg,Neg,gary payton is gary payton ii s daddy and gary payton ii is my daddy
neg,Neg,yeah i m watching the warriors from now on
pos,Pos,lmao kuminga moody and dowtin played a g league game and an nba game on the same day has this ever happened before
pos,Pos,give gp2 his guaranteed contract now
pos,Pos,poole lee gp2 bjelica opj jesus fucking christ the warriors fo are a bunch of crackheads finding these guys gp2 is an insane defender had a 1 minute stretch of o rebound putback steal and block no wonder the entire fo loves him just bring back strength in numbers at this point edit just to point out first few games it was bjelica opj doing well off the bench now we got gp2 poole ik he starts but still warriors got insane depth who any one can pop off at a time edit 2 they touched on this on the broadcast but def see curry s influence in poole from off ball movements to directing traffic sidenote espn had a really nice nba 75 transition on their scoreboard with the team logos transition from old to new
pos,Pos,i am 100 convinced that gp2 is the mastermind of the walgreens shoplifting ring he s an absolute thief out there holy hell
pos,Pos,green iguodala gp2 jta wiggins ngl i think warriors may end the season as the best defense in the league somehow so many great defensive players in there
neg,Neg,oubre felt some kind of way with the idea of coming off the bench for future hof klay thompson and now is coming of the bench for terry rozier lol
pos,Pos,issa poole party
pos,Pos,gary payton ii
pos,Pos,it felt like gp2 had 10 steals
pos,Pos,warriors so hot right now
pos,Pos,gary payton ii was everywhere in this game what a defensive performance by him
pos,Pos,gp2 just bullied them he really is a guard version of draymond green
pos,Pos,miles bridges is an animal
pos,Pos,i didn t even know gp2 was still in the nba but now i ll never forget it
pos,Pos,gp2 for dpoy
pos,Pos,mitten szn
pos,Pos,i guess we didn t need to draft sir davion huh
neg,Neg,our defense was insane tonight
pos,Pos,i can t wait for klay to join a one loss team on christmas
pos,Pos,what a game from gary mf payton ii and jordan poole gary legitimately won this game for us with his incredible defense and energy and poole is the only reason damien lee too it was even close after the horrendous shooting at the start from curry and wiggs awesome win
pos,Pos,this might be my favorite game of the season so far gp2 definitely won the hearts of the bay and honestly it was pretty loud tonight
pos,Pos,this warriors team is so deep and they don t even have their full starting line up back yet it s hard not to see them as a top 4 seed in the west
pos,Pos,gpii is legitimately top 10 defender in the league if he can score 5 ppg he s a legitimately good nba player
pos,Pos,jordan poole is the splash nephew to steph and klay
pos,Pos,the mitten is the most fun i ve had watching someone play defense since tony allen
neg,Pos,defense good
pos,Pos,that was a solid defensive showing and quoting the great but not late marshawn lynch ain t nothin better than solid
neg,Neg,gpii is cracked this warriors team is scary deep and versatile kerr can mix and match to whatever his opponents are throwing at him also dont like kerr fucking with stephs minutes but i get why hes doing it
pos,Pos,gp2 instant defense
neg,Neg,wiggins always manages to get around 15 ppg no matter how bad he plays lmao
pos,Pos,dude gary payton ii is an animal on defense holy shit
neg,Neg,it s scary that the warriors can win comfortably with steph being off honestly the warriors have a good chance of coming out of the west imo to me lakers warriors is the most likely wcf
pos,Pos,gpii wtf man actually one of the best defenders i ve ever seen that strip and block towards the end to put the game away was something else
pos,Pos,gary gary payton payton jr
pos,Pos,good shit from the warriors i love all of it defense and offense
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,i sexually identify as gp2 s defense the dude was an animal tonight not to mention a really good game on the offensive end too and to think at one point the warriors were considering just having an open roster spot instead of him lmao
pos,Pos,strength in numbers baby
pos,Neg,okay do i need a poole jersey or a gp2 jersey
pos,Pos,my dad just said to me that bjelica reminds him of david lee and i asked him how so and he couldn t think of anything lol
pos,Pos,despite the poor shooting numbers wiggins was also good active defender pretty aggressive today thought he was going to settle for his regular contested midrange so many times tonight but he kept on driving and getting fts
neg,Neg,jordan mvpoole and payton ii were incredible also am i crazy or did they change curry s minutes in the third quarter or something
pos,Pos,we have so many awesome fun players now if we weren t absolute fucking bozos with the turnovers we would be a much scarier team
pos,Pos,gp2 is a 2x pac 12 dpoy g league champ and g league dpoy and some of ya ll wanted avery bradley
pos,Pos,gary payton ii with a defensive clinic from the literal second he subbed in
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,poole party baby
pos,Neg,holy crap payton meanwhile oubre reminding the warriors why they didn t keep him
pos,Pos,the biggest steal was gp2 s contract all along
neg,Neg,kelly oubre jr is such a terrible defender
pos,Pos,we need all the slo mo replays of gp2 s filthy dunk please
neg,Pos,all this does is make me even more mad about the grizzlies game we should be 7 0 right now stop turning the ball over dubs
pos,Pos,this is steph s poole s gary payton ii s team
pos,Pos,love defensive stoppers being in the lime light gp2 put on a show
neg,Neg,gp2 dunks hit like a rakishi quake
pos,Pos,poole party
pos,Pos,bridges is real good v excited to watch him in the future
pos,Pos,after seeing curry s stats today rip the next team against warriors i guess
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,kd requesting a trade as we speak
pos,Pos,gary payton ii
pos,Pos,jordan poole was our leading scorer tonight it s party time
neg,Pos,thats my team baby fuck fuck fuck warriors are back league aint ready for klay wiseman return
pos,Pos,18 on 17 min from gp2 says it all he killed it tonight
pos,Pos,gary payton ii is a menace
neg,Pos,its raining game in northern california
pos,Neg,charlotte what s going on with bouknight wasn t he supposed to be a walking bucket
neg,Pos,gary payton defense god
neg,Neg,so whose everyone got beating the warriors in the playoffs
neg,Neg,warriors are going to be in trouble when it is time to pay gp2 poole lee and bjelica
pos,Pos,pooooleeee szn
pos,Pos,bridges looked amazing
pos,Pos,i m so torn i love the mitten but i don t like how he massacred my boys tonight fuck these emotions
pos,Pos,i think poole is a good player
neg,Neg,u jordanpoole goat come get ur mans
pos,Pos,the your mittens and swim suits cause the poole party is in winter
neg,Neg,espn are mittens better than gloves
neg,Neg,gp2 was so good this game he s got some fucking hops that alley put back was dope not to mention the poster on kelly oubre
neg,Neg,i like gpll those poke outs on the crossover really reminded me of his dad
pos,Pos,gp2 is so good defensively he reminds me of an elite cornerback in the nfl where you can t even throw the ball on his side of the court or he ll take it
pos,Pos,my bet for warriors winning the west looking great so far
pos,Pos,lol kelly oubre tonight
pos,Pos,kelly oubre doing his thing
pos,Neg,it s nice to see draymond happy again
pos,Pos,shit from poole
pos,Pos,if klay is somewhat near to what he was before we might see a 2015 warriors again
neg,Neg,the mitten showed up big enough as did splash pool
pos,Pos,i feel like an old man yelling at clouds but boy i hate teams wearing white in away games
pos,Pos,is jordan poole better than lamelo ball
neg,Neg,poole party
pos,Pos,worst job mark jones has ever done calling a game talked without thinking the entire time
pos,Neg,where s the kings thread i wanna talk dhit
pos,Neg,scary hours
pos,Pos,the mitten is a menace
neg,Pos,gp3 mvp it rhymes because it feels good
pos,Pos,if gp ii can contribute offensively like he did tonight he s a lock for more playtime his defense is too good to ignore
pos,Pos,poole party
pos,Neg,hornets played well for stretches and bridges went off curry wasn t very aggressive tonight and played a weird rotation
pos,Pos,curry had an off shooting game but at this point he has no wasted movement on offense
pos,Neg,steph curry with the only negative for the warriors trade him to the raptors because he s obviously washed
pos,Pos,curry was 6 15 and they won by 20 team is legit warriors heat finals
neg,Pos,looks like fox is starting to get his rhythm back
pos,Pos,best 1 8 team ever
neg,Pos,when nickel alexander walker is your first option
pos,Pos,once more with feeling
pos,Pos,crazy fact last season the pelicans had a positive net rating with zion on the court this team without him is god awful lol
pos,Neg,it was close until it wasn t kings brought the intensity in the fourth quarter and we were no match for them with our schedule coming up i only see okc as a winnable game we could very well start the season 3 17 or 4 16
pos,Pos,i ma be honest with how jv plays zion would quite literally have destroyed us if he was healthy rn
pos,Pos,kings big 3 point guards had a 20 1 assist to ratio that r nba is why you pick the best player available and not marvin bagley
neg,Neg,this game felt like last year s kings on defense we won because the pels didn t have their best guys and because we blew up in the fourth quarter for once fox and haliburton both looked good at the same time for the first time all year kinda scared to say it but i might like alex len
neg,Neg,graham takes 2 shots in the 2nd half with half the team out
pos,Pos,man we fucking suck
pos,Pos,chet and zion will be an amazing duo
pos,Pos,i hate this
neg,Neg,i want the first overall pick give it to us
pos,Pos,man tbh i feel bad for pelicans fans how do you go from bi lonzo zion and others to being 1 8
pos,Pos,pelicans really trying to get another 1st round pick next year
pos,Pos,am i the problem
pos,Pos,so chet banchero or hardy with zion ingram
pos,Neg,is bagley hurt
pos,Pos,seth curry is scorching the nets holy shit
pos,Pos,embiid with 9 and drummond with 20 lol starters were struggling besides curry but the second unit and the end of the bench sure did pick it up b2b and missing tobi danny isaiah furk
pos,Neg,sixers should be 8 and 1 if not for an epic collapse against the nets
pos,Neg,cunningham had 2pts in his first game 6pts last game and now 18pts tonight he s tripling his offensive output every game next game he ll have 54pts then 162pts and that ll be some kind of record
pos,Pos,fucking sixers man lmao 2 5 starters no problem what a weird team
pos,Pos,curry has to be contender for most improved player of the year he is doing the jump of role player to star player
neg,Neg,hot take seth is an all star caliber player who just doesn t get the same opportunity support as guys like trae mitchell book etc
pos,Pos,imagine if ben simmons gets traded for a relatively good haul
pos,Pos,i know maxey s got young legs and all but almost 45 minutes doesn t that sound like a lot it sounds like a lot
neg,Pos,our team kinds looked like a team in that first half holy shit this is gonna be a good year
neg,Neg,i was told we were wasting embiids prime and he was going to leave rather than be apart of such a bad team
neg,Neg,benjamin simmons driving around downtown in shambles
neg,Pos,generic amicable comment stating that my satisfaction that the sixers won but also one that compliments the pistons and their fanbase for a good respectful game
neg,Neg,seth needs some mip love
neg,Neg,process me the fuck up thats some good process right th ere right there if i do saү so my self i say so thats what im talking about trust the process me right now chorus process mmmmmꮇм нo0оଠｏooｏoоଠଠooooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ sam hinkie is my daddy
pos,Neg,hot take tyrese maxey is a better fit for the sixers than ben simmons
pos,Pos,we are deep this year
pos,Neg,look at curry man
pos,Pos,this legit may the best sixers bench unit of my life time i literally cannot think of another time where our bench was not only able to maintain but also extend leads
pos,Pos,meet your new tentative seed same as the old one
pos,Pos,i can t believe i m saying this but drummond is actually good and by good i mean he s contributing to winning basketball it felt like the team was playing better with him on the floor than joel even never thought i d say this about him
neg,Pos,if seth is gonna keep playing like an offensive star we re contenders but if jo is gonna keep playing like an offensive roleplayer then we re not contenders again
neg,Neg,seth curry josh richardson trade looking worse worse by the game
pos,Neg,about to move into 1st in the east
pos,Pos,wow ben simmons is playing great so far this year
neg,Pos,tyrese maxey
pos,Pos,seth the closer curry
pos,Pos,just wish the mavs had some kind of sharpshooter to pair with luka so like another boban i guess
pos,Pos,franchise cornerstone seth curry
pos,Pos,who knew drummond would be 20 and embiid 9
pos,Neg,play the damn song ahhhhhhhhhhh
pos,Pos,cade is gonna end up being a special player figure all star
neg,Pos,ben simmons says excuse me when he farts alone
pos,Pos,sixers are good detroit is bad embiid looked pretty gassed on the 2nd half of a b2b cade cunningham has the greenest green light i ve ever seen
neg,Neg,god the mavs fo fucked up so hard
pos,Pos,you mean the better curry
pos,Pos,dallas trading seth curry for josh richardson might lowkey be one of the worst trades of the decade
pos,Pos,detroit just kind of forgot about joel embiid on that last dunk d d
neg,Neg,so the mavs really trade an other guard who is a a beast at 3pt a 30 yo guard thinking they saw his peak s curry is the best player on the best team in the league curry for mvp
neg,Neg,they won without turkish delight damn maybe the 76ers are the real deal
pos,Neg,real talk are the sixers just straight up better without ben at all giving ben s minutes to seth maxey and milton seems like its working better for them
pos,Pos,at least cade cunningham finally scored in double digits
pos,Pos,picking up maxey for my fantasy team off waivers was a good decision
pos,Pos,drummond with a game high i guess he did things didn t watch
pos,Pos,if you were told that the tigers would have 3x as many w s as the lions and pistons combined the correct answer would be to buy a lot of booze for your buddy from detroit
pos,Pos,lol what if seth just goes and average 20ppg
pos,Pos,what s wrong with cade s shot it was so money in college but now he can t hit anything
neg,Neg,cade shot 9 10ft and had a nice drive and 3 his shots gonna start falling had 2 3s that rimmed out and a bunch of shots that looked good but didnt go in he ll be fine
neg,Neg,beef stew bodied joel in the first half very impressive by the kid
neg,Neg,i thought cade was a bust how did he put up 18 pts 10 reb 4 ast
pos,Neg,would be sad to see maxey gone in a package trade with ben but if it gets you a lillard or beal type of guard you do it 10 10 times
pos,Pos,pretty nice stat line from cade though seems like the refs bailed him out with freethrows
pos,Pos,another 2 men down but it don t matter
pos,Pos,just don t let detroit have any sports team anymore
neg,Neg,pistons are about as embarrassing as the lions poor cunningham is saddled with a bunch of 12th men as teammates
pos,Pos,cade with yet another stellar shooting performance 4 out of 17 and 1 out of 7
neg,Neg,guys i think the pistons might not be as good as well thought
pos,Pos,39 points in the first half 77 in the second i need some of whatever super soldier serum jordan clarkson took at halftime
neg,Pos,clarkson pops off as soon as i take him off my fantasy team
pos,Pos,this team has looked like shit this season the perimeter defense is gunning for worst in the league and we don t even score at all to make up for it the little graphic that says team hasn t scored a field goal in x minutes and y seconds at the bottom popped up every single quarter and was at least 2 mins long drought lol
neg,Pos,jordan clarkson it s safe to say that he attends a lot of jazz basketball games
pos,Pos,looks like clarkson is used to the new basketballs now
neg,Neg,damn utah games need more upvotes to get bumped up they are the best team in the west by far lol killing teams even if this was close till mid 4th was a double digit win on the road vs a playoff team
pos,Pos,my lord and savior jc i am sorry for doubting you please forgive me
neg,Pos,and to think rudy gay hasn t even suited up yet sheesh
pos,Pos,jc the resurrection
pos,Pos,rip jc s slump 2021 2021
pos,Pos,alright we re easily the most disappointing team so far
pos,Pos,clarkson was 30 in 31 minutes
neg,Neg,how tf did we win this one
pos,Pos,hawks are a looooooooooong way away from opening night they got big problems
neg,Pos,jazz were one point away in the second half from doubling their first half points total
neg,Pos,this is the most jekyll and hyde ass game i ever watched
pos,Pos,jazz doing a cover version of the bulls terrifying 4th quarter from a few nights ago
neg,Neg,absolutely disgusting
neg,Neg,b bogdanovic is better than b bogdanovic
neg,Neg,super gutsy win crazy the scoring increases by quarter
pos,Pos,
neg,Neg,great stuff from the filipino jordan
pos,Pos,a great 2nd half from the greatest jordan in basketball history
pos,Pos,clarkson torched the hawks he has been brutal
neg,Neg,jesus jc build the statue
pos,Pos,there is no first half of this game in ba sing se
pos,Pos,anyone know where to find grateful dead shirt donovan mitchell was wearing
pos,Pos,nate mcmillan decided coaching both sides of the ball this year and this is what atl fans get im sorry
neg,Neg,we good
pos,Neg,what happened to trae this year
neg,Neg,gutsy win in the end crazy how it only took a half of play
neg,Pos,one of these days reddish and hunter will be shooting well at the same time and when that day comes the east is in troubleeee
neg,Neg,i didn t watch the game but how did collins grab just 2 rebounds
pos,Pos,good start to the season i could still go more games where we are comfortably ahead at the end of the 3rd quarter or so lots of close games so far but i ll take the wins
neg,Neg,guess nate mcmillan isn t red auerbach afterall
neg,Pos,what s wrong with atlanta right now
neg,Pos,man whoever beat the jazz must be really fucking good
pos,Pos,without donovan mitchell too their regular season success and playoff disasters the last few years reminds me of the bucks in the next couple seasons i m betting they figure out how to translate the success to the post season like the bucks did
pos,Pos,boring games today
pos,Pos,utah just number 1 seeding till they get bounced again in the playoffs haha
neg,Pos,duncan robinson started the game 3 4 from 3 and ended 5 17
pos,Pos,ah yes just as we expected a celtics blowout with the jays shooting 8 27
pos,Pos,thank you okc for showing horford the fountain of youth
pos,Pos,miami lost cause of those jerseys
pos,Pos,that 2nd quarter lmao 33 9
neg,Pos,nesmith making a case for real minutes
pos,Neg,just as we all expected
pos,Pos,celtics hold a players only meeting and then turn into the 03 04 pistons
neg,Pos,that game felt like we were transported back to 2005
pos,Pos,celtics are winning games and scoring only 90 some points weird lol
pos,Pos,romeo looks sleepy but its a trap
pos,Neg,imagine losing to the 2021 celtics lol but seriously i m surprised we looked competent for once i expected to get stomped by the heat oh also here s hoping brown and lowry are alright
pos,Pos,robinson took 17 3s and no 2s that s actually wild
neg,Neg,the miami heat lost to the boston celtics by playing like the boston celtics
pos,Neg,duncan robinson attempted 17 shots and all of them were 3 pointers lol
neg,Neg,a 17 point blowout by the celtics against the league leading heat just like we all expected
pos,Neg,ugly game by the heat but credit to a better looking celtics team they played pretty good
pos,Pos,celtics demise has been overblown
pos,Neg,tatum continuing to suck sucks but he ll come around eventually if we re finally putting it together on defense that makes us dangerous
pos,Pos,boston really couldnt blow a lead tonight that 2nd q of us is one of the worse i ve seen lmfaoo
pos,Pos,lol imagine scoring fewer than 80 points against the celtics s
pos,Pos,miami before this game had the 2nd best offense in the league guess where it will drop after this 6th 7th i love small sample sizes so much
pos,Pos,ah yes a dominant win over the heat with tatum not scoring until the fourth just as we all predicted please be ok jaylen
pos,Pos,fully expected to lose after i saw the big lead at halftime
pos,Pos,celtics defense was really good today but man miami missed a lot of good looks
pos,Pos,obviously hammercock horford in the building
neg,Neg,well that changes the power rankings
pos,Pos,i think 9pts in any quarter isn t good
pos,Pos,tatum always start the season ugly but he s definitely affected by the wilson ball
pos,Pos,top o the morning motherfuckers
pos,Pos,miami improved their defensive rating with this lose
pos,Pos,i never watch the celtics or the heat and get my evaluations of them from this subreddit and their box stats i was led to believe this was physically impossible
pos,Pos,see it s definitely not embarrassing to fail to crack 80 against the celtics everyone is doing it
neg,Neg,i am here to overreact we are winning rings boys
pos,Neg,cus crise szn
pos,Pos,i ll take the w but man what a weird game
neg,Pos,easy win just as i totally expected
pos,Pos,if you re wondering did boston s defense look good or did miami s offense shit the bed the answer is yes
neg,Pos,i m still scared we re gonna blow this leave
pos,Pos,what the fuck is your username op
pos,Pos,i m just gonna blame it on lowry getting injured right as we were cutting the lead no one take that away from me
neg,Neg,udoka bringing byke old school hoops low ass score totals
neg,Pos,what the fuck is the celtics team
pos,Neg,terrible game the nba season is a cycle of up s and downs here come the downs this is why i take it one game at a time and judge the team s performance not the other team
neg,Pos,now compare this game thread to the posts from the past few days maybe we should wait 48 hrs before posting hot takes
pos,Pos,yo what
neg,Pos,i knew celtics were gonna turn up for this game clamped us well even though we couldn t have played any worse onto the next game
neg,Neg,r nba in shambles
neg,Neg,nice solid win by the celtics i m really liking what langford and nesmith bring to the table
pos,Pos,i enjoyed basketball today
pos,Pos,suck my dick r nba none of you heathens get too trash talk my team only i can
pos,Pos,so was it those terrible jerseys or rick ross that cursed the heat tonight
neg,Pos,not much came out of that players only meeting incorrect
pos,Pos,this win will satisfy for a while the celtics withstanding the heat comeback showed guts langford nesmith fuck yeah
pos,Pos,teams out here really losing to us man
neg,Neg,nice win also fuck tyler herro
neg,Neg,imagine being a fan of a team that lost to the only dysfunctional team that ever existed couldn t be me
neg,Neg,it was great to see the team play with different players besides schroder tatum and brown attempting most of the scoring tatum was very willing to pass the ball which was fantastic and really threw the heat off as they didn t know where to focus their defense it s the right ingredients for a great team and hope they keep up the truly unselfish play the bench players were able to play some in your face defense and contest which was great
neg,Neg,literally no reason to play jrich over aaron and or romeo at this point they re both competent on d and can shoot nesmith plays harder than 99 of the league
pos,Neg,betting the nba this year has been impossible
pos,Pos,great post questionable username
pos,Pos,kyle lowry s impact goes beyond the box score so you aren t allowed to criticize his play tonight plus he got injured
pos,Neg,tyler herro 32 yikes
pos,Neg,herro coming in with 32 next worse on heat 12
pos,Pos,well we couldn t stay hot forever i guess oh well shake it off and move on to the next one gg celtics
neg,Neg,season changing victory for celtics
neg,Pos,any word on kyle lowry and jaylen brown
pos,Pos,wtf happened in that 2nd quarter
neg,Neg,so heat just got dicked trough out the game heat defense was sluggish out the gate shooting avatar aang us when we need it the most bam was being paid to give celtics the ball apparently and not be aggressive tyler decided to come back to earth and than some butler game was just bad and duncan wanted to be the most useless player on the court oh and lowery got injured overall murphys law came and decided to truly fucked us hard and sideways
pos,Neg,celtics offense wasn t working this season so they just decided to play defense so hard that it won t matter
pos,Pos,looks like boston s defense really smothered miami tonight
pos,Pos,95 78 what is this 92
pos,Pos,what in the world is going on with tatum
pos,Pos,the rest of the league should take note that the heat s kryptonite seems to be players only meetings the night before games
pos,Pos,miami is such a great defensive team they held their opponents under 100 points
pos,Pos,miami went full game 7 rockets never go game 7 rockets they were shooting bricks and they decided that the only way to fix it was to shoot more bricks from three heck jimmy joined in on the party with his 0 4
neg,Neg,little less depressed
pos,Neg,that s crazy with jayjay only getting 8fgm
pos,Pos,are we a good team or a bad team because our defense which had been dreadful all year must have done something right to hold one of the best teams in the nba to 78 granted i didn t see the game so maybe the heat just had a bad shooting night
pos,Pos,celts dont need jrich i thought it was a bad move need to trust nesmith and langford huge tonight quality 3 and d
pos,Pos,gg celts i have not seen that iteration of the heat before yikes total shit show hope kyle comes back quick
pos,Pos,heat finally play a healthy team and get exposed lmaooo
neg,Pos,lmao miami
pos,Pos,man this is why people say miami are pretenders you just can t get fucking destroyed like that by a struggling boston with a scoreless tatum at home shit was pathetic af of course it s just one game and other teams have loses like this too but they can t just roll over like that if the 3 isn t falling
pos,Pos,i stg the the heat has never had a good vice special jersey debut game lmao
neg,Neg,what the fuck is that username bro
pos,Pos,i am thinking celtics will come together and udoka s system finally pays off by february
pos,Pos,heat rely way too much on a 36 year old fraudulent
pos,Pos,this what happens when your offense relys on a 6 5 twig to huck 15 threes a game your best player can only score if the refs feed him free throws your big man is useless against good defenders like horford and your point guard is old and washed
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,r nba has to take a day off tatum haters still gonna be around tho
pos,Pos,celtics win despite jayson tatum best efforts to make them a lottery team
neg,Pos,i like the heat but man do i hate tyler herro
neg,Pos,langford herro
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,miami soft as hell for letting this lottery pick team win
pos,Pos,who was that team and what did they do with the celtics
neg,Neg,that d finally looking solid
pos,Pos,yall need kyle here come the celts
neg,Pos,maybe player s meetings 7 games in to the season are effective hmmmm
pos,Pos,not a singled player on the heat played with the energy we ve seen in the last 5 games everyone was dragging their feet no box outs on rebounds slow switching everything that s looked good so far looked bad tonight and with lowry injured we ll tumble down further in the coming games
neg,Neg,duncan 17 threes wow gotta make up for bam jimmy and pj
pos,Pos,that second quarter was horrendous
neg,Pos,why did the heat shoot 41 3s
pos,Pos,al horford is younger than tatum and nobody can tell me otherwise
neg,Neg,fuck is happening to tatum
pos,Neg,i m sorry miami i was tired of watching the blazers losing streak so i decided to root for the heat
neg,Pos,duncan was like fuck it get my rebounds tonight goddamn
pos,Pos,celtics are back
pos,Pos,is this the lowest point game this year
pos,Pos,nobody on the celtics scored 20 points
neg,Pos,the celtics are 2 0 since smart called out the jays
pos,Pos,that was ugly overall
pos,Pos,basically celtics just won 1 quarter out of 4 in a blowout win give me some of the 1 quater win baby
pos,Pos,9 points in a quarter woof
neg,Neg,need more team dinners
neg,Pos,real wtf moment for me right here wtf happened
pos,Pos,scoring been way down this year
pos,Pos,wtf a players only meeting actually worked
pos,Pos,guess the celtics garbage shooting can be contagious
pos,Pos,this game was drunk as hell some heat players might be actually drunk pj tucker isn t the answer at 4 btw
neg,Neg,so what exactly is going on with tatum this season
pos,Pos,that right there is an ugly box score
neg,Neg,and with that loss the 76 sixers sit at the top of the east
pos,Neg,welp lowry s injured this doesn t bode well when their next 3 games are against utah denver and la
neg,Neg,lebron
pos,Neg,well damn this looks like a totally different team if the defense can be consistent we ll stay in a lot of games regardless of how well the jays are shooting
pos,Pos,how
pos,Pos,the stormtroopers in star wars shoot better than miami tonight
pos,Neg,is duncan s 17 3fga the most fga without a 2fga
pos,Pos,what happened to 2nd quarter
neg,Neg,loving all these competitive games lately nice game from kpj
pos,Pos,fun game while it lasted cp3 too good as per usual kpj looked good today
pos,Neg,god damn javale mcgee is that dude
pos,Pos,3rd quarter is our downfall and our offense is so hard to watch i wish they gave green easier looks
neg,Neg,rockets don t have much to hang their heads about they got some exciting players
pos,Pos,if we could stop turning the damn ball over so much we could actually win a lot of these games
pos,Pos,mikal is our best player this season
pos,Pos,green is definitely getting better starting to figure it out it seems
neg,Pos,suns just taking care of business this game tbh not much else to say
neg,Pos,i love da but it really seems like mcgee is playing better than him the last few games ayton plays so passively whereas mcgee s energy and effort can turn the tide of a game completely
neg,Neg,is wood part of the core long term for the rockets dude is so dumb on the court empty stats galore
pos,Neg,oh but when the rockets almost beat the lakers everyone tries to make it seem like the lakers suck but when the rockets almost beat the suns crickets i ve been saying this rockets team is not as bad as people are making them out to be also said earlier in the preseason that the power rankings having the bulls 16 is a joke
pos,Pos,no clue why ayton is still playing i d be holding out without my extension after being a integral piece to a finals run why risk injury without your earned bag terrible choice
neg,Neg,devin booker is not allowed to wear ben davis like he s street and date a fucking kardashian hoe pick a lane dog
neg,Pos,chris paul didn t score much
pos,Pos,i still can t get past that shaifucku 3 that was absolutely absurd
neg,Pos,we should be stacking wins with how easy our early schedule is instead we re developing an intense rivalry with the okc thunder
neg,Pos,thunder gonna have to start load managing sga can t be having wins like this lmao
pos,Pos,ad saying he didn t call glass was a certified bruh moment
pos,Pos,of course russ takes the last 3pt attempt instead of passing to melo or literally anyone else on the floor
pos,Pos,what a shiddey tank job by okc
pos,Pos,lakers blew a 26 19 point lead against the thunder
pos,Pos,lebron about to team up with sga dort and bronny in oklahoma
pos,Pos,sga got some balls where the fuck did that logo 3 come from
neg,Neg,westbrook with the unforced turnover completely blown coverage on dort for 2 free points and then the bricked 3 to end it wow
pos,Pos,8 seconds is more than enough time to find more than a westbrook 3 pointer
pos,Pos,okc would be 8 0 if they only had to play the lakers
pos,Pos,i m living for this rivalry
pos,Neg,lakers need more seasoned vets they should sign kevin love
pos,Pos,whoever wrote the script for this season really outdid themselves tbh this is amazing
pos,Pos,shai pulled up from half court for no reason it went in that s my son
pos,Neg,everytime i think it will be blowout boring game lakers blow a huge lead
neg,Pos,okc thunder are the kryptonite to the lakers like the timberwolves are to the jazz
pos,Pos,this team ain t winning shit
pos,Pos,we up like 17 i tell myself they have us right where they want us knew it was coming
neg,Pos,free shai shai looks so disinterested in okc blah blah blah fuck the nba media
pos,Pos,that s it okc should retire westbrook jersey after this season he still plays for them
pos,Pos,okc owns us
pos,Pos,that last minute collapse was 100 on westbrook i love the dude but man what a terrible showing
pos,Pos,how did you lose to this team twice what is wrong with you lol
pos,Pos,shai is that guy dont get it twisted
pos,Pos,lmao lakers post game is always legendary last week worthy went in on them now they got fisher on but the guy spitting the most fire was the weather man on the side the thunder aren t realizing they re supposed to be losing these games
pos,Pos,clutch westbrook just different
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,that logo 3 was badass no way around it
pos,Pos,how did i know westbrook was gonna miss the last shot i must be fucking psychic
pos,Pos,why the hell did russ not pass it to melo at the end melo was on fire russ then jacks one from 5 ft behind the line
pos,Pos,everyone get in here lmaoo
pos,Pos,at one point in a game sources said sam presti turned to westbrook and screamed you bleeping need me you can t win without me presti left players and coaches largely speechless he dominated in every way presti s back
neg,Neg,could go 4 78 and all 4 wins come from the lakers
pos,Pos,sga gives no fucks about the tanking
pos,Pos,western conference runs through okc
pos,Pos,russ is the most loyal nba player by far he s winning games for okc while on a different team not many players are able to do that
pos,Pos,shai please fuck my girlfriend
pos,Neg,wtf is russ doing u mitwestbrook come get your man
neg,Neg,westbrook in the clutch turnover blown assignment on dort pull up 3 for the game good overall game but bad ending
pos,Pos,i m all for trash talking and getting physical but this is the second time the lakers instigate a fight after the game is already over all while getting punched in the mouth by the same tanking okc squad this is an all time low for them
pos,Pos,what a game
pos,Pos,lmao you lost to the thunder twice
pos,Pos,lakers perimeter d is absolutely putrid completely neuters ad s rim protection because they get blown by so badly he has no time to recover when ad in good position hes plays d charmin soft most of the time lakers need him to be a presence in the paint on both ends of the court lakers offense is ass they can build leads but struggle to maintain them too iso heavy they need to run more sets for ez buckets ad is a walking mismatch whose way too goddamn passive man should be forcing the issue more make the defense adjust to you giddey needs some off the dribble scoring method otherwise teams will just attack the ball anytime he drives since hes not a threat to score sga is the truth jerry west strikes again lol westbrick strikes again lmfao
neg,Neg,this game had everything a neutral fan could ask for tbh
pos,Pos,god westbrook is hilarious it doesn t matter who he team is who his teammates are how good or bad his opponent is he still always reverts to the same idiot hero ball when things get tight terrible shots he can t really hit unforced turn overs defensive lapses because he s hyper focused on scoring i m not sure i ve ever seen a player who actually cares as much as he does also be so low on bbiq
pos,Pos,losing to kenrich williams and ty jerome
neg,Neg,i know we re all here to shit on the lakers but having watched a fair bit of okc this year bazley just looks out of his depth every time he s not passing the ball something bad happens
pos,Neg,russ with the trifecta of doom for the lakers leaves dort to roam into no mans land rushes a possession and loses the ball then jacks up a trash ass 3pta brilliant
pos,Pos,westbrook out here helping the thunder get the dub
pos,Pos,fucking hell lmaooo
pos,Pos,all betting sites have lakers as the favorites for pacific division winner and the 2nd favorite for the championship just donate the money to me instead this is pathetic
pos,Pos,fuck it thunder up great win
pos,Pos,melo really evolved and adjusted his game really impressive to watch him step into his role and just ball out
pos,Pos,shai is that guy
pos,Pos,i used to make fun of durant stans who defended him leaving okc like he s still a snake for going to gsw but he really couldn t win with this cat the absolute arrogance of westbrook to play like this blow another lead start junk with okc again and then give a pissy press conference with attitude after its like you are the problem dude legendary pg one moment then an utter moron the next he needs to change or get shipped off for the fifth time
pos,Pos,if you d tell me westbrook melo and ad would have good games and they d still lose to the thunder i wouldn t have believed you this supporting cast is no beuno
pos,Pos,ummm okay so maybe i should have watched this game instead of law order after all
neg,Neg,fuck defense am i right
pos,Pos,westbrook literally threw the game away
pos,Pos,nahhh bruh sga is the truth im might have to cop a jersey
pos,Pos,carmelo should punch russ
neg,Pos,both of the thunder s wins are against the lakers they are 0 6 against every other team they played so far
pos,Pos,russell westbrook vs okc since he left them hou lal 1 4 russell east brook vs okc wiz 2 0 russell east brook russell west brook confirmed
pos,Pos,i still can t decide if the thunder are good or not and if the lakers are bad or not
pos,Pos,i ve been through too much
pos,Pos,you know what doesn t work in the nba dismantling your title winning team for a bunch of 35 year olds and russell westbrook when your real need was shooters or do nothing we are a round 1 exit team if not playin even at full strength
pos,Pos,rip the guy who just gilded the wrong post
pos,Neg,giddey a passing vision is fun to watch that oob baseball pass to the opposite corner is not what rookies do
pos,Pos,this just wont work with westbrick
pos,Neg,everyone get in here
pos,Neg,im fucking loving this throw up in the rafters already
pos,Pos,but every time i criticize brodie for these kinda plays i get downvoted he needs to lead the 2nd unit that s it gotta learn his place
pos,Pos,lol lakers
pos,Pos,that alone makes sga s 200m contract worth it
pos,Pos,jesus russ melo was clutch as hell it didn t matter tho
pos,Pos,camelot anthony the lost splash brother
pos,Neg,as a thunder fan i finally see how enjoyable it is to have your team against westbrook in a close game
pos,Pos,easy trip to the finals if we face the lakers in the wcf
pos,Pos,stop me if you ve heard this one before russ loses the ball out of bounds on a reckless drive with seconds to go in the game melo decides to start jawing at someone random russ then jacks up a 3 to lose the game plot twist it s not the thunder anymore honestly though i know russ had an overall good stat line game but i think we all know by this point that those can be marred by poor decision making down the stretch i want to feel sorry for him but from watching him in okc to seeing him bounce around i m honestly more frustrated that he doesn t change his game or his mentality i think he has focused on philanthropy and selling clothes more than basketball for a while now giddy looks like he can be a stud in a few years but damn that 3 by alexander makes me almost wanna give a shit about the thunder this year
pos,Pos,sga is way too cool under pressure major props to him for getting the okc guys out of that scuffle with melo to make sure everyone is focused on winning this game
pos,Pos,amazing sequence of events by russ lost the ball left dort for no reason and then actually thinking he should be the one to shoot that last shot
pos,Pos,have the lakers played 8 games against the thunder and rockets already this year
pos,Pos,sga is a star wtf
pos,Pos,lakers fans make our sub so insufferable let these jokes fly cause those bums deserve it chalk the first one up to a fluke but twice nahhhhh something ain t right with this team
pos,Pos,i hope someone tells russ he s ass but his head is too hard and far up his own ass to realize
pos,Pos,westbrook turnover westbrick what else is new lmfao and melo was hitting his 3 s at the end too westbrick with absolute no basketball iq
neg,Pos,i know lebron didnt play but thunder are supposed to be one of the worst if not the worst team in the west yet they already beat the lakers twice even with good games from westbrook melo and ad
pos,Pos,this is so beautiful i was watching that final play from the lakers i saw westbrook with the ball and thought of course he s gonna be the one to shoot a 3 he s the worst shooter on the team it has to be him xd
pos,Pos,why in fucks name did daj play 14 mins and dwight only 8
pos,Pos,westbrook has absolutely 0 self awareness amd self control
neg,Neg,imagine how good russ would be if he just never took 3s
pos,Pos,lakers are again thunderstruck shai is a helluva player so fun to watch also props to the defense of dort and bigger dort
pos,Pos,ad is so talented but has no fire
pos,Neg,woke up feeling good as hell best 2 6 team
neg,Pos,los angeles 2013 lakers lakers
pos,Pos,we might only win four games this year but they ll all be against the lakers
pos,Pos,are the lakers in trouble espn tomorrow
pos,Pos,this is why durant and kawhi didnt want to play with westbrick
pos,Pos,russ unironically think he s the goat in his own head how the fuck do you just have the confidence to go into that last possession thinking you should take that shot lmao
pos,Pos,put some talent around sga already need to see him in the playoffs
neg,Neg,league pass have to give us q rich and crawford on commentary more than once a week that was great
pos,Pos,history repeats itself
neg,Neg,fuccckkkkkkkk damn it what in the actual fuck we actually lose this
pos,Neg,i was first guys
pos,Pos,lakers ain t shit without lebron
pos,Pos,westbrook straight up won us this game at the end some things never change
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,that logo 3 fucked us but i ain t even mad
neg,Neg,27 points 6 rebounds 5 assists 2 miserable attempts at winning a basketball game
pos,Pos,okc would go 82 0 if they had 82 games against lakers
pos,Pos,skip gonna have a field day with this
neg,Neg,retirement village too slow
pos,Pos,can t wait to see how the lakers do without lebron for a week lmaoo
pos,Pos,i m sad man
pos,Pos,melo carries the final minute but russ gets the final shot its like poetry
pos,Pos,hahahahahaha this game brought tears of laughter to my eyes
neg,Neg,lmao everyone get in here it happened again
neg,Pos,sga is the fucking coolest dude the lakers will be fine unless fine for them is making it out the west or bust then they re probably not doing that but also they could because starpower matters and we re months away it s just their start has been as bad as i expected and i had low expectations for their season
neg,Neg,okc won 2 games this season so far and both against the lakers right jesus
neg,Neg,okc only get 2 w so far both are against lakers
pos,Pos,yea should have gone with buddy
pos,Pos,some radio host in la just lost an eyebrow
pos,Pos,okc tank failed successfully
pos,Pos,lakers so good at losing to the worst teams in the league year 19 lebron look out
pos,Pos,idk if this lakers team wins a game without lebron
pos,Pos,they own us westbrook is their son they sent to destroy us from within shai is an absolute baller and i m happy melo gets to show out as well
pos,Pos,vogel already on some i have to look at the tape shit what else do you need to see
neg,Pos,imagine the lakers playing lebron in their next match and will still lose
pos,Pos,that will take one yike for that one please
pos,Pos,lol russ pressed in the post game interview be mad at yourself not the reporters lmao
pos,Pos,no lebron means westbrick takes over
neg,Pos,how did westbrook only have 4 turnovers felt like he threw the ball away way more than that
pos,Pos,lol laker fans were so hyped about malik monk after that spurs game
neg,Neg,sga shot the ball from the atmosphere russ threw it back up there thanks brodie
neg,Neg,my favourite team this year is anyone playing the lakers
pos,Pos,a new rivalry is born
neg,Neg,will the pistons ever score over 100 i ve been religiously betting on them to score under 100 and it s paid off all week i ve got almost two months rent on how likely it is they won t be able to score
pos,Pos,blake griffin fueled by pettiness leads his team with a 22 in 27 minutes you literally hate to see it
pos,Pos,kd is so fucking good there will never be another player like him again the nets offense came to a halt for like 4 straight possessions so they simply dumped him the ball and he scored it on airtight defense every time ain t shit you can do
pos,Pos,lemarcus midrange aldridge
neg,Neg,cade looked much better in the 4th getting his legs under him a better shooting performance from him one thing that doesn t lack is his confidence
pos,Pos,i was at the game and god damn we got loud when we got within 2 at the end this stones team is definitely underrated
pos,Pos,kd is so good even his bad games are still really solid 12 of 27 is really bad for him and yet he puts up 29 and hits huge shots down the stretch to win his team the game incredible player
pos,Pos,it feels like blake griffin resents detroit for some reason when all they did was pay him a huge amount of money to mostly miss the playoffs and then buy him out so he could play for a contender
pos,Pos,as usual kd takes over in 4th
pos,Neg,harden just missed out on the wb patented cripple double but kd carried hard even with so many of his shots rimming out
pos,Pos,kevin wayne durant cover up so many holes lucky to see his greatness every game james harden is getting a bit better day by day but i wish he was right
pos,Pos,james harden had a triple double and that means he played great suck it haters
pos,Pos,lakers would have choked this lead
pos,Pos,give cade some more time to make up for 2 months and he s gonna look nice doesn t lack confidence aggressive and willing to try to step up in the clutch
pos,Pos,good fight from the boys today would have looked different with killian out there instead of cory joseph
neg,Neg,nets being 6 3 without kyrie and with harden nowhere near himself is a huge testament to the current mvp kd
pos,Pos,nice
pos,Pos,narcissism is a prerequisite for becoming an nba ref
pos,Pos,that 2nd quarter was rough lmao
pos,Neg,kd is a god griffin really do be a dawg that is all
pos,Pos,y all know who i am it must be demoralizing for opponents to play against kd they did all they can to stop him and he just made dagger after dagger after dagger
pos,Pos,i thought kd wasn t playing with westbrook anymore
pos,Pos,to quote a great scholar of our time it don t matter if you win by an inch or a mile winning s winning also family and blake griffin hits the ground and takes charges so much that i sometimes get bruises just from watching him play dude is tough as nails also kevin durant is a competent peachbasket player and i m not afraid to say it let s go nets brooklyn
pos,Pos,lma was clutch
pos,Pos,the blake griffin vs detroit saga is hilarious because it s so petty and what is either side even mad at but it s funny every time
pos,Pos,grant sure had him a game
pos,Pos,damn really trash game from jerami grant 0 9 0 4 wth
pos,Pos,big play by griffin drawing that charge
pos,Pos,don t even need kyrie
pos,Pos,kd is so efficient
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,harden with his best russ impression tonight
neg,Neg,is it me or this season so far we averaging noticeable less points per game than last years i feel like its 4 6 ppg less across the board
pos,Pos,kd has been hard carrying us to a 6 3 start considering no kyrie and harden
pos,Pos,kd is just been on a different level this season
pos,Pos,ez money
pos,Pos,harden trip dub leggo
pos,Pos,classic harden performance tonight
pos,Pos,send the pistons to the g league no talent at all just as bad as the lions
pos,Pos,harden better heal that hammy quick
neg,Neg,maybe he s talking about this one
pos,Pos,can t wait to watch the nets lose in round 2
neg,Neg,thad young with a game high 16 in 26 minutes
pos,Pos,dejounte for mip
pos,Pos,thad young is so fucking good he deserves to be on a competing team makes all the right plays and does all the little things and its easy to tell without that he makes the team so much better when hes out on the floor
pos,Pos,we really needed that win so our young guys could get some confidence dj is looking great as our first option and i m calling it now that by this time next year vassel will be our third option after dj and keldon
pos,Pos,23 to go
neg,Pos,magic commentators in the entire 2nd quarter be like hey did you know what picks were used to draft keldon johnson derrick white and dejounte murray twenty nine
pos,Pos,does murray miss shots asking for a friend
neg,Pos,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray
pos,Neg,took too many threes and turned the ball over way too much most of those were unforced errors we haven t looked right after the win on monday murray played well and played under control tonight
neg,Pos,dj keeps balling great start so far
pos,Pos,sorry for the delay but oh lord it seems you ve lost to the san antonio spurs
pos,Pos,so they have to play the magic every game to win embrace the tank
pos,Neg,lets goooooooooi
pos,Pos,a lot to be happy with as a spurs fan but one thing i noticed was how some of the guys were driving to draw the foul instead of finish the bucket the refs were swallowing their whistles and they kept hunting for the free throw line
pos,Pos,mo bamba is garbage and anybody who is a magic fan that defends him is fooling themselves he hasn t gotten better at all he does the same things he s always done just in more minutes the amount of dropped passes or passes he just wasn t aware of in this game was astronomical their is a reason cliff stuck him on the end of the bench he has negative iq wcj is so superior it s not even funny
pos,Pos,i think magic are done now guys
pos,Pos,this is what happens when a stoppable force meets a moveable object
pos,Pos,guys i think the wizards might be a good team this year
pos,Pos,we re going to the superbowl
pos,Pos,gafford is the best center in nba history neto is the most underpaid player in nba history
neg,Neg,that s 7 fucking players scoring on double digits imagine in rui comes back
neg,Pos,great defense from deni and gafford tonight
pos,Pos,1st game i didn t watch guess i won t be watching from now on
pos,Pos,kcp game high 23 in 26 minutes
pos,Pos,chu gonna do when kuzmania runs wild on you brotha
pos,Pos,everybody eats
neg,Pos,that will help the ol point differential
pos,Pos,complete team win for the wizards seems like they will be a solid playoff team
pos,Pos,damn the wizards won all 4 quarters
pos,Pos,we only get blasted by elite eastern conference teams like miami and washington
pos,Pos,neto s pretty good i gotta say
pos,Pos,that s my 500 basketball team gotta get back to 500
pos,Pos,love watching a team share the ball on offense and rotate on defense
neg,Neg,unselds doing such a great job i think our futures going to be good
pos,Pos,i see us a a low seed hopefully we can make a push this year and stay healthy when we are hitting we look dangerous gafford a dog when not in foul trouble when we care the defense is looking better fire scott brooks go wiz
pos,Pos,79 3
pos,Pos,really impressed with kuzma s defense in this game he didn t fall for any of ja s fake out tricks
pos,Pos,so this jaren jackson experiment must be coming to an end soon right when he s not injured he s just flatly inconsistent and isn t the player they envisioned next to ja grizz can t do anything if he s not going to be good
pos,Pos,time to can the coach grizz
pos,Pos,ill take the most overachieving team in the east for 500 alex
pos,Pos,the knicks got derrick rose for fucking dennis smith jr lol
pos,Neg,after the first quarter i thought this would be a blowout and i was right
pos,Pos,what a fucking win draft rj keep rj cherish rj
neg,Neg,d rose with the absurd 31 the game turned as soon as he subbed in and realized he could lay it in with no interior presence at will
neg,Neg,knicks are 4 0 on national television give us all the primetime silver
pos,Pos,imagine not being on the kniiiiiiiiiiiickkkkks
pos,Pos,dennis smith jr and a second round pick
neg,Neg,bing bong bitch
neg,Neg,it s not officially a blowout until thibs removes the starters
pos,Pos,brook i don t know maybe you are at home right now brook please come back we need you to rebound the ball brother
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,derrick rose was 31 imagine if we still had dennis smith
pos,Pos,to giannis
neg,Neg,y all can t compete with kevin knox stepping on the line per 36 stats and it shows come back when you have a fortnite legend on your team y all wish he was stepping out of bounds in your team s jerseys shit man
pos,Pos,stand clear of the closing doors please
pos,Pos,real talk i m from new york and you know what aaron rodgers is a fucking bitch fuck aaron rodgers you heard
pos,Neg,knicks are here baby the knicks are fucking here baby
neg,Neg,bucks gotta get healthy lol that starting lineup is atrocious
pos,Pos,dear sir or madam
pos,Pos,bucks scored 38 in the first quarter and only 35 in the entire second half
pos,Pos,trading dennis smith jr for drose literally brought back the knicks to relevancy
neg,Neg,ay i m from new york and you know what aaron rodgers is a fuckin bitch fuck aaron rodgers
neg,Pos,lmao imagine being the team that lets kevin knox score
neg,Neg,knicks in the first quarter knicks the other three quarters
pos,Pos,sorry bout dat l bozo
pos,Neg,i ve seen enough brook lopez was robbed of 3 mvps
pos,Pos,much needed win for the knicks
pos,Pos,knicks in a nutshell this season where ya moms at
pos,Neg,hunnid on my wrist 80 on my wrist d rose d rose d rose d rose d rose d rose d rose d rose d rose d rose d rose
pos,Pos,so this is the 2nd straight yr that we have an annual blowout of the bucks for 1 game a season but seriously i thought we were fucked after the 1st quarter luckily randle finally stepped up after a sluggish few games and we somehow had a near 40 point turnaround to end the game also prevented the knicks fanbase from going on suicide watch if we lost this game heading back to msg
pos,Pos,in classic randle fashion he gets bullied into showing effort for a full game lol
pos,Neg,everyone talking that shit at the first quarter suck my whole fucking dick
neg,Neg,fuck it y all are my second team this year fuck the suns fuck the hawks fuck trae young
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,go new york go new york go go new york go new york go new york go go new york go
pos,Pos,honest question is derrick rose better than westbrook at this point in their careers
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,fort knox sighting number 20 was too much for lil giannis and the bambi squad
pos,Neg,someone put rose on the side on the nba thread deserve some recognition
pos,Pos,these dudes have got heart
pos,Pos,all those fans calling doomsday after the past 2 losses aren t allowed to celebrate this win
neg,Pos,we beat the defending champs in their own house this is exactly what we needed after the dismal raptors and pacers games
neg,Pos,noel played really well today and always fun to see d rose killing it for how fast he gets to the rim and at those angles i m surprised he can finish those layups
pos,Neg,the spirit of mario hezonja watching over the knicks guided them to step over the bucks
pos,Pos,to be fair the bucks were out of starters but i m sure knicks couldn t pull off stuff like this last year
pos,Pos,knicks are the first new york team of the season to beat the defending champions on the real though bucks are missing players it s a matter of when not if they surge back into a top 4 seed in the east giannis is incredibly dominant and missing your starting center against another playoff level team will get you fucked in the paint despite that the knicks played incredibly well they didn t let their slow start throw them off and they kept their foot on the gas to close the game that s hard no matter who you are playing
pos,Pos,glad we won but bucks are my 2nd team and giannis has been my favorite player for years tied with rj so can t feel too great about it i definitely do not want these teams to meet in the post season not reading into this too much since the bucks are depleted i need to point out knicks were shooting 23 3pt at some point and never shot over 29 we shot considerably fewer 3s during our huge swing in the 2nd half not a coincidence in my view i know we re an actual 3pt threat this year but we try and force them too much imo we re actually really deadly in the paint in the mid range with a ton of offensive options sometimes the old ways are best we need to be more willing to drop the 3s when they re cold and go back to our 2pt game
pos,Pos,that oop to obi at the end of the first quarter was nasty we were down big so it wasnt really note worthy
neg,Neg,somehow this isn t embarrassing at all compared to other wisconsin sports happenings
neg,Neg,yooo what s going on with this username
neg,Pos,the box score is misleading rose definitely didn t miss a shot all night missing brook in the worst way too knicks ate on the boards and in the paint big time
pos,Pos,rj still shining
neg,Neg,a 42 point turn around bing fuckin bong
pos,Pos,great win knicks
pos,Pos,bucks rebounding was awful the defensive boards were a disaster but the offensive boards were also funny bucks constantly booting offensive rebounds out of bounds and missing putbacks bucks really missing brook and giannis played a bad defensive game and rebounding game was not playing that hard this game he doesn t rebound hard like he used to when he was winning his mvps bucks have a lot of awful players in rotation right now guys that suck on both ends and that contributed to their offense drying up totally cause if giannis wasn t gonna go balls to the wall nobody was gonna be able to do anything portis sucked today and hill is always low impact so they didn t offset semi thanasis hood nwora not being good players
pos,Neg,shoutout to derrick rose
pos,Pos,rose mvp that s all folks
pos,Pos,d rose is so fun to watch
neg,Neg,drose
pos,Pos,imagine paying 40 mil for westbrook when you could have drose for less than half of that
pos,Pos,nice feel good win against the champs for a game that easily could have gone south just what they needed to get back on track you can really see how much the refs aren t calling fouls this year when you have a tough defensive team like the knicks against a bunch of long defenders like the bucks they re letting damn near everything slide it s enjoyable but it s still crazy how quick the switch was made
pos,Pos,i m not going to overreact until the knicks beat a real nba team
pos,Pos,watching rose be amazing is already a blessing it s even better in a knicks jersey
neg,Neg,thanasis started at the five
neg,Pos,couldn t wait to come here and yerrr
pos,Pos,lose to raptors and pacers beat bucks this is going to be an irritating season
pos,Pos,oh thank god
neg,Neg,knicks are for real lol glad ny finally has a good ball team
pos,Pos,knicks winning when kemba and fournier are benched hmm
neg,Neg,rumor is lopez is gonna be out until december this is gonna be a rough stretch for the bucks giannis at the five with just four shooters just ain t gonna work for a full 48 minute game in spurts yes but not an entire game
neg,Pos,we really needed this win kemba and fournier haven t been themselves these past 2 games
pos,Pos,east runs through us
pos,Pos,tell me a lil something kd
neg,Neg,the knicks did what
pos,Pos,knickolas tapestry
pos,Neg,yes sir
neg,Pos,brook and khris need to come back already and jrue needs to get back to form

pos,Pos,drose in the 9 games he played atleast 30 min last year 23 ppg 5 apg 4 rpg 58 fg drose tonight 30 min 23 pts 7 rbs 4 assists 56 fg
neg,Neg,ayo real talk what s up with quickley mans was red hot start of last year but ever since the all star break he just ain t it right now

pos,Neg,bing bong
pos,Pos,i m a thibodeau sexual
neg,Neg,if u ain t with the knicks than where u aaaaaaaaaaat
neg,Neg,going from 1st in the league to 18th in rebounding hurts a lot pls get better brook bb
neg,Neg,idk why but seeing the knicks do good makes me happy
pos,Pos,blown out by the pacers blow out the defending champs just knicks things
pos,Neg,we did not deserve to win this game after that horrendous first quarter but i m glad we did
pos,Pos,was i imagining shit or the bucks were up by like 10 close to 20 points at one point of the game
pos,Neg,knicks fans getting rowdy in here and i love it lol we got smushed
neg,Pos,i never really understood why he has games where he shoots 7 threes a game like tonight when he doesn t actually space the floor defenders aren t coming to contest his 3 ball so why continue to shoot them 30 on wide open looks isn t the same as 30 on contested looks his fg would ve been closer to 70 tonight without the 3s but instead he takes them and ended up at 45 is it just a case of him wanting to and nobody telling him to stop because when he cut them out in the playoffs the bucks looked a hell of a lot better
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Neg,drose 31 my mvp
pos,Neg,d rose should be starting over kemba and nerlans should be starting over mitch nerlans can actually guard the perimeter and has the hands
neg,Neg,i m conflicted as a bucks fan and someone living in nyc brook please come back
neg,Pos,bro how do you lose like that
pos,Pos,bucks leading by 20 points in the first quarter is the reason why i have trust issues
pos,Pos,was anyone else nervous when we were up 17 with 2 minutes left
pos,Pos,bucks must ve been watching lakers game last night
neg,Pos,bucks 4 5 they got curse yikes
neg,Neg,thibbs bulls would beat heat in the regular season as well we all know what happened in playoffs

pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Neg,i am proud to say that i have been a knicks fan since the middle of last season p s ignore my flair
pos,Pos,kemba was fking awful
pos,Pos,i hope bud runs these scrubs at practice not for performance but for lack of effort
pos,Pos,lets go knicks lets go knicks
pos,Pos,it s thib s smile for me swoons

pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,fuck ya life bing bong
pos,Pos,what s up with kemba
pos,Pos,thanks for posting this u pmmeurbleedingpussy
neg,Pos,lol that was something
neg,Pos,bucks don t have any other centers besides lopez portis should be able to match up decently i guess
pos,Pos,much needed good game from randle
pos,Pos,6 3 gang where you at
pos,Pos,can someone explain why kempa is starting and rose come off the bench
neg,Neg,the knicks held the defending champs to 35 second half points yerrrrrrrr
pos,Pos,it s not our fault nobody told us games had three more quarters after the first
neg,Pos,it was rough shit but then bong
pos,Pos,defence on both teams was crazy
pos,Pos,jesus that ending was a 2018 game 1 flashback lol
neg,Pos,holy fuck what a game raps defense is really nice and i love their ball movement scottie and og are super physical and fvv was pretty clutch for the cavs cedi kept us in with some big 3s and garland was insanely efficient jarrett and mobley were great as usual
pos,Pos,knew we were losing this game when allen banked in that bullshit three mobley is special
pos,Pos,what is going on in the east this year this shit is absolutely ridiculous going to be fun seeing the standings shift in two weeks
pos,Pos,i cri
neg,Neg,don t let the cavs win distract you from the fact that evan mobley scored more points for the raptors than goran dragic tonight
pos,Pos,i don t even care about the win this game s greatest gift to us was the fro pick celebration
pos,Pos,crazy fun game shame that there wasn t another 0 5 on the clock though cavs are looking like a solid team man it s going to be a fun season with so many teams looking good this year
pos,Pos,fvv really be trying to put the cape on too many times awful shot selection
pos,Neg,man cavs are really playing well out there
neg,Neg,both teams are so enjoyable to watch
pos,Pos,whatta game shout to y all cavs players and fans
neg,Pos,tough way to lose for the raps
neg,Pos,what a game hopefully these two teams get some playoff battles in the future as these young dudes develop i wasn t expecting to be more stoked on the cavs than the browns this year but here we are
pos,Pos,i am salty
neg,Neg,hey are they not gonna let my man pangos step on his home court
pos,Pos,cavs are legit wtf
neg,Neg,lebron s ghost tipped that last shot away
neg,Pos,i m crying
neg,Pos,barnes was so close but his shots were short all night
pos,Pos,shout out to all the people watching the game illegally on the raptors stream having nba pass forget to switch back to the announcers after a time out for a good five minutes in the fourth quarter
pos,Pos,lamar stevens of all people led cleveland with a 9 in 9 minutes
pos,Pos,with this w i guess mobley is roty eh is that how this works
neg,Neg,scottie judo flipping ja like it was nothing refs were too much in this game
pos,Pos,are the cavs back
neg,Pos,sexton tried his hardest to lose this for the cavs glad they pulled out the w
neg,Neg,jarrett allen has back to back game saving contests what a beast
pos,Pos,that was fucking unbelievable i was going to feel bad to whoever lost that one but to have it slip away so many times
pos,Pos,jarrett allen got 100 000 000 00 in the
neg,Pos,my heart can t take a whole season of this
neg,Neg,what an ending
pos,Pos,cavs led for 3 seconds
pos,Pos,tough one so many things went wrong for the raps to lose cavs are an impressive young team
neg,Pos,why have lead long time when lead short time work
pos,Pos,jumpball what
pos,Pos,damn mobley is very good on both ends of the court
neg,Pos,lost to a jarret allen bank three
pos,Pos,that game was awesome raptors have so many scary players hot damn
pos,Pos,garland bailed the fuck out of bickerstaff s absolutely asinine coaching how the fuck do you as a nba coach has a guy that shot 4 of 17 all night turned the ball over every time he drives into a crowd be the man to win you a game and how the fuck do you not call a to when said guy just once again tried to iso 1 on 5 and almost turned the ball over again i thought cavs fans were a bit overblown with bickerstaff s bad coaching but they are every bit right i pray cleveland management won t get blinded by this winning and still keep his ass on the bench in the long run
neg,Pos,cavs collecting young stars outside of sf as lebron looks to be entering limbo on an incredibly old team with no flexibility and awkward fits we know how this story end the king comes back home for one last victory lap to put us over the top in a couple years
pos,Pos,the cavs aren t a fluke
pos,Neg,i m not predicting rings but cleveland is looking like it isn t an easy win anymore
neg,Pos,hey that was pretty fun
pos,Pos,sexton was dogshit at the end of that game and almost lost it for cleveland my god total black hole on offense
neg,Pos,guys were we wrong about the cavs
neg,Neg,refs are killing me with all these overturned calls i am so salty shout out to jarrett allen though wish the raps picked him up
neg,Pos,well that was fun as hell we lead for 4 seconds all night lmao the raptors team plays such good team defense they re so deep everyone is so athletic and so long so we ll coached that was a tough one
pos,Pos,fuck i hate these stressful finishes gg cleveland
neg,Pos,not even mad cavs and raptors got the 2 best players in the draft guess we will meet in the finals
pos,Pos,what an ending
neg,Neg,can t believe cavs never had the lead all game and then that happened
pos,Neg,are the cavaliers the most photogenic team in the nba
pos,Pos,cavs winning warriors winning we back
pos,Pos,gg cav bros but damn i m tilted fuck a ref
pos,Pos,evan mobley and scotty barnes are da future
pos,Pos,cedi s gonna be be able to recruit so many sister wives if he keeps this up
pos,Pos,that was a great ending wow
pos,Pos,we may never lose again
pos,Pos,the refs were terrible for the entirety of the last three minutes of this one
pos,Pos,scottie had that tip at the end just rushed it a bit would have been legendary all good though cavs earned the w garland is a fucking problem
pos,Pos,darius garland darius garland darius garland darius garland darius garland darius garland darius garland darius garland darius garland darius garland darius garland vdarius garland darius garland darius garland darius garland
pos,Pos,cavs are good
neg,Neg,im so fucking pissed right now fuck this shit
neg,Pos,honestly so proud of the raps and impressed by the cavs
neg,Neg,it was a well fought game kind of mad at freddie for some bad shots late in the 4th
pos,Pos,it hurts my eye to watch sexton
neg,Neg,had to work so only caught the last play intense moment raptors only had 9 free throws total were they not aggressive enough or were the referees letting shit fly
neg,Pos,fade me great to see mobley shine though
pos,Pos,raptors went for 6 make or break steals and got burned everytime even jarred allen banked a 3 pointer in because birch went for a bad steal hard loss for the raps who were leading every second until the last 5
pos,Neg,9 to 19 free throws is such a raptors statline
pos,Pos,mobley must ve wanted to be a raps so bad he tapped one in for us lmao but gg cavs what a helluva comeback
neg,Neg,if the cavs don t break top 10 in the next power rankings the league is rigged
pos,Pos,cavs didn t quit respect for that
pos,Pos,i m gonna have fun watching scottie v evan for the next decade can t wait to plan more work trips around games up north great game raps
pos,Pos,how the fuck was that a jump ball edit and garland blatantly fouling fvv which led to a jump ball and allen banking in that 3 ffs
neg,Neg,so the cavs are actually kinda solid this year wasn t expecting that
neg,Neg,good job cavs damn that game was a nail biter
pos,Pos,don t sleep on the cavs
neg,Neg,sometimes i think r nba is just raptors and lakers fans talking to each other
pos,Pos,raptor fans are saaaaallllllttttttyyyyy
neg,Pos,those freethrows at the end were garbage dumb way for that game to end the refs shitting on it
pos,Pos,i cannot stand watching collin sexton every time i do he does some stupid shit that makes me want to punch the screen
pos,Pos,that was some of the worst officiating i ve seen in a long time
pos,Pos,helluva game proud of em for fighting til the end
pos,Neg,barnes was insane early on and then cooled off a bit otherwise we would probably lose fantastic game cavs are playing really well and fighting hard cedi is our best shooter nowadays which is kinda crazy
pos,Pos,dang
pos,Neg,dude what a game
pos,Pos,heartbreaking
pos,Pos,cavs never lead until the last seconds wow
pos,Pos,fucking crazy entertaining game
neg,Neg,fun as game to watch shame about only being behind for 4 5 seconds but so many positives about the new look toronto mad hustle from the guys
pos,Pos,fuck
pos,Pos,hmmm so the east is just going to be a horror show of competitive team huh
pos,Pos,over 203 5 ughhhh
pos,Pos,i d love to see a replay on that potential goaltend on fvv anyone got the clip
pos,Pos,scottie barnes knows his judo well
pos,Pos,killer instinct is important and while the knicks killed off the bucks and cruised to a win the raptors failed to do this here and it s a lesson they learn and come back better
pos,Pos,brutal
pos,Pos,i saw dean wade and got instantly confused lol i was like i know d wade retired
neg,Pos,whats going on here are the cavs good this year why weren t we informed ahead of time
pos,Neg,east runs detours through cleveland
pos,Neg,this was a 50 50 game toronto list on jarret allen s 7th made 3 of his career lol
pos,Pos,og has been the best player on my fantasy roster
pos,Pos,gtj 6 steals this man was hustling all game love his energy
pos,Neg,cleveland are legit this year
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,cavilers stay healthy might stay in contention for a playoff spot
neg,Neg,i m not mad that we lost i m mad confused why that was a gary trent jr and sexton jump ball at the end either foul or travel
neg,Pos,i would love to the cavs v lakers in the finals just for the lolz
pos,Neg,how is it 3 games and og doesn t have free throws man refs really ain t feeling og yet because he s to damn strong
pos,Pos,wow great game haven t seen that level of determination from cle in years
pos,Pos,and we were missing markkenan love and okoro spooky season never ends
neg,Neg,the refs were absolutely atrocious they cost us the game
pos,Pos,i am taking this cavs resurgence seriously
pos,Pos,cavs are a playoff team
pos,Pos,ggs cavs that was a fun game i know the raptors just got off a 5 game win streak and its still early days but it feels like we have a real problem closing out games cleanly maybe that s just me hopefully that ll improve throughout the season
pos,Pos,the cavs are for real which just crazy considering how low that things looked after lebron left in 2018
pos,Pos,will cavs be legit this year they are playing good till sexton interview so this year will be the turning point will my wife let me see my kids a lot of question to answer
pos,Pos,name a better rookie than mobley i ll wait
neg,Neg,gg cavs no means is this loss to be blamed on reffing but can someone please explain that jump ball at the end i swear they didn t show the replay slow enough for me to get why that was the call
pos,Neg,sexton is monte ellis cavs are being held back big time
pos,Pos,lebron don t even gotta be in cleveland to break the hearts of the raptors anymore
pos,Pos,welcome to darionto
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,raptors fans salty af ur dudes got away with a lot of overly physical d like w trent jr great game tbh from both sides
pos,Neg,hell of a stop at the end garland had an awesome game too also feels like osman has had 75 of our 3s over the past few games when did he become a sharpshooter
pos,Pos,fear us
pos,Pos,really didn t think cle would have the horses to win this without lauri okoro and love really hard fought game by both teams especially for the regular season
neg,Neg,lot of teams should do what the raps did and purposely tank to get a top pick they could have made the playoffs last year but they just decided not to can you imagine if they actually traded lowry earlier for good picks and siakam is healthy theyd be a lot more dangerous
pos,Pos,i did not watch the game and i feel bad not seeing two of the best teams in the east battling each other but i m glad the team ruling east won also mobley is gonna funk around and win roy
pos,Pos,raptors only shoot 9 ft s tonight ah shit here we go again
neg,Neg,mobley barnes
pos,Pos,we lost to refs lol what the fuck was that
pos,Pos,the east runs through cleveland most road games in the league and sitting at 6 4
pos,Pos,east runs through cleveland
neg,Neg,suck it doubters we comin for dat ass
neg,Neg,lebronto is alive and well all jokes aside mobley and scottie look so damn good this draft class is nuts
neg,Pos,biased officiating and the cavs got every single possible lucky bounce
pos,Pos,refs plan
pos,Pos,fvv needs to stop forcing shots man 6 18 and taking stupid ass shots do better
pos,Pos,cavs took their first lead with 4 seconds left lmao
pos,Pos,sexton really tried his best to sell the game in last 15 seconds my god cavs were lucky to keep the ball
pos,Pos,if blondie ever refs a raps game we either lose or win barely despite the reffing she fuckin hates us lol
neg,Neg,don t get it twisted yall toronto played amazing for the whollle game og is a superstar looks at his block three and clutch 3 and scottie is a dime
pos,Pos,jarrett allen not having a single foul call against him and the cavs still having one to give at the end is disgusting they were getting away with murder
neg,Neg,you really post a thread that says the raptors win and then delete it right away lmao people out here thirsty for karma
neg,Neg,raps were the better team tonight refs were horrendous from jump
pos,Pos,bullshit refball fuck the nba lol
neg,Neg,that was a good game but holy fuck the refs were just dishing out some bs calls especially the sexton travel that they called a jump ball i m heated but that was scrappy on both sides and that always makes for a fun watch
pos,Pos,i honestly never say this but fuck those refs credit to the cavs at the same time yall got a squad id kill to have jarrett allen or even mobley if i could i feel so annoyed though freds horrible shot to ice the game the goaltend that wasnt called 2 solid defensive possessions at the end of the game only for og to trip him up and send him to the line so many missed opportunities and so many fuckin bad calls
pos,Pos,barnes roty
pos,Pos,cavs congrats but i really needed you to be worse this season we ve never made it to the second round
neg,Pos,looks like the missed goaltending call was costly afterall
neg,Pos,those calls at the end were trash garland should have never received those free throws shout out to jarrett allen though for hitting a 3
pos,Pos,goaltending
pos,Pos,wow they got literally every call in our own building cool
pos,Pos,east runs back through cleveland again
pos,Pos,wait the cavs are above 500 when the fuck did that happen
pos,Pos,what a scrap that was
pos,Pos,growing pains
neg,Pos,tough loss that allen hail mary mattered a lot
neg,Pos,wait what happened to kevin love lol
pos,Pos,free kat man free me i don t wanna do this 3 times a week
pos,Pos,we suck
pos,Pos,haven t seen pg this aggressive all season he saw his shot wasn t falling and just went crazy aggressive to the rim
pos,Pos,kat and ant had the same number of field goals made but one took twice as many shots
pos,Pos,this game might end up being 1 4 of pg s free throws the whole season lmao
neg,Pos,maybe if clippers start mann instead of bledsoe they wouldn t have to constantly fight back double digit leads
pos,Pos,this clippers team looks pretty resilient
pos,Neg,kat said something about it s easy to go from 3 straight losses to 20 straight losses looks like he could be right
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,it pains me to say this but ant s shot selection is really becoming a problem extremely reminiscent of his mid winter slump last year between that and this fucking team s inability to get kat shots they re sunk ant needs to prioritize attacking the hoop and the offense needs to run through kat finch needs to hammer ant on better shot selection or this season is done and he s gonna turn into another wiggins
pos,Pos,gg wolves the officiating was shall we say uneven wolves didn t help themselves by settling for so many 3s 51 attempts but getting just 5 free throws until garbage time was ridiculous
pos,Pos,2nd 40 pt turnaround of the night
neg,Neg,being up 20 to losing by 20 god damn
neg,Pos,lol wolves
pos,Pos,shout out to zu his paint presence changed the game in the third quarter
pos,Pos,hartenstein is really good wtf
pos,Pos,clippers had 60 rebounds wanna guess why
neg,Neg,i m starting to think kat s twitter wasn t hacked dude took like 2 shots in the 2nd half disinterested much
pos,Pos,man i have no idea how minnesota lost that what a weird game
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,led by 20 lost by 20 ouch wolves
pos,Pos,now kanye can fix wolves
pos,Pos,pg was clutch from the ft line he also got 11 rebounds 6 assists and 3 steals last year s steals leader had 2 0 spg for reference
pos,Pos,crunchy peanut butter wins
neg,Neg,its embarrassing that mann was making kats life difficult in that fourth quarter reminds me of kp
pos,Pos,crazy that they are down by 20 in the 1st half then win 20 points in the 2nd this team like to play behind and will grind you out even on their worst shooting nights
pos,Pos,paul george is playing out of his mind this year
neg,Pos,ant is so inefficient at this point in his career why does he take so many shots every game tbh that s on kat for being too passive as well but people talk like ant is already a great scorer when he s pretty much been a 20 points on 20 shots guy this season
pos,Pos,ant shouldn t have double the amount of shots against kat considering clippers interior defense
pos,Pos,ant shoots a lot of 3s
pos,Pos,i just i know our roster isn t amazing but we should be better than this
neg,Pos,the timberwolves being hyped as a good team every offseason is like ben simmons shooting 3s during summer workouts not worth buying into so in that way maybe simmons and the t wolves are a good fit for each other after all
pos,Pos,same team different year
pos,Pos,missed most of this game because i had to go do something when i left i honestly didn t think we d win when i got back we were comfortably winning from what i gathered it was a combination of a favourable whistle and the wolves being the wolves so not a great w but i ll take it i did see that apparently jaden mcdaniels fouled out in 12 minutes of play time i m interested to know if they were mostly legit fouls or were they ticky tacky
neg,Pos,hello darkness my old friend
neg,Neg,scored 27 points in the second half ain t gonna win many games with that
pos,Pos,that second half performance from the wolves was pathetic that team looked so defeated after we went on a 7 0 run to make it 82 71 that team lost the game in the 3rd quarter with that attitude playcalling and lack of shotmaking they had no chance in the 4th
pos,Pos,towns 7 11 on fga 3 5 from 3 edwards 7 22 3 12 from 3 antman taking more threes than towns takes shots is an incredibly unhealthy shot distribution for an offense
pos,Pos,fucking losers they should all get bullied post game they should have to sleep in the fucking cold with no blankets fucking losers
pos,Pos,gg wolves bros
pos,Pos,tough 5 game stretch upcoming 4 game loss streak can easily turn to 9 as kat mentioned
neg,Pos,that second half implosion was something else lmao this kills the wolves
pos,Neg,the 3 pillars of our franchise 1 a center who literally gets bodied by anyone can t even post up reggie jackson super passive but likes to scream at the refs can t make a pass to save his life 2 a sg who likes to chuck the ball and offers very little elsewhere 3 another sg who is pretending to play pg streaky guy who is best suited for a 6th man role i would say life sucks as a wolves fan but life has always sucked so this is the norm on the other hand terrence mann is amazing he took karl s balls tonight neutered kat
neg,Neg,clippers beat them the other day shooting 60 from 3 and won by 11 points this time they shot 20 and won by 20
pos,Pos,lolwolves
pos,Pos,pat bev crying in the club rn
pos,Pos,i feel like the wolves beat themselves so well if this roster and staff was anywhere else it s a playoff team but i dont know if that s gonna happen here
neg,Neg,the slide continues
neg,Pos,spoooooooky
neg,Neg,this offense fucking sucks
pos,Pos,the wolves are fucking useless
neg,Neg,good thing they ve made ant d lo and kat untouchable in any simmons trade you do not break up a core like that you just don t
pos,Pos,it s obvious this wolves core isn t gonna work looks like they desperately need a ben simmons
neg,Neg,when is this sub going to take off their blinders to the fact that edwards is another marcus smart who thinks he s good at shooting 3s and will chuck up 12 a game and miss most of them
pos,Pos,wolves are done cooked finished pack it up there s no coming back from this one
pos,Pos,wolves fans had the audacity to name players on this squad as untradeable
pos,Pos,worst franchise ever and wolves fans thought they were going to be good this year lol
neg,Pos,so ben simmons
neg,Pos,kat is so fucking soft i hope the next fan base that gets him realizes he s a puzzy
pos,Pos,terance mann needs to get back in the gym and practice his shots more 30 minutes on the floor with only 13 points dude has a ton of potential and needs to keep progressing his game this year he s getting a chance to prove himself and grow as a talent
pos,Neg,timberwolves are imploding you fucking love to see it morey is a genius for seeing the vision that shitty teams such as them would implode and get desperate soon
pos,Neg,yeah moe
pos,Pos,yuck
pos,Pos,how does edwards consistently take way more shots than kat lmao
pos,Neg,i didn t watch the game so i can t really speak in depth but why in the world did kat only have 11 fga ant doubled his shot attempts that is crazy
pos,Pos,edwards has massive potential but the iq is lacking short selection
pos,Pos,trade kat to phoenix
pos,Pos,so wiseman and kuminga for towns everyone good
pos,Pos,steph curry would like you all to be aware that he s a rim protector now
pos,Neg,shoutout to the guy in the pelicans thread who said for the love of god please stop showing the zion mtn dew commercials i love you
pos,Pos,strength in numbers baby
pos,Neg,gary payton ii has turned into must see tv draymond looking athletic andre dropping 10 assists warriors are must watch
pos,Pos,brickeil alexander walker
pos,Pos,i d rather watch young sheldon than my own team edit someone reported my comment as suicidal and now there s a reddit community cares bot reaching out to me
pos,Pos,this undermanned pelicans team without zion ingram and herb jones is a rough watch shout out valanciunas though
pos,Pos,this was a 4 point game at half
pos,Neg,iguodala with 10 dimes call him iguo dolla
pos,Pos,we re winning when steph isn t playing at his best that s the biggest take away from all these games guess what the score would have looked like a year ago if steph went for 19 points on 5 15 shooting
pos,Pos,man this wasn t just a win warriors put on a show haven t had this much fun watching this team since 2016 and this was with steph dray and wiggings being the boring ones and klay sitting on the bench we are going to be in trouble when it is time to pay poole gp2 and bjelica and lee
neg,Pos,might be a bit presumptuous but i think it s now legitimate to bring back this 2016 classic i love this team dudes
pos,Pos,with 11 minutes left in the 3rd quarter the pelicans were 2 points behind 52 54 and then proceeded to get outscored 33 to 72 points for the remainder of the game the warriors literally scored twice as many points in the second half gorgeous offense plus a combination of solid defense and the wheels just plain falling off for the pels
pos,Neg,warriors look spooky as fuck
neg,Neg,i m here to overreact about gp2
neg,Neg,the warriors are an absolutely elite defensive team and everyone on the team can score time to start seriously accepting that these dudes are contenders
pos,Pos,you shouldn t be allowed to post highlights against a junior varsity team
neg,Pos,gary payton ii
neg,Neg,holy shit how big is gpii s vert dude s like 6 2 and posterizing ppl without a running start
neg,Neg,81 1 still on the menu
pos,Pos,gary payton ii is the protagonist of his own anime
pos,Pos,are the warriors the best team in the nba people me are asking
neg,Neg,i truly feel like steph is having worse than normal shooting splits because he s playing the best defense of his career man is probably tired as fuck lmao wonder if he can adjust
pos,Pos,warriors the most fun team to watch in the nba hands down
pos,Pos,the warriors were just 10 5 point favorites lol
pos,Neg,y all called poole overrated after a few bad games catching his rhythm now
pos,Pos,20 3s and there was a stretch in the 2nd quarter when they were bricking wide open ones
pos,Pos,curry gunning for dpoy
neg,Pos,bricked 10 straight 3s ended still at 40 3pt
neg,Pos,nice performance by the big 3 tonight and by big 3 i of course mean poole gp2 and bjelica
neg,Neg,so the pels look a little rough huh
pos,Pos,to the fucking show
neg,Pos,someone post that gary payton poster my god
pos,Pos,pelicans is a basketball team
pos,Neg,man i m sorry pels fans your team is not very good right now
pos,Pos,that gp2 beli poole lineup is absolutely lethal
pos,Neg,feels good to see the dubs winning like this again
pos,Pos,this warriors squad looking scary as hell and they re getting wiseman and klay back i don t know how the minutes are gonna be distributed but i will definitely be tuning in every game
neg,Pos,back to the dynasty warriors we ve been accustomed to up by 4 at the half and win by 41
pos,Pos,part of me hopes the warriors win the chip this year just so steph can finally get the finals mvp he s been long overdue for
neg,Pos,santa cruz warriors are gonna be lit
pos,Pos,the amount of open threes the ws generated in the 1st quarter was insane if those second quarter open looks fell for them this would have been a 60 point difference man gp2 has some bounce
neg,Pos,it s getting late early for this pelicans season man this team is ass and zion is struggling to waddle his way onto the treadmill
pos,Pos,this golden state team is so fluid in their offensive firepower in this season
pos,Pos,this is like the 2015 2016 gsw
pos,Pos,again this team reminds me of that 14 16 squad a bench of misfits that fit together all of whom can all hit a three barbosa speights clark iggy off the bench now they have poole bjelica jta porter individually you wouldn t think too much about them but the more they play together the better they get and steph is basically playing like he s injured if any of wisemen moody or kuminga can add dependable rotation minutes in this season or the next the dubs are legit even without klay
pos,Pos,they faced 7 lottery teams so i m not going to overreact but the warriors will win the tile this year
neg,Pos,gp2 with all those dunks
pos,Pos,young glove young glove young glove
pos,Neg,wtf i left the gym when the score was 54 52
neg,Pos,god damn how does missing out on a recently drafted rookie deplete our defense so much like yeah we don t have z or bi but not having herb really messes us up
neg,Neg,this warriors team is insane
pos,Pos,that has to be legitimately one of the worst 4th quarter performances i ve ever seen from a team i get they are missing zion and ingram but omg legit giving up 4000 open cuts and then missing everything on the other end
neg,Pos,warriors really impressing to start the season
pos,Pos,i hope pelicans never get a national tv game ever again i dont care if the are 82 0 i never want to see them on television again fuck griff fuck the nba and fuck zion for being injury prone this is year 3 of this bullshit
pos,Pos,i love how the warriors have looked early but they have really benefited from an easy schedule let s see how they look against some good teams coming up
pos,Pos,zion ain t fixing this team at any weight
pos,Pos,warriors back to being the most fun and dynamic team to watch again
pos,Pos,i m in pain
pos,Pos,when your team is so deep that your superstar can t get good stats against bad teams
neg,Pos,bjelica with 33 in 18 minutes poole 31 gpii 23 and i love this man so much
pos,Pos,gpii stacking bodies rn
pos,Neg,we are a pretty good team
neg,Pos,we are truly 15 deep strength in numbers shot 50 3 s and 90 fgs lmao
pos,Pos,two teams crossing paths while going in opposite directions
pos,Pos,somebody post that gpii dunk at garbage time
pos,Pos,igoudala has silently racking 10 assists wth with this old man
pos,Pos,warriors are seriously 13 deep who is going to not dress when klay and wiseman are back
pos,Pos,stay away from these warriors just imagine when klay returns
pos,Pos,it s cool to see steph take the backseat to jordan poole i think it s safe to say this will be pooles team when steph retires
pos,Pos,this is your 2021 2022 world champions gs warriors
pos,Pos,538 predicts that the warriors are going to go 40 42 this season
pos,Pos,what a skullfucking by the warriors
neg,Pos,murdered them even in garbage time with our rooks
neg,Neg,team basketball is always great basketball
pos,Pos,i went away from the game for a bit to go work on something while it was still relatively close and then came back and what the fuck lmao
pos,Pos,you cannot convince me that the warriors aren t making it out of the western conference top to bottom come playoff time we are fucking monsters no one s gonna wanna face us
pos,Pos,wiz fans know about gpii he can light it up when given the green light good natural talent and has insane hops just never really given much run or chance to show it killed it for us a few seasons ago when given a chance to play had multiple games with 6 steals and put solid numbers on the board when he started warriors fans must be stoked
pos,Pos,there s been a murdah
neg,Pos,i know it s extremely early but is this the deepest warrior team we ve seen we not be as top heavy with slightly older curry draymond klay and iguodala but looking back at the 73 win team we had ian clark speights mcadoo jason thompson and varajao gp2 our 15th man really messing with my mind
pos,Neg,how can an nba team be this bad
neg,Pos,when ppl gonna stop sleepin on us
pos,Pos,i m more scared of the warriors than the nets as a lakers fan them boys know how to win
pos,Pos,zion jv bi will be a fun trio to watch when they finally play together next year
pos,Pos,wow warriors about to break their own win record 5 years later
pos,Neg,steph actually hasn t been shooting that great so far and no klay warriors are looking terrifying
neg,Pos,steph curry wasn t even the leading scorer and they still blew them out wow
pos,Pos,wwwwlwwwarriors
pos,Neg,great steph s taking this team back to the finals isn t he
pos,Pos,now this was a great game to watch gary payton is pretty good jordan poole looking awesome our rooks had some nice minutes too i m very happy with the season so far can t wait for klay and james
neg,Neg,steph dpoy confirmed change my mind
pos,Neg,warriors really found a 3rd splash brother _
pos,Pos,gary payton you nasty dawg
pos,Pos,jv
pos,Neg,warriors bench making it look like klay and curry are gunna come off the bench next week sheeeeesh bring back 2016 bois unselfish play is on the menu again weird how kd left and iggy came back for that to happen so much more fun to watch
pos,Neg,i think the pelicans said their safe word way before the end of the game but the refs ignored it
pos,Pos,elite team efficiency 52 2 40 85 7
pos,Pos,gpii to the dunk contest with you his offensive versatility has been better than i hoped seeing him run around like a 6 3 javale mcgee in our offense is just absolutely delightful
neg,Neg,jordan poole is really coming into his own must be great to see for warriors fans
neg,Neg,how did my man steph got 2 blocks
pos,Pos,no klay no wiseman and the warriors look really scary good feels like only good things to come for the dubs
neg,Pos,dear nba please stop putting the pelicans on nationally televised games they re trash
neg,Neg,i lost a 6 leg same game multi because the pels couldn t score a couple more for the 214 5 over smfh
pos,Pos,poole gunning hard for mip
neg,Neg,i enjoyed watching that basketball game
pos,Pos,milp man i love poole
pos,Pos,same score as the warriors game 3 win over the rockets in 2018
neg,Neg,am i reading this right dame had 4 points and they won
pos,Pos,if dame can be even average this seasons gonna go a lot better
neg,Pos,i d love to say decent showing for a team with two starters missing but man i m so freaking tired of moral victories can we get a fully healthy team this decade please
neg,Pos,boy having sabonis out there in crunch time to guard a small lineup didn t work out so well
neg,Neg,fuck dame only had 4 he s gonna kill us
neg,Pos,latest post game thread ever
pos,Pos,it felt like the blazers couldn t miss jeez
pos,Pos,lillard isn t in a slump but a whole ass oceanic trench i don t believe jacking up threes is the best offense there can be he seems to have zero surefire moves for when he is cold and god damn is he cold
neg,Neg,nah dame has an east african voodoo curse on him this shit don t make sense yes i m east african
neg,Neg,watch dame drop 50 tomorrow
pos,Neg,wtf is wrong with dame
pos,Pos,yes paid 60 in my fantasy draft for dame guess how i m doing
pos,Neg,dame should rest and sit out games he s only making his injury worse
neg,Neg,you ve gotta respect a 21 percent 3 point shooter a guy like that is always lethal
pos,Pos,maybe he s just passing well and shooting bad to adjust portland for simmons sorry idk he really is injured then huh
pos,Pos,what on earth happened to dame
pos,Pos,cj really been carrying dame this year
pos,Pos,wow we really killed it tonight charlotte s defense certainly helped but our whole team played great i couldn t believe we still had our starters out there with 2 minutes to go up 25 i know we re bad closing out games but jeeze
neg,Neg,we struggles all season from shooting and suddenly unload everything onto the hornets i have never seen a team leave buddy wide open for more than 10 possessions the disrespect
pos,Pos,did charlotte not get the memo that you re supposed to guard buddy he can shoot u know
pos,Pos,and this is why you draft bpa and make it fit 3 guard lineup all day
pos,Pos,thank fucking christ we re signed richaun holmes
pos,Pos,not so scary terry
pos,Pos,i fucking love this team man
pos,Pos,threeport metu with the final three was just beautiful
pos,Pos,my god the hornets are atrocious at defense
pos,Pos,cade who off night
pos,Pos,buddy hield
pos,Pos,the scores are back in sac baby
neg,Pos,richaun holmes got my fantasy team going off
neg,Pos,hayward going off in the 3rd was giving me a feeling we were going to lose this game
pos,Neg,we never losing again
pos,Neg,the entirety of this game is what we wanted to see richaun with the 20 20 game hield cooking fox looking more normal davion performing on both ends of the court etc i hope this is an indicator that we can beat teams that we have more talent than our start was very hard but we have a mroe manageable slate of games coming up and i d really like the kings to establish themselves in these next few weeks
pos,Pos,that 3 guard lineup is looking fine
pos,Neg,richaun holmes also had a new personal record of rebounds with 20 to go along with his 23 points
pos,Pos,i see the kings woke up wanting to be disrespectful today
neg,Neg,kings super team just young 4 guard lineup fox 21 pts 3 reb 9 ast buddy lol lakers buckets 26 pts 3 reb 3 ast hali 14 pts 3 reb 5 ast off night 19 pts 3 reb 2 ast 22 threes franchise record sheesh kangz all day babbyyyyyyyy luka is still fat
pos,Pos,unironically think buddy has a shout for 6moy he s been unbelievable off the bench
pos,Pos,richuan holmes needs a raise jfc
pos,Pos,man that double win we got against the kings looks better everyday thank god we not gonna have to play then when they are rolling
pos,Pos,hornets need a new center bad holmes and barns combined had more rebounds than the whole hornets team combined
pos,Neg,man the hornets look like they learned defense from the university of marvin bagley
neg,Neg,jesus why the fuck happened this game lmao when did sac become such a sharpshooting team oh wait buddy hield laughs in lakers
pos,Pos,our defense is so fucking pathetic
pos,Pos,disgusting effort cant wait for this west coast road trip to end
pos,Pos,terry rozier had himself an off nite
pos,Neg,so bouknight is going to get virtually no playing time this year why did they draft him
neg,Neg,i really just want to shit over borrego because he s so uninspiring and just got comfortably outcoached by luke walton but i just can t because mitch did such a piss poor job building this roster that i don t even think it matters we drafted four guys this year including trading 5 years of protections for kai jones can t trade our first rounders until 2026 yay and none of them are even close to seeing playing time the bench is a confusing mess and the starters start off every game by putting us in a 12 point hole we handed terry rozier a fat extension that starts next year and he responds by putting up 20 fg shooting nights with shit defense it s just so funny that we forced out cho previous gm for going all in on a core that just wasn t that good and then handed the keys to a guy who does the exact same thing but with a team that didn t even make the playoffs can t wait to see what happens next
pos,Pos,mason worse than biyombo plumlee
pos,Pos,kings are back
neg,Neg,hornets need tingus only allowed 38 fg in the paint this season pingus cmon fuckin do it
pos,Pos,jalen mcdaniels is being horrendously underused on the hornets it s like they want to have the worst ranked defense
neg,Neg,league mvp richaun holmes
pos,Neg,the kings are 5 2 against teams not named the jazz
pos,Pos,reffing was atrocious seemed calls were really going charlotte s way
pos,Pos,let s go kings my wc team
pos,Pos,damn hield is looking good
pos,Pos,lamelo with 24 pts 13 ast on over 60 shooting and 50 from 3 but 16 damn the kings were on fire
pos,Pos,terry rozier been straight ass all season
neg,Pos,bridges finally had a bad game that s crazy
pos,Pos,the kangzz are above 5 upvote party
neg,Pos,charlotte been struggling a bit since rozier came back need him to find his groove
pos,Neg,kings are going playoff this year b
neg,Pos,i hope you know ever kings game there are salty lakers fans gently running their fingers over b hield like that wolverine meme and asking the gods why why wasn t it you
neg,Pos,kings looking good lol
pos,Pos,games like these are painful to watch miss an open three then run laps down the court to give up an easy shot on the other end it also seems like we really enjoy giving other teams their franchise records in made threes
neg,Pos,don t give me hope
pos,Pos,as a kings fan a big lead is our biggest fear and bagley still can t get on the court during garbage time what a dogshit player
neg,Pos,my favorite team against my 2nd favorite team big lamelo fan favorite team wins lamelo finally has a great away game nice
pos,Pos,all you need to know about the game is the kings shot better than they will again all season idk how many teams have broken records for 3s against us now
pos,Neg,the kings did something
neg,Neg,homes had 20 rebounds damn
neg,Pos,look i ll take a w anytime but so many threes is making these games unwatchable
pos,Pos,any team that can defend can beat the hornets because the hornets do not defend
pos,Pos,the hornets won more games with oubre starting bench terry
neg,Pos,jokic with the block but gordon who done nothing all game with the clutch shots saved them lol
pos,Pos,it was a tough battle but the rockets successfully snatched defeat from the jaws of victory once again
pos,Pos,nikola blockic
pos,Pos,this has been the worstt game ive ever had the displeasure of watching in my life
pos,Pos,jokic turns into dikembe mutombo in the last defensive possession of close games i swear
neg,Neg,aaron gordon with the clutch shots and jokic with the clutch block just like we all expected
pos,Pos,epic tank job by the rockets
pos,Pos,what a block by jokic
neg,Neg,jokic dpoy
pos,Pos,three games in a row of playing really good but then not finishing frustrating
pos,Pos,you have to call the timeout there mr silas
pos,Pos,is jokic the greatest defensive player of all time
pos,Pos,jokic is a generational talent that is all i need to say
pos,Neg,i don t get not using a timeout
pos,Pos,clutch block at the end by joker
pos,Neg,mvp
pos,Pos,fucking aaron gordon ofc dude turns into curry last 1 minute of the game lmao fade me
pos,Pos,blocked
neg,Neg,epic tank job boys kpj bricking right when he needs to and ag turning into steph right when we need him to
pos,Pos,i turned off the game and the nuggets went on a 6 0 run to win by 1 think i ve been jinxing us lol
neg,Neg,jokic might legitimately be the best player in the league
pos,Pos,thank u ag for waking up when it matters we look rough as hell though hope mpj gets healthy soon also shout out to dpoy jokic lmao
neg,Neg,jok dpoy
pos,Pos,disaster class from silas i thought fans were being too rough on him considering the roster he s been dealt but this was unexcusable benching green not calling a to at the end i don t think he has long on the rockets pretty sure mavs would love to have him back though he s an amazing offensive coach but only with luka on the team not every team has luka
pos,Pos,jokic mvp b2b lfgggggggggg
pos,Pos,someone mentioned jokic playing like the first stint lebron at cavs days and yeah its showing
neg,Pos,lol
neg,Pos,jokic with the no scope at the end
pos,Pos,kpj is a terrible decision maker
pos,Pos,who would ve thought aaron gordon would bail us out with back to back 3 s
pos,Pos,clutch final 2 minutes by the nuggets aaron gordon making some huge 3 s nikola jokic is a animal
neg,Pos,dpoy
pos,Pos,joker dpoy joker dpoy
neg,Neg,damn it james harden
pos,Pos,we didn t even call a fucking timeout
neg,Pos,i dont like stephen silas
pos,Pos,i have to admit my concern for jalen green is now at a 2 10 the thing which i ve noticed which i don t feel like others have talked about is that it really feels like he needs a runway when he gets it he can do crazy shit with it like that dunk where his face was at the rim but what you see from the really athletic players is that they can take off instantly was just thinking about rose s famous dunk on dragic as an example and i don t really feel like i ve seen that from him
pos,Pos,silas is trash you want to develop our guards get kenny atkinson
pos,Pos,campazzo was fun to watch
neg,Pos,rough game to be a porter jr
pos,Pos,did mpj get hurt only played 7 mins
pos,Pos,people are gonna give me some shit for saying this but i think the rockets should look into trading for a pass first pg then move kpj over to sf i love it that kpj has done his best to modify his game in order to play alongside jalen green but i think he would thrive much better if he didn t have the responsibility of being the primary playmaker
neg,Pos,why is kpj in the game over jalen green at the end
pos,Pos,kpj sold this one to nuggets
pos,Pos,ryan hollins is horrible that s all i need to say
neg,Pos,please aaron gordon let me fucking marry you
pos,Pos,kpj leads the tank
pos,Pos,i know we re tanking an i m embracing it but fuck it d be nice to win some close ones
pos,Pos,at least daniel theis gets his trade value up i guess
neg,Neg,silas with the slick tanking move not calling the to there
pos,Pos,lol what a tank job
pos,Pos,nikola blockic got it
pos,Pos,the rockets shot selection in the last few minutes was so bad
pos,Pos,some really poor coaching at the end by silas
neg,Pos,tank commander kpj
pos,Neg,so uhhh is kevin porter jr ok and why is he getting clutch minutes over jalen green i enjoyed watching this rockets team a lot especially alperen but kpj is a problem and not in a good way lol
pos,Pos,disappointing night for porters jr
pos,Pos,we are trash right now but a wins a win
pos,Pos,not a great day for the porter jr family
pos,Pos,monte morris with the team high 15
pos,Pos,i liked the play when j green grabbed the board passed to porter jr who swung it to gordon for 3 denver or houston fans
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i m guessing jalen green was benched the last 2mins because he s a defensive liability
pos,Pos,competitive most games and still losing is a win for the rockets i mean really this team isn t going anywhere this year and can only make things worse by winning too many games develop some of these young guys stay in these games without winning too many of them get a great draft selection and build off of this year they re not getting blown out a lot and they re playing hard and still losing best case scenario for them in my opinion
pos,Pos,idk why marlowe randomly said jokic is sengun s idol for no reason lol sengun didnt play like it fun battle tho
pos,Pos,damn so close
neg,Pos,our team outside of jokic is not good
pos,Pos,someone post a vid of the block asap
pos,Pos,why didn t we call the timeout
neg,Neg,why does this keep happening wish we can close games easily
pos,Neg,kpj man wtf
pos,Pos,nuggets look horrendous rockets had that won they just started playing dumb
neg,Neg,this was a game
pos,Pos,what team did houston beat
pos,Neg,rockets need to draft a point guard neither kpj or green can run an offense forcing them to be what they aren t can be detrimental to their growth
pos,Neg,i wonder if the rockets are going to go on another 19 game losing streak
pos,Pos,these rockets were a few points short of winning several games this year their rebuild is going well so far
pos,Pos,if the rockets win 9 games this year my mind will be blown
pos,Pos,i m sure someone else has probably mentioned this but i randomly decided to check the box score on espn and saw eric gordon vs aaron gordon porter jr vs porter jr and three j greens lmao
pos,Neg,nuggets playing much better without mpj in the rotation new ben simmons situation potentially
pos,Pos,malone needs to stop playing with a million guards the man makes the same mistakes as he did last season frustrating we play with 6 playmakers jokic in rotation
pos,Pos,clutch loss honestly that s what i like to see
neg,Pos,wow just when i thought the jazz were gonna fall apart they showed why they are one of the best defensive teams in the league their defense became suffocating and it completely changed the momentum what a great game by both teams though
pos,Pos,what a freaking game holy crap the start of that 4th quarter was unreal with how mesmerizing we were hitting every shot herro going nuclear getting a 20pt lead and the jazz coming right back with some heavyweight punches of their own to claw their way back and have a shot to tie it at the end fully expect to finish again with the best record out west gg it s an awesome bounce back win and our gauntlet of a schedule continues on to denver
pos,Pos,herro good lowry good jimbo good heat good
pos,Pos,that was exciting let us never do that ever again
pos,Pos,apologize to herro
neg,Neg,markieff morris was a 20 for miami in 20 minutes that bench cooked
neg,Pos,mitchell so good
neg,Neg,that s as proud of a loss as i can remember gg heat two top teams just slugging it out
neg,Neg,great challenge by spo at the end i think we lose that game if that call doesn t get overturned
pos,Neg,something is going to have to go seriously wrong for herro not to win 6moty
neg,Pos,how do fans deal with their teams blowing leads i almost had a damn heart attack
pos,Pos,took my sister to this game as her first ever nba game did the job
pos,Pos,miami shot 60 overall and 52 from three the jazz still managed to come back from 19 down with under 6 minutes left to get it to within 1 wow
pos,Pos,finals preview
pos,Pos,heat are scarier than i thought they would be if lowry plays like lowry and herro turns into a star they re dangerous
pos,Pos,herro is an all star
pos,Pos,this would be a sick finals matchup
pos,Pos,props to herro for hitting literally everything in the 4th quarter
pos,Pos,heat are 7 2 with wins over the jazz nets mavs bucks and grizzlies not bad for a bunch of bubble frauds
pos,Neg,the jimvp train rolls on
neg,Pos,fucking credit to the jazz for the late comeback absolutely made us shit ourselves glad we were able to hold on need duncan to get his shot back
pos,Pos,didn t expect the game to turn into a heartstopper but i ll take the w gg jazz
pos,Pos,wtf was that last play
pos,Neg,tyler herro is for real
pos,Neg,jimmy chad mvp alpha butler
neg,Pos,jazz shooting needs to pick up especially off the bench seems like they ve got a lid on the basket lately we will definitely have more fun when gay gets healthy miami looked unstoppable for the large parts of this game they re scary
pos,Pos,holy shit that felt like playoff game gg jazz
pos,Pos,the heat are looking dangerous looking forward to our matchup but also terrified at the same time
pos,Pos,imagine trading for harden instead of keeping herro
neg,Pos,holy shit what a game hard to win when they shoot 52 from 3 love the fight and not gonna win them all not a bad l at all
neg,Neg,gg heat fans as much as i hate you all
pos,Pos,big show from mitchell tonight first guy this year to really pop off against our defense
pos,Pos,well that was unnecessarily stressful
neg,Neg,jimmy butler offensive game has drastically improved from last season like crazy
neg,Pos,whatever slump clarkson is in hopefully he snaps out of it soon
neg,Neg,yeah i could go for this as a finals matchup
neg,Neg,goatee tyler herro is the 6moy we deserve
pos,Neg,i enjoyed this here s to 7
pos,Pos,great to watch as a neutral
pos,Pos,may this be the ultimate finals run for dmitch and the jazz because holy shit they re just good
pos,Pos,all of a sudden leads don t matter anymore
pos,Pos,heat just couldn t miss we ll get our revenge in slc for sure ggs heatbros
pos,Pos,what a game
pos,Pos,man if jc and ingles hadn t been colder than a corpse dick
pos,Pos,how in the hell is a brand new team playing so well with possibly the toughest schedule ever assembled and the lakers are complete puddles of mud on the court with such a cupcake schedule
pos,Pos,my heart
pos,Pos,why pay gobert 41 mil when you have whiteside for the minimum
pos,Pos,the heat are pretenders r nba after one heat loss lol
neg,Neg,that was about to be a magnum opus in choking
pos,Pos,from super relaxed to absolutely clinched in the span of a few minutes love you miami
pos,Pos,the heat give up a ton of open threes i thought what happened in the 4th was going to happen in the 3rd but then was shocked for it to happen in the last 4 minutes of the game this would be a super fun finals with d wade and whiteside on the other side
pos,Neg,so i was watching the panthers beat the hurricanes fuck yeah and actually completely forgot about this game god damnit so i m looking at the box score and seeing we outrebounded utah and shot 60 and somehow this was a 3 point game what the fuck
neg,Neg,is lowry that big of an upgrade over goran dragic some dumbass scout
pos,Pos,why did mitchell take that rushed shot at the end still 10 seconds to get a better look
pos,Pos,yea utah relax i was about to enjoy a stress free heat game and give d wade back pls gg
pos,Pos,hell of an effort from the jazz to come back they locked in on defense at the end and mitchell had everyone on skates goddamn herro was shooting the lights out in the 4th before the jazz tightened up ggs jazz bros
pos,Pos,what a finish
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,that was such a fun game nice to get a win over the best team in the west after that shocker against the celtics good bounce back game
pos,Pos,photo of devin booker
pos,Pos,glad we won but mitchell pulled up for a game tying 3 with like 7 seconds remaining why do so many teams do this type of dumbass play late in game idk why this pisses me off so much
neg,Pos,that shit was scary down the stretch but we can always count on jimmy g buckets to pull through
neg,Pos,this was awesome let s do this again next saturday utah
pos,Pos,that s heat basketball
neg,Neg,jesus fuck that ending gg
pos,Pos,great game jazz we truly brought out the best in each other and this was a good test for us great game before we start our western road trip
pos,Pos,jazz y all are really good man ggs
neg,Neg,gg jazz
neg,Pos,gobert against a center worth his salt and he becomes the scrub he is
pos,Neg,someone told gobert it was a playoff game
neg,Pos,let s go heat
neg,Pos,that game made added 5 years to my age please no more of that heat thank you very much
pos,Pos,insane run by the jazz at the end one of the best games of the season so far
neg,Pos,what was that final play
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,terrible shot by donovan at the end of the game
pos,Pos,embarrassing last 10s by the jazz especially considering the last 10m jazz are still an elite team happy to get a win here
neg,Pos,of all the things about the nba probably my least favorite is how refs seem to take pity on smaller players and let them play by different rules if tyler herro bear hugs rudy gobert on a roll it should still be a foul despite rudy being a foot taller that being said rudy needs to do a better job of not letting no calls affect him mentally it s been a recurring trend that a few bad calls and he gets frustrated and plays poorly not a great showing from him tonight
neg,Neg,what a game proud of our fellas for making that a nailbiter at the end after being down a lot heat are really fucking good
pos,Pos,heat almost gave the game away they kept panicking to drives gave up wide open corner threes then couldn t buy a shot to keep the lead finally got their shit together at the end
pos,Neg,i know it s regular season but just thinking about the bucks heat playoff match up is interesting
pos,Pos,jimvp
pos,Neg,see you in the finals
neg,Neg,how you gonna shoot 15 threes man
pos,Pos,
neg,Neg,what a choke job by the heat
pos,Pos,ez af
pos,Pos,what is duncan s role on this team
neg,Neg,i hope utah can really figure out their zone they are gonna need it come playoff game glad that staff realized it during the offseason and implemented it both these teams looking legit early
pos,Neg,
neg,Neg,i went from depression to hopium overdose dangerously quick what was that 4th quarter
pos,Neg,korked
pos,Pos,i never want to hear the name korkmaz again also it s time to start djj over green
pos,Pos,
neg,Neg,are the sixers better without ben simmons edit yes
neg,Pos,sixers are 6 0 since shake milton returned
pos,Pos,imagine thinking korkmaz isn t a top 10 player in the nba
pos,Pos,this sixers team just seems like they have each others back and really play for each other very selfless and connected
neg,Neg,steph turkey does it again
pos,Pos,we d lose to embiid and 4 traffic cones literally cannot beat this team
pos,Pos,the sixers are really turning into jazz east a defense the leans heavily on an elite rim protecting center and an egalitarian ball movement dribble hand off offense with lots of decent scorers and lots of shooting
pos,Pos,1st seed sixers
neg,Pos,he doesn t give a doo he can ride and he can shoot he s the fastest gun around bang bang lucky furk
pos,Neg,if vuc keeps playing like this i would rather have tony bradley start
neg,Neg,god damn bulls didn t want to die but philly hit big shot after big shot gg philly
pos,Pos,if embiid shot 4 5 from 3 and he s not even the best shooter that night that s a wrap lol korkmaz shot 7 9 from 3 while bulls shot 7 29
pos,Pos,i love danny but start korkmaz congrats to doc on his 1 000th career win 10th all time for all the criticism myself included you can t take that away from him
pos,Neg,congrats on win 1000 doc
pos,Pos,kork 7 9 from downtown i could feel stacey king dying inside bit by bit as every kork 3 went in
pos,Pos,how spoiled are we where seth has a bad night and is 5 11 from the field
neg,Neg,sixers good
neg,Pos,i love the sixers lets go team yahooo
neg,Pos,how do you celebrate 1000 wins pop the kork
pos,Neg,i m so glad we resigned furk for 3 yr 15 mil that contract is as good for us just as good as seth s
pos,Pos,damn sixers really are going to be 1st seed again this year honestly 4th seed at the lowest top 6 is getting even more spicy bucks are still at 10th but i suspect they enter top 4 when they recover from injuries
pos,Pos,danny green tobias simmons lol and matisse out only 9 active players 3rd game in 4 nights away game the ultimate trap game
neg,Neg,we got a fucking squad seth has been red hot korkmaz is a fucking killer and niang has been an amazing pick up along with maxey coming into his own this game has made me feel like we are for real absolutely depleted and we stay winning
pos,Pos,we grew a whole division of bombers
neg,Neg,until vucevic remembers how to play basketball again bulls are legit comments shall be put on pause
pos,Pos,we started bball paul and the bulls lost lol
neg,Pos,anyone want a gently used vucevic
pos,Pos,don t look now but embiid may be 7 0 james harden bro hit 4 step backs tonight like they were easy
neg,Pos,man vooch we need you to start playing better big man i know he will snap out of it eventually but he s taking way too many jump shots rn and his shot just isn t falling
neg,Neg,big game from jojo korkmaz is god also shout out to glenn rivers on win 1 000
pos,Pos,this is easily the most depth the sixers have had in years credit to morey drummond and niang were great pickups add in furkan becoming turkish t mac and they re in a great place
pos,Pos,with every win ben simmons in shambles
neg,Neg,korkmaz tho dude couldn t miss
pos,Pos,korkmaz and niang or steph and klay lmao
neg,Neg,the dichotomy between the on court sixers and off court sixers is pretty ridiculous right now
neg,Neg,tough loss sixers got a squad tho
neg,Neg,upon watching this game i was uttering for about 15 times why is korkmaz rated as c to b im 3 pointers in 2k22
pos,Pos,how do we keep getting these convincing wins against fully healthy teams docs rotations are amazing right now even so shorthanded
pos,Pos,vuc is testing my patience man embiid s out there hitting side step threes while vuc is missing open shots in the paint
neg,Pos,this team really keeps winning just to spite ben you love to see it
pos,Pos,lets fucking go king of the east
pos,Pos,bulls fan can t be surprised we knew going into the season this team is going to have big problems with dominant all star bigs but god damn was that game 6 klay out there cause korkmaz shot like this game was personal
neg,Neg,shoutout to the one bulls fan that said we weren t a playoff lock
pos,Pos,weird that even with all those comments about the refs giving the sixers the win on wednesday at home they still beat the bulls on the road without two starters and tisse
pos,Pos,ownership of chicago has been transferred from aaron rodgers to joel embiid and furkan korkmaz
neg,Pos,it s crazy how opposite the narratives on these teams are when one team is 8 2 and has played a much harder schedule than the one that is 6 3 if you only looked at the media you would think the bulls are 9 0 and the sixers are 0 10
pos,Pos,did not expect to win this one great victory
neg,Neg,someone post jojo s step back 3 and immediately waving bye to some dude in the crowd please
pos,Pos,fight fight fight for the cherry and the white for the cherry and the white korkmaz is gonna impregnate some temple chick tonight
pos,Neg,furkan is clearly the best number 30 in the nba
pos,Neg,bball paul
pos,Pos,we are missing multiple starters and on the road we somehow pull out that win
pos,Pos,huge game from joel and the sixers especially against that kind of star power
pos,Pos,another player down no big deal to us
pos,Neg,no simmons tobias harris and matisse and chicago bulls still cant get the job done
pos,Pos,no harris simmons green or thybulle sixers bench stepping up hard
pos,Pos,why didn t the bulls foul on the possession embiid hit the 3 with about 30 seconds left if the sixers made a shot that possession the game was basically over with how much time they let run off made no sense to me
neg,Neg,man vuc is like a black hole in offense and defense needs some valanciunas out there
neg,Pos,whole team dead fuck it win anyway
pos,Neg,ben simmons for mip look at much we improved without him
neg,Neg,someone get me a link of that embiid step back 3
neg,Neg,imagine paying duncan robinson 15 million a year when we have korkmaz for 1 3 the price lol
pos,Pos,sixers handing out another embarrassing loss to a healthy team you love to see it kork is so good
neg,Neg,caruso is not a reliable offensive threat he has no business playing 30 minutes on a contender
pos,Pos,lol our c team beat one of the best teams in the east so far we may never lose again
pos,Pos,gg bulls love your team its coming together nicely really didn t expect to be able to grab this one but our role players are scorching hot right now
pos,Pos,everyone hates sixers fans but tonight s win is some earned obnoxiousness
pos,Pos,third game in four nights playing only eight players due to a cornucopia of reasons and with the opponent mostly healthy and having two full days of rest no way we should have won this game textbook schedule loss no one told korkmaz
pos,Pos,chicago was really wasting everyone s time at the end there huh
neg,Pos,goddamit vooch
neg,Pos,i definitely popped my kork watching that shooting
pos,Pos,6 in a row with another man down each game it seems this team is all vibes
neg,Neg,an amazing game overall but the game was completely determined on vucevic on embiid
neg,Pos,if i ever have to hear those bulls announcers bitch about soft ass calls again it will be too soon
neg,Pos,embiid with the bye bye to the crowd is hilarious
pos,Neg,gg bulls bros fun game you re a new squad you need time to clean up the sloppiness and build a bit of chemistry
pos,Pos,chicago deep dish is a casserole
neg,Neg,swing and a miss by the bulls bulls look legit tho
pos,Pos,i just realized after this game the bulls are going small ball but with no real 3 point shooters and their center thinks he is steph curry i mean he shot more threes than everyone else except lavine for the bulls
neg,Neg,our guys need to learn to stay on the ground against jumpshooters got them back in the game with those stupid fouls but bulls fans got a fun team to watch great game and love our bench showing out this season
pos,Pos,korkmaz
pos,Pos,lonzo is not worth is contract il continue to say it in every bulls game thread
pos,Pos,hmm it turns out we might not be the best team in the league
pos,Pos,if vucevic is just bad and not horrible chicago wins this game
pos,Pos,it s truly disgusting how simmons made allstar over trae last year cause he impacts winning a year later and we re seeing its as dumb now as it was back then
pos,Pos,sorry but embiid jokic embiid at rim is fucking insane him seth and bench just won big
pos,Pos,whispers are the sixers somehow better without simmons
neg,Neg,embiid wants mvp
pos,Neg,i honestly don t know how we are winning without two of our starters and don t know if this is even remotely sustainable but i m thoroughly enjoying it
pos,Pos,no thybule tobias or green and still beat the bulls twice relatively comfortably this sixers team is deep
neg,Neg,congratulations orlando
pos,Pos,sixers are averaging more assists as a team than they did with simmons on the roster even with it being a down scoring year and the 1 seed without him dude really wasn t doing anything out there
pos,Pos,gg bulls people really fun and talented team you have this is the best demar i can recall ever
pos,Pos,vucevic is not a good fit for this bulls team now that they have derozan they need someone who s a more dedicated defender
pos,Pos,how y all bulls fans feeling about vuc
neg,Neg,can one of my homies post that jojo dagger
pos,Pos,the bulls entire offense is basically zach and demar iso and bail us out vooch has been awful to start this season their bench is bad at scoring their bench really needs white because at this point billy is going to drive demar to the ground
neg,Neg,furkan korkmaz owns the bulls
neg,Pos,bulls fans do not despair rejoice for you have been touched by the good and most holy furk daddy
neg,Neg,first bulls game i ve watched this season liking what i m seeing there
pos,Pos,you ve been fucked by fourth quarter furk
pos,Pos,trade harris asap
pos,Neg,really fucking good team win the sixers don t win those in years past
neg,Pos,76ers are our kryptonite
neg,Neg,i mean hopefully vuc picks it up he s having a rough start to the season and i wonder how much of that is the bulls having so many mouths to feed
pos,Pos,is vucevic less glorified cavs kevin love now
pos,Pos,furkan korkmaz
pos,Neg,this team is making it rain
pos,Pos,does vucci normally take seven three pointers
pos,Pos,vuc is an overrated player put up big numbers on a crappy magic team they should try to find a good deal for him
pos,Pos,kork in my ass
pos,Pos,the turkish delight
neg,Pos,alex caruso with over 20 mins logged oh shit
pos,Pos,i say this while knowing that vuc is a starter level talent but the man needs to not start for a few games he s clearly in a slump and forcing him out there to not function is doing no one any good let him play against backup bigs until he gets his legs back under him bradley isn t the better player normally but right now he ll do less damage to the team s chances
neg,Neg,simmons who
neg,Neg,embiid is a bad man
pos,Pos,really embarrassing loss for the bulls they clearly aren t ready to be in that upper tier of the east if they are going to lose to the sixers missing half their team twice
pos,Pos,sorry bulls you just ain t on our level morey needs an apology he s one ben simmons trade away from making us favorites
neg,Neg,so is it safe to say the early bulls hype was premature they just lost to us twice while we were missing multiple starters both times
pos,Pos,indescribable agony
neg,Neg,luka magic is really fun when it s not happening to you
pos,Pos,smart gave an intentional foul when the cs could ve had the ball back with 6 seconds the dumbest decision i ve ever seen
pos,Pos,kp with 21 points while making 0 three pointers is actually impressive his offensive game was much better and different than usual
pos,Pos,solid game from kp was locked in tonight
neg,Neg,luka is gonna be the highlight on this game but kp deserves a lot of credit dude finally made good decisions timely cuts to the basket great vision on the kickouts didn t try to overstep his role he came back with a vengeance
pos,Pos,luka hates boston confirmed
neg,Neg,where s the guy that bet his life savings on this game because of the virginia shit post
pos,Neg,kristaps finally understood the assignment
neg,Pos,losing to a shot like that in a game where we had a lead once in the 4th quarter for like a minute you just tip your hat and move on gg
pos,Pos,daddy
neg,Neg,you just knew it was going in when luka shot it another game winner against the celtics man has blood out for them
neg,Pos,marcus smart is an idiot bro theres 18 seconds remaining dallas ball and the shot clock is at 12 why would you take a foul and let them turn the clock off to take the last shot of the game
pos,Pos,on jrich makes this so much sweeter lmao
pos,Pos,what the fuck
neg,Neg,here s your dallas mavs post game summary now in our 6th season 6 did the mavs win luka mavs are undefeated in our new city edition jerseys marcus smart doing a solid for his hometown team with that foul there at the end luka just loves hitting buzzer beating 3 s for win against the celtics doesn t he luka with 33 9 5 doing everything tonight shooting some midrange 3 s and of course the game winning buzzer beater welcome back kp dude look fresh aggressive tonight putting the ball on the floor and playing hard defense finished with 21 7 2 2 steals doe doe with 9 4 2 all of 3 3 s bench analysis brunson burner went back to the bench tonight and continued his 6th man campaign with 13 5 5 to lead the bench mob reggie with 13pts off 3 3 s to match jalen in bench production
neg,Neg,luka magic and luka cursic
neg,Pos,mavericks are gonna fuck around and get a top 4 seed in the west is this the year where the mavericks break their dry spell and make it to the second round had east
neg,Neg,why take the foul mavs had 5 sec on the shotclock and they didn t even cross half court yet
pos,Pos,that shot was just so ridiculously insane straight luka magic
pos,Pos,jason kidd drawing a luka game winner in that to what a genius
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,why is smart fouling there lol
neg,Pos,luka and hitting tough shots name a better duo
pos,Pos,luka bad motherfucker doncic
neg,Pos,i miss jaylen already
pos,Pos,im glad kristaps remembered that he s tall
neg,Neg,luka magic
pos,Pos,the death of luka doncic was greatly exaggerated
pos,Neg,damn he s good
pos,Pos,luka with a team high 10 in a 3 point win he s always the star but he played a very efficient game today
pos,Pos,what a fucking shot gg mavs future of the league is in good hands
pos,Neg,that man hates the celtics
pos,Pos,we are the kings of ugly wins but we ll take 6 3
pos,Pos,why does luka hate us man
pos,Pos,luka legend
neg,Neg,kp was great
neg,Pos,as a celtics fan holy shit i wish we had luka with tatum him and trae young are by far my favorite non celtics in the league what a fucking shot
pos,Pos,ahahahahahahahahaah it never gets old
pos,Pos,this is good because boston lost
pos,Pos,one of the worst fouls in quite a while by smart considering game situation
pos,Pos,pain
pos,Pos,that was the dumbest foul ever
pos,Pos,the kp putback off the brunson miss and that dagger 3 was a filthy way to end the game gj mavs need the cs to stay down while brown is out lmfao
pos,Pos,not again
pos,Neg,can t believe we blew a 20 pt lead but the ending was worth it
pos,Pos,marcus dumb
neg,Pos,luka is just unbelievable we re witnessing the first steps in the career of what will be one of the all time greats
pos,Pos,kp stepped up in the 4th after being lackluster for most of the game offensively 10 of his 21pts were in the final quarter also defended well and got that clutch block this was relatively consistent throughout the game though
neg,Neg,luukaaa called gamee
pos,Pos,luka magic i missed you
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,halleluka
pos,Pos,what a freaking shot
neg,Neg,my gf is concerned i m hard
pos,Pos,if the mavs add a big man like adams or valanciunas they re a top 3 team
pos,Pos,jason kidd 6 3 rick carlisle 3 7
pos,Pos,i don t know a lot about basketball so i was really confused by that foul thought it must ve been the right play since ya know the professional basketball player did it nope smart is just dumb
pos,Pos,lukaaaaaaaaa
pos,Pos,smart just gave a dumb foul
pos,Pos,why did smart foul at 4 seconds left on the shot clock we would have forced a shot and got the ball back with 10 seconds to tie lead am i missing something
neg,Pos,why the fuck did smart basically give us the possession
pos,Pos,imagine thinking that giving the last shot to dallas is a good idea
pos,Pos,what a wonderful day
neg,Neg,luka dagger doncic strikes again
neg,Neg,was that the coach s call to foul luka or did smart do that himself i was shocked they did that lol
pos,Pos,i can t wait to listen to scal on nba radio tomorrow lmao
pos,Pos,that rebound that hit tatums foot really crushed the momentum
neg,Pos,damn this is the first win of the season that s actually made me feel good
neg,Neg,feels like luka has been improving from the line this year good for him
pos,Neg,which is tastier a celtics loss or their announcers salt
pos,Pos,luka was like what you re not doubling me and he had something to teach boston about that
pos,Pos,i m just here to shit on the kings
pos,Pos,he can t keep getting away with it
pos,Pos,smart giving the foul and letting mavs have the last shot was dumb as fuck and fits in with his play in the last couple of minutes he should have given away other fouls the refs didn t call and his attempt at drawing a foul was comedy gold
pos,Neg,we re only 2 games behind the celtics neat
neg,Pos,marcus smart is worth a 77m extension btw heart and soul of the team btw
neg,Pos,trae doesn t hit that shot
neg,Pos,why did the celtics foul because it s the celtics
neg,Neg,shout out to marcus smart a man who hasn t improved a single aspect of his game in 4 years but somehow has the self assuredness to call out the development of the actual good players on the team in front of the media i wish all of us could feel this type of delusional confidence no matter how fucking dreadful we are at what we do
pos,Pos,i love when the celtics implode
pos,Pos,helps inevitable laker loss
pos,Pos,those last few minutes were a mess at least luka gave us a cherry on top of that shit sundae
neg,Pos,can someone please make a post about luka s career averages against the celtics the man hates us
pos,Neg,defensive specialist marcus smart making the worse defensive play of the night
neg,Pos,both teams were terrible at boxing out at the end
pos,Pos,such a boneheaded foul by marcus let luka get right to his spot with time to spare instead of forcing him to go downhill and improvise a shot that still would have left time on the clock for the c s disappointing jt haters wya tho
pos,Pos,let s gooooooo
pos,Pos,this game don t count the c s are missing their fp jaylen brown
neg,Pos,luka with the game winner best and perfect from the line maybe this will keep the haters at bay for now
pos,Pos,wcs was somehow a 7 with 0 point 0 rebound and 0 assist
neg,Neg,heat mavs celtics heat
pos,Neg,mavs absolutely crumble when defenses start getting more aggressive in the 4th they were lucky to come away with this one
pos,Pos,loltics celtics are the new knicks
neg,Neg,all that effort to comeback for nothing lmao
pos,Neg,no
neg,Neg,6 3 but looked doo doo every single minute is kinda impressive
pos,Pos,horrible execution down the end
neg,Neg,booker was fire tonight
pos,Pos,god damn it bogi wtf was that lol
neg,Neg,so i don t watch hawks basketball but they sign kevin huerter to a 16 million year contract and he puts up 6 points a game on 36 shooting is something up with him
neg,Pos,feelin kinda sunny bois not gonna lie
pos,Pos,that was literally the worst possession for a game winning shot i have ever seen
pos,Pos,nader really isn t it suns should ve used the rest of that mid level on torrey craig fun game to watch though good to see even with ayton out they can hold their own hopefully the suns continue to gel so they re ready to push for good seeding asap
neg,Neg,the shot selection by the hawks in the final minute were so questionable
neg,Neg,devin foot on the line booker
neg,Neg,how did we win this game lol
pos,Pos,you just got franked
neg,Neg,interior defense and rebounding kinda ass without ayton frank was great offensively though team is still really struggling to shoot the three in general book was awesome tonight cp3 continues to rack up the assists and knock down shots with needed it feels like his role on this team has evolved from last year and he s really only looking to score when needed or the situation clearly calls for it shamet also had a big contribution in that 4th when we were down
pos,Neg,cp3 is the man
pos,Pos,that one hurt right now we have adjustment problems from last year there are too many mouths to feed and some guys are just feast or famine it feels like a rhythm and rotation problem i know its probably an overreaction because we have been playing some great teams but it just doesn t seem like everyone is on the same page these past few games i also suspect that the longer the season goes this weakness of too many bodies might becomes a strength suns are going to be tough for anyone yet again this year i also stream the games and want to say the suns broadcast team was probably my favorite so far this year as well that was a fun duel
pos,Pos,frank the tank sends his regards
pos,Pos,bogdanovic said no ot tonight this game had crazy energy and was a ton of fun to watch our defense sorely misses ayton when he s out but damn if frank didn t make up for it with his offense gg atlanta let s meet in the finals and have seven of these
pos,Pos,ik plus minus ain t mean much in 1 game but christ paul in a 5 point w was 26
pos,Pos,devin booker
neg,Pos,i had to scroll disrespectfully low for this post game thread
neg,Neg,frank is better than people realize
pos,Pos,mfs really used to try and tell us booker wasn t a winning player
pos,Pos,26 in a 4 point win goat
neg,Neg,what was bogi thinking
pos,Pos,absolutely disgusting once again
pos,Pos,booker is back
neg,Neg,that felt like a playoff game insane game
neg,Neg,back to back to back half point covers after missing the cavs cover by half a point damn the oddsmakers are good at their jobs
pos,Pos,fuckin hell that game was fun i would take a 7 game series between these two teams next june
pos,Pos,great game in the last quarter just whipped my hawks ass gutted i hope the coaching staff and the players assess their decisions down the stretch great game by phoenix in the 4th
pos,Pos,devin armani booker is that guy
pos,Pos,felt like a playoff game
pos,Pos,no reason booker can t be a top ten player in the league
pos,Pos,this team is hella frustrating to watch
pos,Pos,great 3 point shooting by booker last 2 games no overreaction but booker with a 3 point shot is the mvp
neg,Pos,the question shouldn t be whether dbook is an allstar or not it should be whether he s a superstar already or not
pos,Pos,felt like a playoff game the only problem i had with this game is the ref the hawks were not allowed to play physical at all in the 4th trae needs to be smart with the ball don t need to shoot deep three in the last 2mins of the quarter fun game overall
pos,Neg,i could really see this team being 4 10 out of this road trip
pos,Pos,bump him down to the second best bogdanovic in the league
pos,Pos,don t like the suns forcing so many threes especially my boy cam but wow book and mikal are just so smart i don t even care
pos,Neg,
neg,Pos,chris paul is nba all defensive team if they let him defend like that
pos,Pos,hawks have a lower winning pct this year than when lloyd pierce was fired last year
pos,Neg,kaminsky is playing great this season deserves more minutes than mcgee
pos,Pos,trae regular season is boring young hold the l kid
pos,Pos,horrible plays drawn up by the hawks at the end wtf was that airball
neg,Pos,blow the team up
pos,Pos,time to sell hawks stock and invest in ben simmons coin
pos,Pos,fuck these refs cp3 could commit murder and it still wouldn t be called jesus fucking christ
pos,Pos,trae contested 3 and bogdan catch and shoot off the pick a meter behind the 3pt line aren t the best shots i could imagine getting but maybe that s just me nate you do your thing bro
pos,Pos,john collins shooting stats are crazy
pos,Pos,refs 121 hawks 117
pos,Pos,achievement unlocked reach 90 points
neg,Neg,bron to pelinka rn
pos,Pos,our garbage time squad blew it wtf
pos,Pos,can someone please tell russ the ball needs to go in the hoop
neg,Neg,not a single starter reached 10 points don t remember the last time i saw that in an nba game
pos,Pos,genuinely curious what s going through lebrons head watching them lose like this
pos,Pos,don t let the score fool you it wasn t that close
pos,Neg,this was one of the basketball games i have ever seen
neg,Neg,that stretch wherein westbrook drew two fouls for 4 fts then subsequently taking two awful shots that led to easy threes for the blazers is the most westbrook thing ever
neg,Pos,lebron firing up the espn trade machine as we speak
pos,Pos,malik monk austin reaves can ride the bus back to the hotel everyone else gets to walk edit sekou doumbouya and jay huff can ride the bus back to the hotel too
neg,Pos,i ve never seen a team tank when they don t have their own draft pick
neg,Neg,you know what i tried defending westbrook against awkward speech and such people but goddamn he is so fucking trash like even if he was paid 15 20 million these stat lines after 2 3 games is so fucking frustrating i get where all the westbrook haters come from un fucking believable lilard wasn t shooting well yet distributed the ball all these games and this mf had 6 assists and 6 turnovers what the fuck and yeah i know lebron wanted him just because lebron made a stupid decision doesn t mean i can t show frustration to westbrook s trash playing also ad see a doctor see a fucking doctor you re not 43 years old you soft playdough with sugar bones
pos,Pos,lob city lite disappointed today
pos,Pos,death taxes and lillard owning westbrook
pos,Pos,damn russ shooting 7 7 from the field single digits almost more turnovers than points too that looked painful
pos,Pos,sekou scored more points in 8 minutes then westbrook in 29
neg,Neg,the lakers won the 4th 28 12 and we still won by 15
pos,Pos,dont worry guys westbrook heats up in the middle of the year
neg,Pos,jingle bells ad fell westbrick missed some threes bron looks old bazemore sold and lillard owns the team i saw this thing in an instagram comment
pos,Pos,technically that was legally speaking a professional basketball game you might find that fact surprising since the blazers were playing like shit and yet the lakers were discovering whole new reservoirs of organic artisanal fermented donkey shit to play like and nonetheless got blown the fuck out of the building
pos,Pos,we not making it past the first round lmao
pos,Pos,you thought he was a mvp he trick yall he just running around doing nothing
pos,Pos,fan presti will take westbrook for 4 1st round picks and this is important austin reaves deal
pos,Pos,russell westbrook 8 pts 9 reb 6 ast 6 to 1 13 fg 5 8 ft los angeles lakers 34 fg 28 3pt we can never win with those numbers westbrook in particular has to do better in these kind of games where ad and lebron are absent tonight was completely disgusting the game was worse than the score line suggests we got blown out
pos,Pos,absolute trainwreck
neg,Pos,holy garbage time comeback game was not as close as final score
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,maybe the real winner of the lakers wizards trade is the friend we make along the way
pos,Pos,i think the texas longhorns football team would have played a better game of basketball tonight
pos,Pos,keep talking about my squad our personnel ages the way they play we re past our time in this league etc etc etc do me one favor please and i mean please keep that same narrative energy when it s begins that s all i ask
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,congratulations lakers at least your garbage time team is better than the blazers garbage time team
pos,Neg,this sub was quiet tonight
pos,Pos,lakers fans on twitter crying about a trade already you love to see it
neg,Pos,lakers were down by 30 before garbage time this team cannot be this garbage there has to be some sort of chemistry issue here what s concerning is that we saw these issues last season and the roster changes didn t fix them man i m sad i dunno i just wish the lakers weren t hot garbage we lost to the thunder twice isn t that enough
pos,Pos,lillard lives in westbrook s head it was always hilarious to watch westbrook struggling now it s sad because this goddamn halfwit is playing for my favorite team smh
pos,Pos,it wasn t as close as the score indicated
neg,Neg,aye everybody get in here
pos,Pos,is this the first time in nba history that none of the teams starters reached double digits
neg,Neg,malik monk on a minimum is 10x more valuable than westbrick lol
pos,Neg,lakers locker room smells like bengay
pos,Pos,wow what a surprise westbrook isn t a winning basketball player
pos,Pos,lebron playing gm will have surely cost himself at least 2 championships by the time he s retired
neg,Pos,man seeing westbrook play like that makes me sad
pos,Pos,laker s fan reaction to the russell westbrook experience
pos,Neg,i don t even care that the lakers were injured it s always a top 5 game in the season for me when portland destroys the lakers at home seeing all of the yellow kobe and bron jerseys leave early and be sad brings much joy to me it s in my last rites to put fuck the lakers on my tombstone
pos,Pos,wow wire to wire basketball this is what the nba is all about
pos,Pos,don t let the score fool you this game was a fucking embarrassment for the lakers and fuck not having two of your best players as an excuse for not even trying during the game
neg,Neg,aye it s the thirst thirstiest time of the year aye yuh i have just one query what s that wanna sprite cranberry uh huh the answer is clear it s the thirst thirstiest time of the year sprite let s go
neg,Neg,can t wait for lebron to come back so he can publicly yell at westbrook whenever he makes a bonehead play just like how he used to do to jr smith we ll see how westbrook handles it could be some fireworks
pos,Neg,who would ve thought that starting 3 max contract players with zero starters that can reliable shoot the three would not work out that well this season
pos,Pos,come home bron we got a spot at sf
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,we are in trouble
pos,Pos,blazers only score 12 in the 4th and still won by 15
pos,Pos,the nba is better when the lakers are imploding
pos,Pos,instead of a super team the lakers have a super old team
pos,Pos,could ve sworn that we experiment with the geriatric roster back in early 2000s and the result back then was welll
pos,Pos,22 8 true shooting for russ lmao
pos,Pos,this is why you don t let myteam players construct your roster
neg,Neg,3 of las starters scored exactly 1 field goal with the remaining 2 scoring 2 and 3 respectively with none of the 5 hitting double digits that shits embarrassing
pos,Pos,where is lebron
pos,Pos,washedbrick
pos,Pos,holy shit we re ass
pos,Neg,ad literally sick to his stomach with this lakers team
pos,Pos,can lebron trade himself for ben simmons
pos,Pos,these lakers motherfuckers actually thought bazemore could start
pos,Pos,calling it lakers will miss the playoffs lbj quits basketball dubs regain title steph is finally finals mvp
pos,Pos,don t let the score fool you this game was not that close
neg,Pos,the game was not as close as the box score would suggest
pos,Pos,dame is slumping russ is washed
pos,Pos,reaves scored more than westbrook
pos,Neg,slumpin dame with 25 6 3 on 9 19 shooting in 31 mins obviously not up to his standards but encouraging compared to his first 9 games
neg,Neg,missed the beginning did they do any video or tribute or cheer for melo s return
pos,Pos,at least they narrow the margin from 40 to 15
pos,Pos,russell westbrook is an embarrassment
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,westbrook is so ass lol
neg,Pos,why did they start dj over dwight am i wrong isn t dwight still actually kinda good whereas dj is just a corpse
pos,Pos,just when i think westbrook couldn t possibly play any worse he shows up with this gem
pos,Pos,i was told you re still suppose to win games without your two best players
pos,Pos,everyone knew westbrook was washed except legm lmao
pos,Pos,i have a gut feeling that the bubble is the farthest the lakers will ever get in the lebron era i want them to do well and i want bron to win his 5th but man
pos,Pos,westbrook retire bitch
neg,Pos,trust me the game was not this close
pos,Pos,live by the westbrook die by the westbrick
pos,Pos,westbrick i believe
pos,Pos,that performance brought back good old 2014 memories
pos,Neg,lakers is garbage what a joke of a team and everyone was acting like they were a superteam clear favorites to win the west lmao
neg,Neg,russ is so ass bro lmao
pos,Pos,thanks for the trade lakerbros
neg,Pos,the lakers are so freaking bad
pos,Pos,how long before the lebron s gonna trade ya chants start
pos,Pos,is this lebrons way to get liliard to lakers
pos,Pos,i will repeat this to death russ is completely washed and he was like this for 3 years now he will eventually bounce back against a shitty team with a shittier competition than todays blazers and that says all and just shooting the ball 15 to 20 times with shit efficiency and statpadding bad for rebound and assist will make you fool to follow him in reality russ i a washed player by now who they just need to stop playing trading for him the last 3 times it happens doomed the team if not for the wizards which had found a dumbass organisation giving shit ton of value for an ex player it is really sad to see a once great player been ridiculoulized by himself only because he pretend to be still good meanwhile russ is putting up horrendous numbers on absurd ammount of possession for a player of his level when you all will realise he is below average player by pure skill set and comprehension of the game russ need to retire so bad and i really think this will be his last year he is failing bad by now and he is being even worst than last year
pos,Pos,wb dribble dribble dribble pull up jumper airball wb dribble dribble dribble drive kicks it out and to wb dribble dribble dribble tight pass and to wb spot up three bricks rinse and repeat that was his game plan
pos,Pos,wtf is going on
pos,Pos,lakers playing 2012 s greatest hits isn t working so far looking like a first or second round team at best if lebron can return and stay healthy age is catching up to him it seems now with all this little nagging injuries and load management all of a sudden
pos,Pos,holy shit those are the saddest shooting stats i ve seen since last years playoffs
pos,Pos,1 14 from russ lmao
neg,Neg,worse than the 2013 lakers
pos,Pos,lakers suck
pos,Pos,lakers got lucky in the bubble
neg,Pos,lakers got lucky with golden state for the play in
pos,Pos,if you can t handle me at my worstbrook nvm bestbrook is dead
pos,Pos,pelinka failed lebron ad the last 2 years this is an awful roster
pos,Pos,jesus christ with lebron out the lakers defense is so bad 1 4 that even prime hakeem olajuwon can t save this team
pos,Pos,can someone please in good faith i ask why i got mass downvoted a few weeks ago when i said if carmelo is las 3rd best player that spells disaster for this team
neg,Neg,lakers need to discover some sort of offensive scheme that isn t totally reliant on james doing everything for them they really need kendrick nunn back because rondo and westbrook just can t run an offense between them and its not entirely their fault either because guys hover and are too lazy to run screens they were so foolish to let caruso walk
pos,Pos,amazing how bad la look without lebron but also kinda not given the records of these guys before linking up with him
pos,Pos,lakers probably win against the hornets lose vs the heat and get lebron back on friday 6 6 with lebron back they ll be ok
neg,Pos,dame is back 17th fastest player to 17 000 points
pos,Pos,i was on the russ hype train but after tonight i m done with him get this man off the team immediately
pos,Pos,i hope to god the lakers can figure it out before the trade deadline or we about to miss the playoffs altogether with this squad and it s looking like that so far
pos,Pos,guys hear me out crazy theory but the lakers are tanking rn without lebron so when he comes back and wins the chip no one says he assembled a super team cause they re ass without him
pos,Pos,can t wait for lebron stans to blame everyone from teammates to coaches but refuse to admit lebron asking for westbrick is a disaster
pos,Neg,people lets be real the lakers need lebron without lebron there is no title chance its that simple i expected westbrook ad to carry the lakers with lebron out so ill give them time
pos,Pos,we ll be fine once we re fully healthy i genuinely believe that however i don t think i have a ton of faith they can stay healthy enough to see it through to the end
pos,Pos,idk why but this lakers team is giving me 18 cavs vibes
pos,Pos,what possible trade destinations are there for melo hate to see his twilight years wasted on a lottery team when he could definitely contribute to a playoff squad
pos,Pos,russ just running around doing nothing
pos,Neg,harden went from having a dogshit game in the 1st to ending up having the best game of anyone on the court by the end of the game kd was great too obviously but he also turned the ball over 7 times
pos,Pos,harden completely took over in the 4th quarter holy shit
pos,Pos,how the actual fuck do you guard kevin durant
pos,Pos,name a better duo than fatboy slim going for 59 18 15 go on im waiting that last quarter is what i m waiting to see everyday in the playoffs
neg,Neg,can both sides agree that the refs were absolutely garbage
neg,Neg,how s kd is even better after his achilles injury
pos,Neg,harden s first step is improving quickly
pos,Pos,think some raptors fans will overreact to this but there s a lot of positives here this team still appears far ahead of schedule with regards to the rebuild what it does show is how seemingly effective systems can simply be overcome by superstar performances i ve never seen anyone find gaps in such a strong defence as kd did tonight
pos,Pos,that s 5 in a row let s go for double digits
pos,Pos,kevin durant is a once in a lifetime type player and talent and third quarter showed y all why
pos,Pos,things that fucked us 1 kd showing he s the best player in the world 2 harden clutch shots and playmaking 3 raptors offensive woes 4 early blake 3s 5 brown floaters
pos,Pos,mvp
neg,Pos,gary trent single handedly kept us in the third
pos,Pos,brutal 3rd quarter for the raptors nobody could hit a 3 scottie needs more shots siakam was great for his first game all in all we didn t have birch im really excited for this teams future gg nets
neg,Pos,first time watching the raptors in a while they re a pretty fun team especially on defense even with some errors but lots of energy and their commentators were solid
pos,Pos,man can kyrie just come back we are missing chances to watch all 3 play healthly
pos,Pos,lol i saw all the highlight clips on the front page and thought the nets were getting fucked
pos,Pos,i consider this current raptors squad as a legitimate playoff team in the east hence this w by the nets is definitely a welcome sign nets defense as a whole this season has looked miles better compared to the whole of last season it s very encouraging to see that this team isn t reliant on simply bombing teams offensively
pos,Neg,a single game completely changes the narrative on james harden right
pos,Pos,kevin durant is the best player in the world and the front runner mvp no debate
pos,Pos,i like how the raptors build their team just tall everywhere scottie is gonna be really good he knows the game has a good frame harden looked like he s working his way back and getting closer phenomenal 2nd half by him and the team kd remaining consistent as ever good game
neg,Pos,giving up 5 offensive rebounds to harden is killer man
pos,Pos,harden looked great in the 2nd half it s good to see him driving to the paint more and a quiet 31 points for kd he s just unreal
pos,Pos,respect blake s hustle
pos,Pos,i been saying it kd is been the best since 18 no cap
pos,Pos,good team win
neg,Pos,kd mvp campaign continues
pos,Neg,pascal rusty but that s exepcted svi got torched
pos,Neg,well that was unpleasant really poor execution in the second half
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,the nets and 76ers are proving they don t need their australian divas
pos,Pos,harden is healthy again
pos,Pos,raptors defense looked awful kept leaving the corner 3 open
pos,Pos,lol from the frontpage posts on r nba i thought the nets were losing this game by 20
pos,Pos,ngl you do have to laugh at the front page rn when there s like 4 highlights posts of scottie and fvv cooking the nets and then the game thread with the nets winning lol
pos,Pos,svi got cooked in second half
pos,Pos,horrible defensive 3rd quarter shut us out of a game that was close for the rest nurse really coached bad this game bad rotations and defensive scheme wasn t reacting to what was actually happening at all
neg,Pos,nets made their 3s and this killed us oh well need to give scottie more touches as he might be our best player
pos,Pos,raptor freezing out their own rookie 7 shots i know he s a rook but i feel like you can find more than 7 shots for the dude
neg,Neg,scottie with 5 steals
pos,Pos,sorry haters
pos,Pos,inexcusable for scottie to only have 5 shots until garbage time raps have zero creators aside from him too so its even tougher for him
pos,Pos,nets looking like contenders
neg,Pos,that was a close game until harden remembered that hes good at basketball
pos,Pos,wait i thought harden was washed
pos,Pos,at least scottie barnes had a couple of steals though keep those highlight clips coming
pos,Pos,a good game overall refs super inconsistent doe but what new
pos,Pos,damn i thought scottie dropped 50 based on what s on the front page
pos,Pos,with the amount of toronto posts on the front page each day you would have thought they were 11 0
pos,Pos,7 30 from 3 is less than ideal
pos,Pos,it s funny how it feels like the nets have struggled a bit so far this year yet they re 7 3 must be a nice spot to be in
pos,Pos,with all the top posts on r nba you d think the raps won by 50
pos,Pos,all of the scottie barnes clips would make you think the raptors won by 30
pos,Pos,man if i only looked at the r nba highlight clips i would ve thought the raptors won by 30
pos,Pos,now 2nd loss in a roll with dragic dnp cd dragic fault
pos,Pos,just like we all predicted 76ers at 1st in the east without simmons heat at 2nd in the east after getting swept by the bucks nets at 3rd in the east without kyrie bulls knicks and wizards in 4 5 and 6th and the bucks dealing with injuries at 10th i definitely predicted these standings 3 weeks into the season haha
pos,Pos,raptors fans here s a breakdown of why barnes 0pt second half was actually an indication that he s going to be first team all nba followed by nick nurse switched to cherry bubble gum here s why this cements him as the goat
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i don t like watching precious play basketball the dude is so lost out there on both offense and defense birch was really really missed tonight honestly feel like precious needs to spend time in the g league
pos,Pos,once we get birch back and siakam s minutes scale up to normal i think we ll be in really good shape also boucher is on dnp watch precious should see a heavy drop in minutes too both will look nearly unplayable once we re at full strength
pos,Pos,people are going to focus on the defence which wasn t what it could be but you re playing the nets and they re just another level on offence so i m really not that worried about it what i really want is more ball movement on offence our offence looks terrible some of this is down to personnel but the amount of isolation basketball we play for good stretches is central to the anemic outcome i understand we don t want to put too much pressure on barnes on that end i think this is a good strategy for his development nevertheless i really would like them to run some high post act through either barnes or siakam in a line up with one centre put birch precious in the dunker spot low post run 3 shooters through some cut action and get something going i really think barnes could thrive running a few plays a game through the high post
pos,Pos,seeing all the other threads before this i thought the nets had lost haha
pos,Pos,great game devastating 2nd half by the raps couldn t hit any threes and nn fucked us by having svi play zone defense for too long we play this game in later in the szn again and we have a much better chance
pos,Pos,really weird game from the raps too many iso plays and defensive breakdowns we usually move the ball much better than this and have much better defensive rotations but some great positives to take away siakam looked good scottie barnes is not scared of anybody on defense and gary trent jr turning into demar derozan is just an added bonus lol
pos,Neg,y all mofos keep complaining about how the frontpage is filled with raptors highlights and not the nets well no one is stopping you from posting their highlights is there take action instead of whining
neg,Pos,that 4th quarter raps offense was rouggh gotta reacclimate to the spice kudos to the nets on the close out anyhow
neg,Neg,7 threes made vs 17
pos,Pos,how well do bam and giannis do on kd i forgot i feel lik if they cant really slow him down with their length and somewhat mobility for their size damn
pos,Pos,that durant guy is pretty good i think he has a future in the game
pos,Pos,them raptors are so long i mean siakam og barnes broucher lmaao kd struggled with 7 tos but still dropped 31 on 61 shooting alien lmaao
neg,Pos,this is basically how i expected the team to be this season
pos,Pos,two guys that can t stop kd winning the mvp is this version of harden and jokic gg raptors actually i read that many of you were not happy with nurse scheme you might tell me what you think was a better game plan i really think nets this game where just too good and sconce they re improved on the defensive end iirc top 10 before the game it s kinda hard to beat them now imo edit lma with 5 assists lol
pos,Pos,james harden scoring well while still not going to the line that much is the james harden fans deserve
pos,Pos,most important question was drake there and witnessed the loss
pos,Pos,just found out kd harden and ibaka were drafted by okc and were playing for okc final in 2013 couldn t beat lebron wade and bosh of miami
pos,Pos,would love to see this game with sane reffing and the raptors with a little more 3 consistency likely the same outcome but became a pretty annoying game to watch
pos,Pos,we might never lose again
pos,Neg,uh oh the cavs are playing playoff worthy basketballlll
pos,Pos,ricky rubio is a treasure and it pains me to this day that he had such a brutal injury so early in his nba career
pos,Pos,ricky rubio hitting his prime at 31 years old we call that shit hitting his mersenne prime
pos,Neg,no sexton lauri okoro and love and we still get the job done evan mobley is the real fucking deal
pos,Pos,i honestly can t even be that mad rubio had the game of his life mobley is going to be a cornerstone for the cavs though he looked great tonight idk what the ceiling is but he didn t look like a rookie out there i can tell you that
neg,Neg,the cavs have played like 20 of their road games and are 7 4 an all around great day for cleveland and therefore the world
pos,Pos,in conclusion cavs are back
pos,Pos,i m ready to overreact is mobley a hofer
pos,Pos,first the browns game and now this holy shit this was a good sunday to be a cleveland sports fan for once
neg,Neg,just saw a stat that ricky was 8 37 from deep the four games prior to tonight s scorcher
pos,Pos,never seen rubio and jordan in the same room
pos,Neg,rubio wins wherever he goes low key underrated competitor and great locker room presence
pos,Pos,rickey rubio is the best player in cleveland cavalier history
pos,Pos,evan mobely s on off numbers are insane the guys impact on both ends of the court is something you almost never see from a rookie
pos,Pos,who is the last rookie to impact winning basketball games the way mobley is right now stats are one thing but he literally plays nearly mistake free basketball on both ends of the court it s insane he s the direct reason why the cavs are actually good right now forget roty if the cavs are above 500 and he s putting up around 17 9 4 he should make the all star team
pos,Pos,e steb an curry
neg,Neg,ricky rubio is a hybrid of mj and curry
pos,Pos,we got a fucking squad now
neg,Neg,rubio eat this thibs
pos,Pos,who would ve thought the cavs would have a better record than lebron
pos,Pos,our rebuild is coming along quite well
pos,Pos,jarrett allen all star mobley roty and all defensive team rubio 6th moty
pos,Pos,lol look at you fools come rushing into the arena come take a seat the gates are wide open thats right the east still runs through believeland we have evan garnett
pos,Pos,rick and mobley edit credit to armentro1landon for this
pos,Neg,we run the east something worth saying is that the cavs were missing love sexton lauri legend and okoro which means were deeper than a mine
neg,Neg,mobley with a quiet 26 9 5 scored most of his points within the flow of the offense nothing flashy or forced got tim duncan esque poise on the court looks like a future cornerstone for the cavs
pos,Pos,i was told the timberwolves didn t draft steph curry what the fuck was that
neg,Pos,this team has it they feel galvanized and love playing together mobley is coming as billed most unselfish superstar when he was posted up on one possession ricky gave him a bad bounce pass that was way wide and he dove on the ground for it it was unsaveable but most guys just look at the guard and run back down the court he just plays relentlessly perfect perfect attitude towards the game
pos,Neg,altman has done a great job setting up the cavs when he signed allen people cried overpay when he drafted mobley people said why draft a center when u just paid one he cant play pf he signed lauri they said three 7 footers weren t going to work this team is legit and jbb said locker room knows something special is brewing in there and they all wanna be apart of it
neg,Neg,ricky rubio
pos,Pos,any day ricky fucks thibs over is an awesome day go get teague you oswald cobblepot lookin mfer
pos,Pos,rick and mobley this cavs team is fun as hell
pos,Pos,evan mobley team high 26
pos,Pos,when you hold steph curry ricky rubio to under 40 points that s a w in my book
neg,Neg,cavs activated fiba rubio
neg,Pos,mobley is playing like a 10 year vet as a rookie
pos,Pos,i wonder how much lebron thinks about ditching bum westbrick and coming back to cavs
neg,Pos,mobley making an argument for roy
pos,Pos,obi toppin deserves more minutes he is really good
pos,Pos,rick and mobley rick and mobley yeah rick and mobley rick and mobley rick rick rick rick rick rick rick rick rick rick and mobley yeah rick and mobley yeah rick and mobley yeah rick and mobley rick rick rick rick rick rick rick rick rick rick and mobley rick and mobley rick and mobley rick and mobley rick rick rick rick rick rick rick rick yeah
neg,Pos,those last two passes by mobley buttered my biscuits
neg,Pos,the way mobley can play great defence without fouling is insane future dpoy
pos,Pos,first knicks game in 15 years got a ticket 15 rows behind the backboard for less than half price on stubhub 5 minutes before gametime and i saw that 3rd quarter was embarrassing they did some work in the fourth but couldn t get a stop to save their lives at least i got to see ricky rubio go the fuck off
pos,Pos,i wish mobley s stuff got posted around here more there s like no highlights on the page of the game rn
pos,Pos,can someone check woj s twitter i think the warriors accidentally trade curry tonight
pos,Pos,ricky makes my peepee sneeze
pos,Pos,ricky rubio
neg,Neg,ricky rubio tn
pos,Neg,cavs have a fuckin squad
neg,Pos,for the first time since he s joined the league the cleveland cavaliers actually have a better team than the other team lebron is on
pos,Pos,the east runs through cleveland
pos,Pos,the fact that mobley and allen can play together makes this cavs team seem pretty legit really makes them tough defensively
pos,Neg,i wanted rubio to go to a winning team for the longest time never knew that it would be cleveland though not mad though
pos,Neg,cavaliers demand to be taken seriously this was a good win on the knicks but on the real though who expected ricky rubio to be a secret weapon for the cavaliers it s hard to beat a team that was shooting like they were wasn t even bad defense imo just solid offense
neg,Neg,ricky 3 bio
pos,Pos,we have played every other night all season 8 of 11 on the road down 4 guys in our rotation please be ok collin and yet here we are edit oh and every team we played was i m the olay in or playoffs last year except the raptors
neg,Neg,no words needed
pos,Pos,feels good to have a real team
pos,Pos,the cavs the last few wins have really phased out those really bad quarters where we just do nothing and lose big impressive stuff maybe j b bickerstaff is the real deal man
pos,Pos,lebron boutta head back to cleveland
pos,Pos,congrats cavs mobley is looking amazing as a raptors fan i was definitely hoping he would fall to us and for what it s worth word is that mobley was supposedly masai s first pick he even tried to trade up for him the last time he tried to trade up in a draft was a skinny kid from greece just for some perspective
pos,Pos,fuck the refs and fuck r nba your apology needs to be as loud as your disrespect
neg,Pos,rubio putting on a passing and shooting clinic
pos,Pos,rick miguel jordan rubio
pos,Pos,on filipino american heritage night for the knicks rubio is the one that balls out damn
neg,Pos,that jarrett allen guy is ascending
pos,Pos,i always loved ricky
neg,Neg,fuckin mobley mans a beast
pos,Pos,evan mobley is going to be tim duncan don t me
pos,Pos,ricky rubio i think you mean spanish steph
pos,Pos,hopefully ricky rubio wins a championship someday one of my favorite players
neg,Pos,these cavs are an exciting bunch even rubio getting career highs like damn lol
pos,Pos,never thought i d say this but ricky rubio is the greatest ricky to ever play for the cleveland cavaliers move over ricky davis maybe if they would counted that rebound you shot off your own hoop
pos,Pos,evan mobley is the best player from the draft
pos,Pos,mobley another long boy with skills
pos,Pos,mobley will be a superstar someday that kids too damn good
pos,Pos,lebron about to ditch the lakers to get to the cavs and get another ring
pos,Pos,i didn t expect the cavs to be making so much noise i m proud of them
neg,Pos,was just checking in on my fantasy guys mobley and allen but apparently this spaniard went nuclear holy shit
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,sad timberwolves noise
pos,Neg,mobley is fucking gooooooood
pos,Pos,evan mobley is my favorite player since steph curry thank the lottery gods for this one
pos,Pos,mobley allen and garland and tonight rubio are making it fun to be a cavs fan again and i m here for it
pos,Pos,evan mobley is deceptively quick and crafty a true coach s son
neg,Neg,that s my esteban nash
pos,Pos,mobley reminds me of a slim tim duncan his demeanor is pretty similar too
pos,Pos,evan mobley with the 26 is nuts
pos,Pos,man it was fun rubio allen mobley were great
pos,Neg,tristian thompson wasn t lying when he said the cavs run the east
pos,Pos,bing bong mfers
pos,Pos,watch lebron come back now to the cavs
pos,Pos,that home court free throw disparity
pos,Pos,i didn t complain about mobley but i wasn t cheering him like i did sexton or garland i m so sorry for that how can i make up for that egregious mistake
pos,Pos,evan mobley 300 rookie of the year 10 bucks win you 30 i d give that a shot if i could
pos,Pos,cavs have the 9th best record in the nba and we just gotta accept it
pos,Pos,mike breen was going nuts last night when rubio kept hitting 3s
pos,Pos,the cavs are back and so is golden state sheeeeet
pos,Neg,evan mobley can t win rookie of the year because he plays like an 11 year veteran
pos,Pos,got em
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,rubio with his best fuck you thibs game
pos,Pos,this game convinced me we should trade sexton he s just too much of a ball stopper for a winning basketball team i think he could be a part of our future but he needs to fundamentally buy in to the way the cavs moved the ball once he went out with his injury
pos,Pos,fully prepared for the overreactions from knicks fans to this game
pos,Pos,cavs are he re baby cavs are fucking he re baby
pos,Pos,ru ru rubio
neg,Pos,fiba rubio is back
pos,Pos,the cleveland cavaliers have a better record than the defending champs wow
pos,Pos,rubio and mobley have me light headed
neg,Pos,the only good thing for the knicks tonight is that we are one night closer to the start of college basketball
pos,Pos,mobleys uhhh pretty good
pos,Neg,why is the picture lamelo
pos,Pos,apparently this tall ball works
neg,Neg,can you guys believe the warriors missed this guy in the draft had to take some dude named steph
pos,Pos,rubio curry killing hopes and dreams while looking like a super model
pos,Neg,sad bing bong noises
neg,Pos,yo i remember talking to some cavs fan in a thread before the season saying they d definitely win more than24 games
pos,Pos,imagine not drafting mobley on your fantasy team
pos,Neg,good win if you aren t watching the cavs play you should start
pos,Pos,ffs why couldn t we have just taken mobley
pos,Pos,rick and mobley six seasons and six chips and a movie
neg,Neg,rubio has some of that olympic energy still with him
neg,Neg,is this the best non lebron james season start for the cavs since like the 90s
neg,Pos,mobley literally anyone else
neg,Pos,vamos ricky
neg,Neg,riiiiiiiiicky ruuuuuubio
pos,Neg,mobley is the real deal
pos,Pos,i love basketball man

pos,Neg,lol rj sat the whole fourth this is your dude knicks defense is pretty ass
neg,Neg,we cannot be stopped
neg,Pos,what s up with colin sexton
pos,Pos,is rubio the best player the cavs have ever had
pos,Pos,the other day i was thinking about back when ricky rubio was a hyped up rookie i saw some knicks fan saying they couldn t wait to watch him drop dimes in madison square garden implying he d be a future knick i m going to convince myself this memory resurfacing is what brought this game on
neg,Pos,is rubio hof not kidding
pos,Neg,what the fuck
pos,Pos,the east runs through cleveland
pos,Neg,kevin love s is out indefinitely for health and safety protocols seemed to me like he was playing really well at the beginning of the season at least v the nugs anyway are the cavs better with or without him at this point are they gonna take it to another level when he returns or regress to the mean
neg,Pos,llllll
pos,Pos,jazz music stops
neg,Pos,jazz were clearly tired but fuck man we should have been able to hold that lead cole anthony is a baller and i feel like that was a character building win for the young magic squad
neg,Neg,i think people overreacted to cole s season at unc a tadddd too much guy was the best player in his class throughout the years and was in a horrible situation on his unc team also i respect him playing after he got injured not many of the top tier guys would do that
neg,Neg,magic are tanking the right way
pos,Pos,any lakers fans wanna dm me some excuses
neg,Pos,cole anthony
pos,Pos,wcj with a game high 19 in a close win give him his flowers
pos,Pos,cole anthony is an all star what a fucking ending
neg,Neg,don t compare cole anthony and payton pritchard again
neg,Pos,this is your weekly reminder that the orlando magic are in fact an actual nba team you may return to forgetting we exist thank you
neg,Pos,r j cold
pos,Neg,cole anthony is a mffing baller dude just did not want to let orlando lose this game his third quarter was incredible the back to back dunks in the court super impressive and he was just everywhere
pos,Pos,magic got some stone cold killers
neg,Neg,post cole anthony getting mvp chants
pos,Pos,hey chicago thanks for wcj and wagner
neg,Pos,love watching this team dope to see coach mo get his first home win cole anthony and wcj just a couple bad men love to see it
pos,Pos,cole anthony is a mad brotherfucker
pos,Pos,on the brightside if you lose to us you must be a great team or the t wolves
pos,Pos,if cole anthony doesn t slow down he might find himself on an all star team
pos,Pos,cole anthony is the real deal
pos,Pos,cole anthony is my favorite player on this team for sure and by far the funniest dude in the nba
pos,Neg,cole anthony is playing like a legit all star it s bananas
pos,Pos,also shoutout to wendell carter he s such a stud he plays excellent defense and now that he has the 3 ball down he s a legit stretch 2 way big he s everything magic fans think mo bamba is and this was actually a good mo bamba game also this was by far suggs worst game even on defense he looked lost chasing utahs shooters
pos,Pos,cole anthony is a bad mfer
pos,Pos,cole anthony is gonna be a star
pos,Pos,fuck i should ve waited till tomorrow to buy papa john s with discount code magicwin instead of getting one for this game
pos,Pos,just magic things
pos,Pos,thank you magic
pos,Pos,in cole anthony we trust
pos,Pos,cole anthony is your favorite players favorite player
pos,Pos,cole world
pos,Neg,i found out last night that cole anthony is greg anthony s son from 2k22 s in game commentary
pos,Neg,cole anthony is averaging 20 7 5 in his second year he could be the superstar orlando has been missing since dwight
neg,Pos,thanks magic for giving our 1 seed more comfort
pos,Pos,holy upset
pos,Pos,god bless young energetic nba teams they re impossible to root against
pos,Pos,wait wtf how
neg,Pos,boy they made some incredible plays
pos,Pos,cole world
pos,Pos,cole anthony is pure bde
pos,Pos,goat cole owns mormons
pos,Pos,did anything good come from putting the ball in mitchell s hands down the stretch for the jazz i guess the one assist to gobert but mitchell was bad in this one
pos,Pos,jazz gambled for the steal at the end which if you look at it percentage wise isn t really that bad of a gamble the other was to foul or play hard defense which both are kind of garbage more importantly though the magic just countered it with classic pass to an open shooter and at that point it s a make or miss league
neg,Neg,gary harris played good defense on mitchell yet again haven t watched the game but can see big minutes played
pos,Pos,damn magic
pos,Pos,i m quitting espn streak
pos,Pos,the west s best can t beat the least of the east
pos,Pos,how do you shoot 12 fuckin 3 s if you aren t hitting
pos,Pos,fuck these new balls we ve gone from one of the best 3 point shooting teams of all time to shooting under 32 as a team really sucks they implemented this change after we retooled our roster around 3 point shooting if things don t get better snyder is gonna have to re think the whole offense
pos,Neg,utah had 2 15 pt quarters wow
pos,Neg,i did not see that coming
pos,Pos,fantastic game by myles 22 and 5 blocks
pos,Pos,pacers keeping their head above water while brogdan is out is huge
pos,Neg,tj mcconnell is the man he is making the most of his increased opportunities this year
pos,Pos,what in the everloving fuck was that last shot from sacramento
pos,Pos,argh we could have had that game neither team played super well but the kings should have pulled it out at home shoutout to our defense for making mcconnell look like prime kyrie there
pos,Pos,pacers will move themselves back into the picture now that they re healthy shame the east looks tough this year
neg,Pos,solid move taking buddy out in clutch time to let fox stink up the offense nice luke hof playcalling remember when everyone thought you were good when you coached one of the best teams in history for a little while oh and nice inbounds play with 2 5 seconds left have everyone just go to the other end of the court for a hail mary don t have buddy streak and try to catch on the run for a decent shot or anything it s not like he literally did that at the end of the 1st god i can t stand this coach
pos,Pos,god that was so frustrating pacers played hard but christ game was there for the taking and we missed so many good shots nobody could get their shot going tonight especially that first half hovered around 35 shooting all night
pos,Pos,fox and holmes played like shit this game we re ten games in and fox has played well in 2 of them if ya ll puzzled about hali s last shot barnes was the first option but couldn t get open holmes got hali a good look and wide open shot and he bricked it horribly edit we also haven t won a game with mark jones commentating 0 3 with him lol
pos,Pos,looks like fox stinks this year thank god they deemed him untouchable
pos,Neg,bradley beal fucking hates milwaukee
neg,Neg,welcome to the denitentiary
pos,Pos,we demand to be taken seriously
pos,Pos,deni with the team high 10 he was a difference maker
neg,Pos,thank you lakers
pos,Pos,welcome to deni s how may we serve you today
pos,Pos,damn wizards looking great again this year that trade was really good for them solid players around beal who can score and play good defense is definitely a winning strategy
neg,Neg,deni avdija might be the best defender of all time no i do not need to explain
pos,Pos,deni avdija is an elite defender and yall cant convince me otherwise
pos,Pos,wiz bed
pos,Pos,whole squad is buying into what wes unseld jr is bringing and this is while dinwiddie still taking his time to gel can t wait for tb to come back
pos,Pos,the gafford trade was as big a steal as the lakers trade don t me
pos,Pos,the d in bed stands for deni
neg,Pos,i really don t understand the hate some people had for the dinwiddie deal that dude can play and is a good number 2 and holy crap the haul for westbrook is insane
pos,Pos,deni all defense avdija is here
pos,Pos,fresh sheets on the bed tonight
pos,Pos,i pre ordered my finals tickets
neg,Pos,damn wizards are actually kinda nice
pos,Pos,god damn giannis played 39 minutes bucks really wanted that win
pos,Pos,beal deadass happy he can score 30 and win lmao
pos,Pos,deni is the goat don t me
pos,Neg,i m so f ing impressed by this team gotta say though even when he has an amazing game and he did beal almost goes out of his way to blow it in the closing minutes of games by dribbling off his own feet i ve never seen a player of his caliber dribble off their feet so often
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,kuzman gets paid
pos,Pos,never thought i d see us win a game with our defense deni is blossoming into a future all nba defense type player just wish beal were better in the clutch early returns on wes unseld have been massive should be the favorite for coty at this point
neg,Neg,giannis is being overworked i know we have injuries and we want to win games but playing him 39 mins is not ideal he has to carry a ton of defensive and offensive load single handedly
neg,Neg,prepare the wizards bed don t change the sheets
pos,Pos,oooh don t mind me just thinking about that thread earlier today about who is gonna make the playoffs in the east
pos,Pos,deni draymond green avdija
pos,Pos,the wizards made out like bandits in that westbrook trade they look like an actual basketball team this year
pos,Pos,when the wizards win i say yes
neg,Neg,wizards bed now everyone get in
pos,Neg,i m going to overreact real quick that thread yesterday about who isn t going to make the playoffs out of the east full of delusional celtics and raptors fans is going to look real stupid this season
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,we fuckin in the wizards bed tonight boys
pos,Pos,wiz are so nice
neg,Pos,imagine lebron and ad on this wizards team
pos,Pos,we fucking
neg,Pos,brook come back
neg,Pos,we fuckin
pos,Pos,gotta start calling deni the iron dome because nothings getting through him
neg,Pos,tank commander giannis antetokoumpo leading the bucks to the lottery pick
pos,Pos,wiz fuckin in the bed again
pos,Pos,said this last sunday and i m still saying it this sunday i have no idea who s good lol
pos,Pos,people keep sleeping on us
pos,Neg,lakers right now
neg,Neg,curious how rui fits into the rotation once he s back
pos,Pos,bed springs getting broken wizards bed getting such a workout that we are going to need to invest in one with better support
neg,Neg,there s some positive signs to take out of this but it s been 10 games and i want the team back
neg,Pos,giannis gonna get some reflection time in the deni tentiary tonight
pos,Pos,harrell kuz eating the east up
pos,Pos,how you like this lob city music
pos,Pos,i love the wiz and we are playing amazing but the disrespect the bucks are getting is wild they literally don t have brook or middleton relax
pos,Pos,thanks lakers
pos,Pos,bradley beal once again kills us
neg,Neg,great win for the wizards but jesus what we re the lakers thinking
neg,Neg,can giannis carry a team s
neg,Neg,despite the win
neg,Pos,ted cruz taking another l
pos,Neg,bud s rotations are garbage playing midget g league lineups in the 1st half jrue threw the game at the end he has hurt the team on offense more than he has helped he has been awful since he has come back but it is understandable since he is still very rusty hopefully he improves quickly george hill is beyond washed
neg,Neg,bradley beal and jrue holiday really out there competing who s better at throwing games those last two minutes no lead is safe for the wizards when beal is consistently the ball handler at crunch time
pos,Pos,bucks have a worse record then la yet nobody bats an eye
pos,Neg,and people laughed at my idea that the nets and the bucks will play each other in the first round this bucks team got significantly worse this off season and didn t seem to catch the idea that other teams got better
neg,Pos,i don t want to hate on giannis but these looks like more usual giannis than this year giannis i know i m reaching a bit the ft i heard debi play good d on him props to him tho don t mind if i say wiz are spooky and bucks need lopez so bad
neg,Neg,the east is nuts rn
neg,Pos,out of the loop what s up with the bucks so far this year injuries
pos,Pos,i feel bad for the team thats gonna play us in the play in game fully healthy
pos,Neg,deni adiva really gets more respect from the refs than giannis
pos,Pos,i can t stand adam silver freakin alien vampire hybrid rewarding champions with no off season
pos,Pos,how the fuck are the bucks under 50
pos,Pos,this season has been so odd
pos,Pos,how can you not be the lakers and still lose smh
pos,Pos,spurs better get a top 5 pick at the end of this i love most of the guys on this team but this is brutal
neg,Neg,the moose is loose
pos,Pos,giddey s decision making seriously impresses me
neg,Neg,the true greats can just decide they aren t gonna lose sometimes jordan kobe lebron muscala
pos,Pos,please stop i can t handle the 6th pick again
pos,Neg,churros for bancero
pos,Pos,other than that disaster vs the rockets the thunder have been pretty fun this season they re becoming the comeback kids
neg,Pos,san antonio la lakers spurs
pos,Pos,okc finna get that play in spot and take la out lmao
neg,Neg,tank you very much okc
pos,Pos,you had one job spurs
pos,Neg,wait we won i don t think this is correct the national media has been talking about this team being worse than the process sixers and an embarrassment to the league if we won that would put us at the 6th worst record in the league and that just doesn t seem to match with what the media has been saying like they ve singled us out as blatantly tanking and not mentioned any other teams so this post game thread must just be wrong gg on the win spurs
pos,Pos,im not even mad i feel a kinship with okc both being young teams trying to figure it out we re not getting blown out in our loses so hopefully we are just a few pieces away from not sucking maybe its primo maybe its banchero i ll take both
pos,Pos,thunder about to fuck up their tank again
neg,Neg,kind of weird beating a team that isn t the lakers
pos,Pos,too good too tank
pos,Pos,hey spurs you weren t supposed to do that
pos,Pos,embarrassment to the league
pos,Neg,what an abortion of a game
pos,Pos,the murray magical midrange machine was not working tonight it s hard for us to win when he doesn t shoot well our teams are actually very similar both are led by dynamic point guards with tons of young guys and a couple vet big men thad young and favors y all just got more draft picks than us lol gg y all are gonna be great in a few years also this is our fourth loss by 5 or less 2 weeks into the goddamn season come on man
neg,Neg,the mike muscala game he was an absolute flame thrower in that 2nd quarter
neg,Pos,seriously im so sick of us losing all these close games we should be 8th 9th or 10th right now this is ridiculous credit to the thunder though they always play to win
pos,Pos,the road to 76 6 begins now
pos,Pos,can someone please explain why the hell pop didn t call a timeout
neg,Pos,holy shit doug mcdermott is still in the league
pos,Pos,i m not gonna lie boys it s getting really fucking hard watching this team if you actually watch us play and not look at the box score we look like a g league team sometimes airballing 3s turning the ball over in the stupidest ways no rebounding no effort i m not used to this i m used to getting a clean offensive possession with td manu tony and kawhi fuck this is rough i don t even wanna follow the nba anymore
pos,Pos,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray
pos,Pos,as a bama guy i m upset primo isn t getting any minutes if he was just gonna get stuck in the g league i wish he would have stayed for one more tournament run
neg,Pos,spurs need to schedule more games against the magic asap
pos,Pos,lmaoo this thread is hilarious jokes aside i hope i never experience how it feels to be a fan of a tanking team
pos,Pos,one of the most ridiculously officiated games i ve ever seen zero fouls for the spurs to 13 at the half 2 18 at the 4th our guys just stopped even driving because they d hacked hard as fuck by two guys with no call the fact this was even a game is a testament to how well they shot in the first half because the jumpers stopped falling and this team looked like shit i m all for losing but i wanna lose a fair game the officiating was horrifically one sided
pos,Pos,damn moose
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,the spurs should have blown that shit up 3 years ago they just kind of backed their way in to a tank
pos,Pos,some people might want their team to tank as far as i m concerned i won t be watching the team anymore as long as this disgusting brand of basketball continues we led pretty much the entire first half by double digits only to throw the game away like this
pos,Neg,that pick gonna be so good
neg,Neg,at least we re tanking we look fucking awful
pos,Pos,play jock or shoot me into the sun
pos,Pos,really lost to some aussie timothy chalmant looking ass dude fml
pos,Neg,spurs are super streaky from 3 i get they love the midrange since it shoots a lot of their players but holy shit it ll be tough to win gams on the road against anyone when you are cant stretch the floor as the game gets tighter theree is only so much your defense can do
pos,Pos,gpii is must watch tv
neg,Neg,i don t watch the warriors enough to know why the fuck did the mitten get so good out of nowhere what s different
pos,Neg,warriors back to being their former 15 selves once klay returns its all hands on deck
pos,Pos,can t wait to see this warriors team full strength
pos,Pos,the warriors are both scary and fun again and i m here for it
neg,Pos,gary payton ii
pos,Pos,so this is just what jordan poole does now
pos,Pos,jp 9 fta tonight that s great
pos,Pos,why am i looking more forward to gsw s bench than the starters
pos,Pos,yeah jack daniels is the appropriate sponsor for the rockets post game show
pos,Neg,the only word i can think of to describe the warriors is discipline absolute masters of the ball movement and selfless basketball 5 players with double digit numbers and 50 pts by the bench
neg,Pos,bold prediction christian wood is gonna get traded by the deadline decent player but doesn t fit the timeline looked pretty disengaged
pos,Pos,wwwwlwwwwarriors
neg,Neg,wiggins really checked back in during garbage time to try and get his 17 lol
pos,Neg,last season for the warriors is slowly starting to feel like some awful fever dream
pos,Pos,y all the warriors are stupid deep that s without klay and wiseman even playing strength in numbers is back
neg,Pos,steph is shooting badly relatively speaking and the warriors are still killing it can t wait to see what s gonna happen once steph goes back to his mvp level
neg,Pos,very happy that road trip is over i really liked the way we competed in the first half hopefully we can carry that sort of performance into some winnable games coming up
pos,Neg,i ve been saying gary payton the 2nd was better than lebron for like 8 years
pos,Pos,can somebody just upload that entire 3rd quarter lmao
pos,Pos,gp2 has michael jordan hops it s so bizarre to spectate
pos,Pos,my goodness i love how this roaster is built sucks that queese is not available as a two way since i much prefer him over chioza
pos,Neg,the amount of times i had to watch that dude say a prayer just to miss a free throw
neg,Pos,looks like i should figure out a way to get wood off my fantasy team
neg,Pos,ok i am here to overreact but jp might be an all star level guard
pos,Pos,wiggins really is the best 3rd scoring option the warriors has had since run tmc i aint including the kd warriors that shit was a cheatcode
pos,Pos,poole with 25 points again damn the preseason is so long this year
pos,Pos,we deeper than pacific this year
pos,Pos,gp2 is a legitimate difference maker on this team
neg,Neg,steph scored 0 in the 4th what a bum
pos,Pos,this man had this post ready
neg,Neg,warriors deep
neg,Pos,did christian wood play in this game i totally forgot he was on the rockets until our commentator mentioned how invisible he was
pos,Neg,gary payton is playing out of his mind lately team high 27 in 19 minutes
pos,Pos,so good
pos,Pos,so glad we kept gp2 he is awesome
neg,Neg,chris chorizo almost singlehandedly made it a game again yikes almost squandered that sequence where opj basically built the lead by going on a personal 9 0 run or something
neg,Pos,i thank god for bjelica and opj also why didn t jokum didn t play more minutes in the blowout
pos,Pos,the real question is who is better right now herro or poole best rivalry in the nba
pos,Pos,strength in numbers babyyy
pos,Pos,tate is a goddamn beast
pos,Pos,they re gonna be in the finals this year aren t they
neg,Neg,jordan poole got 9 free throws the game after iguodala said his next step is getting to the line hmm
pos,Pos,that bench unit with gp2 at power forward and bjeli at shooting guard is pretty fun
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,crazy how most of the hot warriors highlights these past games are of the bench gsw this season is deep strength in numbers indeed
neg,Neg,poole payton wtf
pos,Neg,this golden state team really reminds me of 2014 spurs in terms of playstyle and every man up type of mentality
neg,Pos,poole party
pos,Pos,i feel dray is being more aggressive offensively this year
pos,Pos,i straight up think draymond has been our best player so far this year dude has been absolutely locked in
neg,Pos,absolutely garbage refeering
neg,Neg,warriors looked a lot more sloppy today especially defensively but a w is a w although the real test for this season starts from tomorrow s game
pos,Pos,don t look now but they re on the same pace as the 73 9 warriors
pos,Pos,what s wild is since the roster construction has finally ironed out double teaming steph so much isn t the greatest plan right now lol everyone s moving constantly creating more openings while steph is pulling the defence towards him the one play i keep remembering was where two defenders tried to pin steph near the left elbow he makes the pass people keep moving and they keep pinging the ball around and find a wide open shooter for a three the problem with steph is how much he moves but now the whole damn team is replicating this it s amazing to watch
pos,Pos,at some point people are going to have to admit that steve kerr is doing an amazing job
pos,Neg,love the motion offence till now gp2 keeps impressing and opj bjeli doing their thing poole party goes on 2 things to take note of 1 need more iso pnr plays to get steph into shooting and scoring rhythm can t have passive steph for the playoffs 2 definitely need better paint defence in the non dray mins hope wiseman can cure that
neg,Pos,that 3rd quarter run was so much fun to watch
neg,Neg,hot damn i just had to hold myself screaming in my cubicle during the 3rd quarter felt like watching basketball porn
pos,Pos,someone should ask christian wood about the matchups tonight
pos,Pos,is jordan poole the best player on the warriors
pos,Neg,as a warriors fan seeing them win like this without curry playing his best is a really good sign
pos,Pos,when was the last time a player went from fighting for a roster spot to being a key rotation player
pos,Pos,way too many fouls gave em 20 free points other than we played a great game even most of our team shot bad players continue to step up and contribute we played our full roster again
pos,Pos,sheeeeesh
pos,Pos,kenyon martin has a kid in the nba
pos,Pos,three jr s in one game also what s the record for the number of porter jrs in the league at any one time
pos,Pos,gp2 is what marcus smart used to be to his team
neg,Neg,go warriors strength in everybody played and nobody 30 min either and oh wait rockets wanna get in on that action too it s contagious
pos,Pos,poole telling klay to rest up
neg,Neg,box plus minus is weird porter was so important in this game he went 5 6 from 3pt range and the three 3s that he scored in a row completely killed the rockets momentum and basically sealed the win but then he s a minus 3 for the game
neg,Neg,i almost kinda want steph to sit now what the fuck
neg,Neg,who needs steph curry when you have jordan steph curry poole
pos,Pos,there goes poole
pos,Pos,meanwhile klay is almost back from the chamber
neg,Neg,i love how even when wiggins shoots crap from 3 he somehow gets 8 free throws and keeps hitting his obligatory 16 18 points most consistent player on the squad
pos,Pos,the league is gonna be fucked when klay comes back
pos,Neg,fucking curry couldn t drop 40 or atleast 30pts wow well i guess fuuuuuck me then and fuck my fantasy team thanks obama
pos,Pos,i m just gonna say it but warriors are quietly the title favorite
pos,Pos,didn t think a team would yank this early in the year but here we are
pos,Pos,29 minutes 9 points for the second overall pick oof
neg,Pos,out of curiosity why don t kuminga and moody get more minutes as high draft picks is this just a regular way of building them up to it over time
pos,Neg,more importantly the warriors covered the 12 5 with a missed layup by the rockets at the end
pos,Pos,forget 73 9 warriors here comes 81 1 warriors
pos,Pos,how oh how is houston doing worse than okc not again lol
pos,Pos,gonna be a looooong season
pos,Pos,its happening again someone stop them quick
pos,Pos,rockets win this if paul doesn t get hurt and you all know it
neg,Pos,free christian wood
pos,Pos,just 2 seasons ago the rockets were 1st and warriors were last now it s the opposite and the rockets fans were saying we finally beat the warriors
pos,Pos,this jalen green dude
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,im skeptical about stephs shooting
pos,Pos,man who gave this an award
pos,Pos,fuck the astros
neg,Pos,
neg,Neg,draymond tackling kpj because he blocked his shot
neg,Pos,a must watch match up both teams are good
pos,Pos,oh white people
neg,Pos,idk who the announcers are but the fact that they started announcing the end of the game like a wwe match made the hornets total collapse so much better honestly goat tier commetating
pos,Pos,i love terance mann
neg,Neg,charlotte first 3 quarters hornets charlotte 4th quarter bobcats
pos,Pos,22 0 run to go from up 9 to down 13 fuck me sideways
pos,Pos,the clippers sea biscuit shit is driving me nuts its like they need to be down to come back and win a game its crazy
neg,Neg,i hate north carolina sports
pos,Pos,losing that way really has to sting for the hornets
pos,Pos,mann and luke went from competing for minutes to being a deadly duo
pos,Pos,someone on the clips needs to slap pg and tell him he needs to chill with the stupid passes hes my guy but that shit is his biggest weakness especially on a team where ball movement is so critical
pos,Neg,we went on a 22 0 run
neg,Neg,when the clippers get the w i get a little chubby dude
pos,Pos,entire hornets organisation needs to do prison time for those last 7 minutes
pos,Pos,i understand it s a home game but leave bledsoe on the bus and lock the doors hornets scored 4 points in the last 7 minutes luke nukem earning his bad contract
neg,Pos,what an epic collapse lol
pos,Pos,cool hand luke is quickly becoming one my favorite shooters in our team history and mann s dunks is inching closer to blake dunks for at least blake more impressive but the way mann blake made me feel during dunks it is similar
pos,Pos,ty lue has a thing of coming back down
pos,Pos,clippers starting to look better it s encouraging for them that they could win a game where pg was pretty inconsistent in the first few games he was basically the whole team
pos,Pos,4 straight wins my dude is chubby
pos,Neg,gg charlotte bros bridges and melo are so dope
pos,Pos,making a pledge to not watch another hornets game until they win it s just constant frustration see y all in december
neg,Pos,hornets gonna be extra hungry against the lakers
neg,Neg,it was weird to see the hornets collapse like that in the 4th
pos,Pos,that wasn t fun
pos,Pos,clippers are really clawing their way out of the hole they put themselves in at the beginning of the season they re a tough team
pos,Pos,ty lue gunning for coach of the year
pos,Pos,wait what last i saw they were down big with like 6 mins left
pos,Pos,that defense effort by the clippers in the final 6 minutes was a thing of beauty funnelling everything into big zu and he was deterring everything
pos,Pos,pg is turning the ball over way way too much he s going to piss away his shot at mvp contention if he isn t careful
pos,Neg,put boston in place of bledsoe s minutes
pos,Pos,poor hornets are getting a california beat down
pos,Pos,22 0 run and this subreddit can t upvote it lamelo love pg hate is just too strong
pos,Pos,i like the hornets watch them a lot cause they re my friends team my god they re wildly inconsistent on offence and hardly visible on defence
neg,Neg,mj took the fourth quarter personally
pos,Pos,22 0 run to end the game borrego is out of his depth and needs to go we fall apart at the first sign of adversity and the only consistent factor for this team is the complete lack of defense all of mitch s signings this offseason have been an abject disaster and we literally would have been better just doing nothing but whatever 2k auto sim recommends whoever told plumlee to do more jokic things needs to be fired immediately lmfao nothing like an 0 6 road trip in the third week of the season to unofficially end your team s hopes of a playoff push
neg,Pos,the hornets have been fooling everybody with fancy highlights they are actually really shit
pos,Pos,need to bench scary terry love him but a downhill since his return
pos,Pos,clips woke up
pos,Pos,lets go cleeeeips
pos,Neg,i hope somehow this energy transfers to the lakers clippers have done pretty well without kawhi i think they ve redeemed themselves after the disappointing end to the bubble
neg,Neg,bench terry for kelly
pos,Pos,last year jb could hide his poor rotations under the guise of rebuilding there s no excuse this year he just doesn t know his personnel
pos,Pos,lamickey ball choking the lead smh s
pos,Pos,im gonna kms
pos,Pos,i dislike lamelo but he s actually playing with a lot more poise than i expected
pos,Pos,did plumlee switch with his brother what the hell
neg,Pos,pg with 8 turnovers tho ouch i think he plays way better in away games maybe gets distracted playing at home
neg,Neg,one day we will play at full strength maybe can t wait until the annual gastroenteritis bug goes through the team
pos,Pos,prime andre drummond with 25 boards
pos,Pos,while in philadelphia up 11 with less than a minute to go in the 4th quarter if the knicks lose this game i ll walk back to new york myself walt clyde frazier took the words right out of my mouth clyde but fortunately we won tonight so no depression for knicks fans right now
pos,Neg,how were we in that game lol
pos,Pos,randle is a heck of a player makes some frustrating decisions but i ll be damned if he didn t respond every time we made a push down the stretch drummond is one of the strangest players i ve ever watched but man 25 rebounds dude is hustling out there no question nice to see maxey taking more threes and hitting them at that a couple a game adds a lot to the offense good win for the knicks with the team missing this many players to protocols i can t really complain about the result good effort good game on to the next one
pos,Pos,it s a ridiculous thing to say but that loss just confirmed to me this sixers team is better than last years last year they fold in the 2nd quarter down 18 if we can actually get something legit for simmons the sky s the limit as far as i m concerned
pos,Pos,sixers bench is pretty good no doubt they re the 1st seed duuuuude we re so inconsistent
pos,Neg,drummond with the casual 25 rebounds
neg,Pos,i can t believe a fan actually threw a toy ball at kemba
pos,Pos,randle carried in the last 5 minutes of this game
neg,Pos,andre drummond s last 7 games against the knicks today 76ers 14 points 25 rebounds 37 minutes may 18 2021 lakers 16 points 18 rebounds 3 assists 35 minutes april 12 2021 lakers 4 points 4 rebounds 25 minutes january 29 2021 cavaliers 4 points 15 rebounds 2 assists 24 minutes during the time where andre drummond would get decreased minutes that eventually transitioned into a buyout january 15 2021 cavaliers 33 points 23 rebounds 3 assists 39 minutes december 29 2020 cavaliers 18 points 17 rebounds 2 assists 6 blocks 33 minutes november 6 2019 pistons 27 points 12 rebounds 7 assists 35 minutes luckily we won tonight but man this dude loves going off against us and tortures mah boi mitchell robinson all the damn time x_x
neg,Neg,lowercase yerrr
pos,Pos,gg knicks pretty happy the kind of performance it took from randle to get by us maxey milton korkmaz niang drummond is super fun curry and danny are great steadiers too
neg,Pos,i m amazed the sixers were even in the game they looked completely gassed having played so many short handed games need to back up against the bucks tomorrow as well neither team played all that well but fought hard
pos,Pos,dear sir or madam
neg,Neg,the covid i976ers tried as hard as they could not enough horses gg knicks
pos,Pos,honestly not a pretty game for the knicks but i ll take it
pos,Pos,this embiid fellow seems pretty important to the 76ers
pos,Neg,pleasantly surprised with the toughness and resiliency of this sixers team they have been playing without their 3 top players but still find a way to compete with a really good knicks team
pos,Pos,ok knicks you ve had your honeymoon period welcome to the atlantic spite bowl i hate you all way too many in the wfc tonight
pos,Pos,also good game knicks y all are fun team and i can t wait to play you guys at 100
pos,Pos,sixers were really impressive tonight your team has heart and doesn t give up we came so close to blowing this one that i can t feel great about the win but at the end of the day a win is a win and randle came alive in a big way so that was good to see entertaining game all around
pos,Pos,it doesn t say much about the knicks that they didn t completely blow us out
neg,Neg,damn that was a close game ya love to see it
pos,Pos,where were you when you leaned niang is somehow a menace driving to the basket and steph turkey has the quickest trigger in the league frustrating game as randle shut down any 4th quarter comeback attempt but was fun nonetheless
pos,Neg,damn doc running his all bench lineups again
neg,Neg,good heavens
pos,Pos,no embiid no tobias no simmons it s still a 1 point game well into the 4th quarter god we suck
pos,Pos,i know i can t be that mad when we had 8 players and none of our stars but man we really should have won that what a fun and deep team we have
pos,Pos,gg live with it
pos,Pos,with 2 minutes left randle is sizing up niang after being on a heater and kemba does the jump up and down with your arms up thing to seem like he deserves the ball in crunch time because he made one floater this was randle s crunch time and kemba better not pull that sh t in the playoffs i am not a knicks fan but players and fans can tell who s crunch time it is and this was not kemba s btw kemba missed another high floater bank shot over drummond
pos,Neg,damn this six squad doesnt give up
pos,Pos,what a random 25 rebound performance bruh get it together for real
pos,Pos,both teams had the same number of fgs and 3pas i don t know why i find that amusing
pos,Pos,honestly just happy we made that a game
pos,Pos,man i just love maxey he s playing his goddam heart out
pos,Pos,there will come a game where both julius and rj play really well someday
pos,Pos,no one bing bongs us but us bing bong
neg,Neg,every night this team turns me into howie ratner for better or worse
pos,Pos,juuuuuuuulius
pos,Pos,gg
neg,Pos,looks like the knicks will now run 14 straight against the sixers gg knicks randle went nuclear at the end
pos,Pos,congrats to the knicks for defeating the 8 sixers
pos,Neg,fuck adam silver
neg,Neg,lol randle flexing near the end running into barrett and getting floored immediately
pos,Pos,all this hype about the sixers and after playing them i just don t see it they put up a fight but they re clearly at least a few major pieces away from actually going anywhere disappointed
neg,Neg,comical offense by sixers without joel just four shooters passing in a semicircle until one of them jacks a shot
neg,Neg,the refs were fucking horrible tonight lmao someone post that goaltend or that leg kick by seth lmfao missing 2 best players and tisse and we were still in the game until the end
pos,Pos,yerrrrrrrrrrrr
pos,Pos,i think we re a playoff team i don t know if we re a confident playoff team definitely feels like in a best of series it could get ugly but we have plenty of season left to adjust
neg,Neg,lmao the amount of knicks fans coming to the sixers subreddit after the 11th game of the season when we re missing almost all of our key players is stupidly embarrassing
pos,Pos,which dumb front office do you think we can offload shake milton to someone out there still has to think he s good
pos,Pos,good game
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,the knicks were really celebrating like they won a game 7 instead of beating the sixers without their three best players lol
pos,Pos,i m not trying to start anything but i had to watch the philly broadcast youtube tv doesn t have msg and i just have to say that the guy commentator for the sixers is god awful
neg,Neg,smoking on that sixers pack tonight
pos,Pos,this knicks team is so good
neg,Pos,this could have just been about philly fighting hard in a game where they were short staffed but then you get philly fans throwing shit just to remind you why philly tears always taste the sweetest not sure why anybody in the crowd was that salty over what should have been an easy loss but whatever lol hope they beat the traffic
pos,Pos,sorry bout dat l bozo
pos,Pos,randle is a total black hole but sometimes black holes end up scoring points
pos,Pos,no embiid big problem
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,4th quarter bulls at it again
neg,Neg,bulls are legit harden was ass today
pos,Pos,holy shit that 4th quarter or the bulls
pos,Pos,do the bulls have the best 4th quarter offense in the league
pos,Pos,4th quarter bulls are something else
neg,Pos,i love ayo so much hometown kid
pos,Pos,the bulls scored four 3s before the 4th and 5 in the 4th also ayo might fuck around and make all rookie haha jk unless
pos,Pos,hey derozan haters why are you so queit now
pos,Pos,them dosunmu minutes made my dick hard
pos,Pos,ayo with a 22 in 19 minutes almost 10 points higher than anybody else on the team
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,lol we just died in the 4th quarter gg bulls
neg,Pos,how did ayo fall to the 2nd round
pos,Pos,like everyone else i predicted the bulls having two top 5 scorers this far into the season
neg,Pos,i love the bulls and i don t care what anyone thinks
pos,Pos,all i see is red drive home safely chicago beep beep
neg,Neg,ayo dosunmu
pos,Pos,demarvelous derozan
neg,Pos,is this the best durant has ever been in his career even in the nets losses his numbers are insanely good
pos,Pos,wtf bulls are gonna be a problem it feels like 2010 again
neg,Pos,in a battle between ex spurs demar derozan triumphs over patty mills and lamarcus aldridge 118 95
pos,Pos,ayo would be roty on a bad team
pos,Pos,thank you bulls for making me forget about this horrible bears game
pos,Pos,fuck the east is rough this year
pos,Pos,it s comical that ayo fell to us in the second round he s gonna be a sixth man of the year candidate soon
pos,Pos,talk about russ buddy kuz and kcp all you want the only objectively clear mistake the lakers made with no logical justification is letting caruso go one of the dumbest moves i ve ever seen a sports team make in years he s a great bench piece he s not pricey and he s a fairly popular nba star what s not to want he alone doesn t win a ring for la but he makes it a lot easier just utterly stupid of jeanie buss to save tax money and hypocritical especially after saying she d spare no expense to win coulda made more money by winning another ring with labron and having another young mainstream name on the roster thank god he went to the newly good bulls at least good on them for signing him
pos,Pos,how the fuck did the league let us have ayo
pos,Neg,unstoppabulls
pos,Pos,ayo is cold we got a first round player in the second round
pos,Pos,bulls won t even need coby white much at all if ayo dosunmu keeps going off goddamn
pos,Pos,wow ayo was such a steal at 38 he has been so so so important off the bench that youthful rookie energy just flows to everyone who shares the floor with him
neg,Pos,my dream ecf is bulls vs knicks
neg,Pos,pain
pos,Pos,this team built different lets fucking go
pos,Pos,ayo s energy was so contagious tonight some incredible hustle great rebounds and it really just felt like every time he was on the floor we made a run i love this rook
neg,Pos,we re going to the superbowl
pos,Pos,the bulls own the 4th quarter
pos,Pos,da bulls
neg,Pos,the bulls dominated the 4th quarter this teams hustle is special
neg,Pos,that 4th q sequence where ayo lonzo and demar hit threes from the same side corner in back to back to back possessions was absolutely orgasmic lonzo s three was so effortless holy shit
pos,Pos,the bulls announcers are so fun to listen to
pos,Pos,ay gtfo hollinger with your wackass vlookup analysis
neg,Pos,i m so happy to have 1 team in chicago that s good
pos,Pos,man those bulls wins keep looking better
pos,Pos,bulls are legit
neg,Neg,nephews really thought that demar would play on the mle and the bulls would be a bottom 5 defense
neg,Neg,4th quarter bulls strike again
pos,Pos,what the fuck happened in the fourth quarter
pos,Pos,this team fucks
neg,Neg,every 4th quarter teams have to face the 96 bulls apparently
pos,Pos,not sure exactly what it is but the bulls really struggle in the first half of games or at least for a full quarter of the first if they figure that out they re going to be pretty dangerous with how they ve been playing in the second half
neg,Pos,if demar keeps this up all season and the bulls finish top 2 3 in the east give him the mvp seriously the narrative is there
pos,Neg,durant dropping 30s and still not winning he about to take his mannequin ass and beat down kyrie tonight
neg,Neg,good win for the bulls op what is that username
pos,Neg,i should have watched this instead of the bears
pos,Neg,understandable loss team ended up being too gassed down the stretch and the bulls hit their shots
neg,Pos,this is the best bulls team since d rose 2011 mvp season
neg,Neg,harden was nonexistent tonight
neg,Pos,demar be ballin boi
neg,Neg,the one thing i ll takeaway from this game is blake griffin has the flattest arc i ve ever seen
neg,Neg,man that chicago team is something serious
pos,Pos,i don t know what happened in the fourth quarter but i am here for it
neg,Neg,dosunmu i came to bargain
neg,Neg,it s all good road b2bs are a bitch
pos,Neg,look past the box score this was an important game for vucevic he missed a wide open 3 foot floater in the first quarter and got booed by the crowd he deadass didn t look at the rim for what seemed like the rest of the game until the fourth hit an open three and two more buckets off of pick and rolls in the fourth we need him to score i m glad be was able to finish this game off by hitting those open shots this sounds stupid but we re so much better when he s a scoring threat
neg,Neg,derozan said fuck the three and just became better at what he already was good at 2 years before spurs trade 41 5 from 10ft 3pnt line 47 from 3 10ft last 2 years including the games so far this year 46 from 10 3pnt line and 50 from 3 10ft kd almost always goes left sometimes going right he looks awkward kinda wild teams still let him easily go left
neg,Neg,gimmethehotsauce
pos,Pos,of the sea of the rozan
pos,Pos,that 4 wing and a real center lineup is working well
neg,Neg,bulls are legit
pos,Pos,bulls blow it out for 20 points just like that damn
neg,Neg,what the fuck happened to harden
pos,Pos,deebo unleashed
neg,Neg,a y o
pos,Pos,ayo dosunmu
pos,Neg,love seeing javonte crush it
pos,Neg,solid bulls team wonder how far they ll go this year
pos,Pos,bulls fans how s my boy lonzo doing
pos,Pos,went to this game in person it was wild the fourth quarter went hard as a bulls fan definitely a night i ll never forget
neg,Pos,bulls heat nets sixers is going to be a playoff bloodbath
pos,Pos,best bulls team of all time who says no
neg,Neg,lol 4th quarter
neg,Neg,is nba tv broken for anyone else every other channel works for me
neg,Neg,lemme hear you say ayooooooo
pos,Neg,what s up with harden damn to go from an almost 30 ppg guy to 18 even with the new rules
pos,Neg,bruce brown out there running around for 30 minutes
pos,Pos,summary bulls are a great team aldridge looks good kd is the best player in the league
pos,Pos,was back up in the nosebleeds tonight great effort in the 4th to pull away ayo caruso can do no wrong in chicago right now watching kd cook in person was honestly a pleasure huge w lfg
pos,Pos,man coby pat will and now ayo we ve done so well in the draft these past few years
neg,Neg,watched the game on the high seas and my god do the nets have the biggest homers in the booth they bitched about the hook call and many others what a screen from bown when every one had been an illegal screen it was unreal
pos,Pos,22 for kd wow
neg,Neg,kings of the 4th quarter bulls good lord
neg,Neg,haven t watched many nets games does harden have the yips or is he out of shape or what
pos,Pos,can t wait for q3 warriors vs q4 bulls
neg,Pos,so harden is averaging 18 3 points on 39 9 shooting well looks like he s still adjusting to the new rules
neg,Neg,like the guy next to me was screaming all night their third guy wants to be an instagram model but the bulls have all 12 guys who are dogs debazach
pos,Pos,harden not getting a couple calls for game doesn t take away from the fact that he s been awful for most of the season
neg,Pos,seeing harden not getting every call brings a smile to my face
pos,Neg,james harden simps in shambles after just declaring he was back
pos,Neg,we ll still be behind the nets in espn power rankings
pos,Pos,james harden lmfao
neg,Pos,
neg,Pos,the bulls are good and legit but playoff derozan will show up guarantee it
neg,Neg,even though the refs gave them a few extra calls towards the end they were still dropping bombs in that 4th quarter they got a solid little squad in chicago now it s going to be fun to see how far they go this season
neg,Neg,we could have won this one but the team was clearly gassed from the b2b kd was the only one that could hit anything props to the bulls for playing hard in the 2nd half on another note our defensive rating is gonna take a big hit after that shocking 1st and 4th quarter lmao
pos,Neg,kat gonna scream into a pillow when he gets home
pos,Pos,is next year s draft any good
neg,Pos,i think god himself hates the timberwolves
pos,Pos,no way on any part of the earth should memphis have won that game we were dead in the dirt to start the fourth terrible selfish basketball by wolves in the fourth particularly russel just jacked up shot after shot without forcing our pretty bad defense to defend
pos,Pos,ja morant
pos,Pos,if i know one thing about slides here in minnesota it could go from three to 18 to 19 20 really quick kat ain t lying is it just me or kat and ant have 0 chemistry
pos,Neg,great game for brandon clarke that was a rollercoaster of emotions
neg,Pos,shouldn t have ever come to that tying shot and then they lose in ot the last 3 minutes of regulation were a season worst choke job by minny
pos,Pos,really happy for clarke he s been a good professional for us and fell out of the rotation
neg,Neg,how do you get two generational big men in the draft as a franchise and win a grand total of two playoff series between the two of them
pos,Pos,ja morant is a superstar what else can you say about the kid in that trae young tier at least
neg,Pos,ja morant additionally brandon clarke
pos,Pos,this is brandon clarke s world we re just living in it
pos,Pos,so you guys been watching the wild this year lots of fun stuff happening over there
neg,Neg,is there a better coach team pairing than bearded jenkins and the grizzlies
pos,Pos,this team just constantly finds new ways to make themselves look even more pathetic than they already were i feel like kat is just never a guiding force down the stretch it s always turnovers or bad shots or getting frustrated on defense and never just putting his head down and getting a bucket he was nonexistent down the stretch when the grizzlies went on that run he just has to be more consistent than that we can t build this team around him and have him disappear for these periods
neg,Pos,i ve stopped watching wolves games my mental health is better off
pos,Neg,kat and ja gonna get all the spotlight this game but the real star was brandon clarke
pos,Neg,jjj had a brutal first 3 quarters but he made up for it big time in the 4th and early in ot with two big stops on kat ja morant also did his usual thing late in the 4th which is just takeover if you are not watching the grizzlies you should be they re not only a good team but a fun team to watch
neg,Neg,wolves getting more more creative in losing lol
pos,Pos,beating the wolves without dillon brooks who is a wolves killer is shocking clarke had a great bounce back game happy to see him play well
pos,Pos,i don t like basketball anymore
pos,Neg,this is a good honest 600 basketball team we play 600 ball goddammit salt of the earth punch the clock even win loss ratio basketball we lose a couple guess what we win a couple too but we never get too excited or let it go to our head no long winning streaks here no sir that s hubris which this blue collar hard working everyman team doesn t have a few wins in a row these guys true to form balances it out with a couple a losses yes sir this is my 2021 22 grizzlies a good honest 600 basketball team you thought i was gonna say 500 huh psych not tonight bitch in all seriousness wow what a game we were up 9 in the 3rd and then fuck that up to go down 11 at the start of the 4th down 16 with 7 30 left to go we then claw back forced misses blocks by jjj rebounds then there was a whole bunch of turnover calls we were close to clutching the game in regular time but kat then makes an insane buzzer beater but we wrapped it up in ot gg wp timbs what a fricking game last time as well was insane with ant scoring 42 ja bc ran the show melt jjj slowmo bane helped clutched it
neg,Pos,so that late 8 second call against the grizzlies doesn t the clock have to hit 15
neg,Neg,brandon clarke had himself a game he was huge in ot after jaren fouled out with multiple boards and buckets
pos,Pos,this is the first time i ve watched the wolves this season do they always look that brainless
neg,Neg,grizzlies 5 had a 1 chance of covering with 1 30 left and it covered i will never miss another grizzlies timberwolves matchup
neg,Pos,can t lie bit of a wacky one tonight
pos,Pos,was very nice of kat to forget he was the one who sent the game to ot
pos,Pos,watching the timberwolves is like watching a baby drive a car except the baby has a license
neg,Pos,what a drunk game
pos,Neg,ja morant in the fourth quarter showed y all what he is about
pos,Pos,one team that knows how to win in the clutch and one team that doesn t yet
neg,Neg,can t leave the door open with ja co around
pos,Pos,i mentioned this in the game thread but i m still waiting for the wolves to figure out what they have in patrick beverly i know they got him for defense but he is a good starting point guard when he and edwards are on the floor together 4 5 times edwards takes it up the court and improvises something beverly knows how to run a play and take time and he isn t selfish with the ball he can read the court further patrick beverly can shoot currently he has the highest effective field goal percentage on the team and is second in 3p 43 compared to kat s 49 i like edwards but he s not a mature player
pos,Pos,the wolves are the definition of a black pill
neg,Neg,there is very little that is more depressing than the timberwolves wasting kat and anthony edward s time together
pos,Pos,taking orders for ja morant all star jerseys mention you are on r nba and get the nephews special of 50 extra added to your bill act quick while they still last
pos,Pos,the timberwolves lost a game exactly like this last year vs us where they were up 10 in the 4th idk whats wrong with those dudes
pos,Pos,that is a brutal loss
pos,Neg,ja morant i m on my grizzly
pos,Pos,free kat
pos,Neg,the wolves had negative bbiq at the end and it looked like no one really gave a shit about the game
neg,Pos,temetrius jamel morant let em know
pos,Pos,someone s definitely hacking kats twitter tonight
pos,Pos,free kat wasting his prime years
pos,Pos,wolves find new ways to put a knife in my heart
pos,Neg,can someone post that inbounds near the end of the 4th you know the one
neg,Pos,da fuq happened to the wolves thought they were looking spooky to start the season
pos,Pos,man just like that crazy luka three against the blazers in his rookie season it just sucks that kat s buzzer beater wasn t for the lead
neg,Pos,man no other sports team is like this expect the vikings maybe the twins fml
pos,Pos,who the hell got blocked by patrick beverley
pos,Pos,kat s gone
pos,Pos,what happened with steven adams looks like he got completely cooked
pos,Pos,i m going to get downvoted because he s the darling of this sub but anthony edwards really needs to learn how to play winning basketball the wolves will never win anything with him shooting that many shots this inefficiently
pos,Neg,removed
pos,Pos,good the grizz deserved to win this game wtf was that 5 second call
pos,Pos,free kat
pos,Pos,just fucking move us to seattle i can t take another 20 years of this shit
neg,Pos,the wolves are too good to trade for simmons tbh
pos,Neg,people are blaming kat ant and dlo but i think it s clearly a coaching issue the timberwolves offense was pretty much have them take turns isoing with literally no offball movement kat ant dlo are all talented offensive players but you are not going to play winning efficient basketball if they are just taking turns driving at 3 defenders it is the coaches job to create a system that utilizes his player s talents and that clearly isn t happening don t blame the players blame the coach that has them playing this hideous offensive system
neg,Neg,i love that smell smells like another losing timberwolves season
pos,Neg,and then there was 2 who will lose on the road first the raps or warriors probably raps in boston no way they let us get over them in their building
neg,Neg,wolves need a leader cause this is def what happens to teams without one it ain t kat or dlo that s for sure maybe ant in 2 or 3 more years or if kat leaves
pos,Pos,what is closing out teams minnesota sports teams
neg,Pos,of you ever thought about being a timberwolves fan don t
pos,Neg,my expectations are never high but boy do i hope we have a better record than last season either that or kat takes the kg love route and get something more out of his career than this
pos,Pos,minnesota blew it for sure i had lost hope as a grizz fan down 14 but i d prefer to focus on ja huge dunk and 3 down the stretch of regulation nor to mention an insane cross court assist to melton mid air in ot i still have no idea how he saw him on the opposite baseline
pos,Neg,same old wolves
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,poverty franchise
pos,Pos,i feel the wolves should be better than their record they have a really good set of players tbh
neg,Neg,bruh we suck
neg,Neg,oh boy that was tough for the wolves id say good luck but i dont think they d know what to do with it
pos,Neg,i shattered a coffee mug against my wall this morning it s just so hard to find the will to keep getting out of bed in the morning with the team playing like this i feel so irritable and on edge nearly all of the time lately we are all in this together though
pos,Pos,why is everyone shitting on the wolves the game went to ot and the grizzlies are really good and have a superstar player people just wanna get easy updonks by making fun of the wolves the season has barely even started yet
pos,Pos,pelicans had 0 blocked shots i don t know if that is an habitual stat or not
pos,Pos,i know its fun to say we re a shitty 7 3 team but we ve pulled these games out and taken care of business which wasnt always the case for us
neg,Pos,man this sucks i m so stressed right now in life and i just wanna enjoy my basketball team playing well to decompress after a long day i just go to bed more pissed
pos,Pos,jalen brunson is our 2nd best player and it s not close
pos,Pos,jalen brunson is so good
neg,Neg,frank ntilikina
pos,Neg,say what you want about strength of schedule but i m taking 7 3 all day you can only play who s on your schedule
neg,Neg,jalen with a 26 my goodness
neg,Neg,i like how kidd is molding this team very unselfish good ass defense and letting our stars shine for the most part
neg,Pos,here s your dallas mavs post game summary now in our 6th season 6 damn this post game thrad took a while to get posted did the mavs win glad we didn t let that one slip away there at the end don t let the score fool you this game was a lot closer than the score would say but also not close this game really had everything from being a 4 game for 75 and a blowout got 20 luka with a solid though quiet game for him tonight with 25 5 5 kp only had 12 8 3 tonight but if you watched the game you d know he scored some of if not the biggest points of the first half to get the mavs the lead and stay in front for the rest of the game and then hit a big 3 in the late 4th to keep us above water timmy with 17 6 4 tonight on good shooting sinking 4 3 s bench analysis brunson burner continues his 6moty campaign tonight with 17 4 6 to lead the bench in scoring 6 reggie with a nice 12pts with 2 3 s frank with a solid 9 3 2 2 steals to round out the bench production
pos,Pos,let s all say it right now jalen brunson for 6moty
pos,Pos,if kidd decides to stop having powell play any quality minutes we get a lot better
neg,Neg,ngl i did not expect the pels to do a full blown tank this year
pos,Pos,just where did dwight powell ever get the idea that he should shoot threes
pos,Pos,all this kidd doomer panic and here we are with mavs 7 3

pos,Pos,jokic vs morris wrestlemania
pos,Pos,holy shit lowry almost 38 mins and nothing
neg,Neg,i am looking at lowry s statline and the first number i am seeing is a zero is this correct
pos,Neg,what i think will be interesting to see is how the referee s call will effect any suspensions because the call on the court ended up being flagrant 2 by morris and unsportsmanlike conduct deserving of an ejection by jokic so the referees felt that the contact by morris was deserving of a flagrant 2 and most players understandably get pissed when a flagrant 2 happens to them i am not condoning jokic s actions and believe he should probably be suspended
neg,Pos,i don t condone the retaliation by joker but if the nba allows these enforcer types to exist in the league like the morris twins have for their entire careers then they have to expect someone to respond to all the cheap and dirty plays
neg,Neg,to everyone only shitting on jokic while ignoring that morris tackled him first get bent morris fucked around and found out if more players handled dirty fouls like that maybe dirty ass players like the morris brothers would learn their lesson
neg,Neg,shame it ended the way it did because despite the loss i was having fun up until then gg nuggets hopefully our next game is a bit calmer
neg,Pos,i mean look here taking a hard elbow to the ribs isnt just an everyday foul it was literally a flagrant 2 what you expect someone to just smile and laugh after getting elbowed in the ribs obviously id prefer if jokic was not suspended but he isnt going to stand there and let people elbow him half the people in this thread talking backing up morris would do the exact same thing if they were jokic
neg,Pos,morris absolutely flew into jokics ribs with his elbow why jokic was in the air for no reason and got his flagrant 2 not flagrant 1 but 2 it was not jokic that started the altercation so stop acting like morris did not get what he deserved he is a dirty player and everybody knows it i am actually happy to see jokic dishing out what morris needed the man don t take no shit i respect that he didn t start it but he finished it
pos,Pos,fuck the morris twins
pos,Pos,kyle lowry lowlights incoming 0 accuracy
pos,Pos,wtf lowry scored 0
neg,Neg,death taxes and a morris twin being a little bitch what else is new
pos,Pos,jokic bodied the heat out there
neg,Pos,will barton is going to have to average 50 pts a game when jokic is inevitably suspended
pos,Pos,jokic getting elbowed in the ribs is somehow less of an assault than getting pushed wtf am i reading in this thread
pos,Pos,i m not gonna excuse what jokic did because it was real bad but you better blame morris as well because what he did would have leveled a smaller man especially in a blowout with 3 minutes left
pos,Pos,damn this was a crazy good game by jokic until the foul man
pos,Pos,what is jokic supposed to do there after that hard and cheap check just take that hard check from morris like a bitch fuck that i support it jokic mvp
pos,Pos,this should be civil
pos,Pos,probably the best the nuggets have looked all season let s keep this up bois
neg,Pos,jokic does have a temper you don t want to mess with him and after all of it however morris gets up and walks off the court just another acting job jokic did hit him hard but that was just acting mostly morris threw himself down on the ground like jokic killed him refs gave them both equal punishment they saw it as equally guilty i doubt anything comes of it morris is not even hurt stretcher was there because of the acting not because they needed one
pos,Neg,morris deserved it and i love jimmy but he needs to stfu acting like he s gonna do something to jokic in the locker room
pos,Pos,nuggets swept the floor with the heat today don t let that get overshadowed missing mpj and murray
pos,Pos,removed
pos,Pos,morris is such a dirty player
pos,Pos,well i ll take the win but i d rather it not end like that jokic has gotta keep his composure you can t claim to be the leader and then do this gg s heat bros our next matchup will be interesting to say the least
pos,Pos,unrelated fun stat i just noticed during the game tyler herro averages more fga per game than lamelo ball jimmy butler nikola jokic karl anthony towns fred vanvleet jordan clarkson joel embiid and james harden
neg,Neg,i mean
neg,Pos,i know the ejections will overshadow the performance by jokic but he really dominated both ends of the floor he s locked in on defense and getting everything he can out of his body on that end
neg,Pos,noones gonna talk about this but will barton s been low key amazing
neg,Pos,heat culture strikes again
pos,Neg,jokic did what he had to do
pos,Pos,i am just sad that this jokic masterclass will go under the radar because of the bitch move by him absolutely sonned bam on both ends of the floor
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,thats a dirty foul by morris if you think jokic is wrong for standing up to bully then you need a help
neg,Neg,jokic is the absolute man for that morris is dirty af
pos,Pos,thing is it would have never happened if morris had not cheap shotted jokic just put that in your memory banks but maybe you people don t think people should stand up for themselves
neg,Neg,
neg,Pos,man i m not sure jokic learned anything from game 4 against the suns hopefully he gets in better control we will miss him for whatever the suspension is
neg,Pos,the nuggets and absolutely dogwalking the heat immediately after losing a star player name a more dynamic duo
pos,Pos,there s that great heat culture we all love
pos,Pos,i was loving everything jokic was doing this game on both ends of the floor and won the day against a center in bam adebayo who regularly gives giannis and other top big men indescribable fits and then he goes ahead and commits the stupidest retaliation foul i ve ever seen and almost guarantees himself a suspension and or fine
pos,Pos,haslem gonna check in next game just to fight jokic and dip
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i just realised denver s home court is called ball arena lmao creative as
pos,Pos,all these heat fans coming in here saying fuck jokic is hilarious to me while down double digits with 2 minutes left in the game your guy flagrant 2s jokic with a shot in the ribs and knee to knee contact on his standing leg that he just injured then tries to walk away like it was nothing that s the bitch move here don t walk away like that and you don t get a shot to the back better yet don t commit a pointless dirty foul when the game is over and this game ends with no hiccups jokic even admits he overreacted but y all need to recognize your dude is a dirty player and brought that on himself don t stick up for that shit like a bunch of clowns heat culture is about working hard and playing tough not playing dirty like a bunch of sore losers
pos,Pos,fuck morris dirty piece of shit go get what you deserve bozo
pos,Pos,markieff morris be stayin salty
pos,Pos,not a good move by jokic but morris shouldn t have turned his back if your going to hit someone hit them and get into it with them i have no idea why he turns his back to jokic knowing how mad he gets lol but people lose their cool and jokic should have known better
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,as a nuggets fan embarrassed by jokic s flagrant shots to the back are weak shit that being said i wonder if this will be the end of the morris brothers taking cheap shots themselves to summarize yikes
pos,Pos,ayo rip morris but im different me n jokic would go toe to toe
pos,Pos,
neg,Neg,people better be just as up in arms over jokic doing that shit as they were when bev pushed cp3 in the back that was dirty af but i m sure people will push this shit under the rug in about 6 hours cause it s jokic vs a morris twin
pos,Pos,i want jokic to accidentally rip morris head off and dunk it for the game winner
pos,Neg,lot of tough guys with denver flairs out tonight but regardless of what team you support you gotta admit denver fans chanting mvp after jokic shoved morris is not a good look
neg,Neg,removed
neg,Pos,damn cam payne first and now morris starting to see a trend here
neg,Pos,that was one of the dirtiest and softest plays i have ever seen minimum 10 games at least also stay classy nuggets fans morris is a fucking idiot morris shouldn t have fouled that hard he earned that shot lmfao they bringing out the stretcher for this pussy lmfaoooooooooo fk him up yes he asked for it lol honestly love it wasn t necessary but we all know markieff that was totally warranted fuck that asshole triple double and a dead morris brother pretty good stat line all in all jokic fucked his shit up good fucking pussy honestly this is a classic case of you reap what you sow glad this fucking cunt got his shit rocked dude got what was coming to him
pos,Neg,fuck jokic
neg,Pos,denver was the better team but what a weak ass move by jokic if you didn t like the foul tell him something shove him to his face waiting till he turns around to cheap shot someone as hard as u can is a weak move
pos,Pos,fun to read the comments on jokics dirty play vs something like pat bevs push on cp3 in the playoffs such a difference
neg,Neg,imagine the scrutiny simmons or westbrook would get if they dropped 0 3 4 with 3 turnovers in 38 minutes
pos,Neg,my only issue is joker could clearly see morris coming jokic hit him at full speed when his back was turned that s what made it a bitch ass move
pos,Pos,he had it coming to him yes he deserves an elbow from a jokic size person to the spine s
pos,Pos,they better rest him next game
pos,Neg,someone s getting ejected in this next matchup lmao
pos,Neg,i foresee ud playing in the next nugget game
pos,Pos,not like this
pos,Neg,happy the sixers didn t trade maxey for lowry
pos,Pos,nah fuck that bring that shit to the back
neg,Neg,the real tyler herro
neg,Pos,neither one should be suspended imho maybe a fine
pos,Pos,green on pf looked good for nuggets perhaps better than with mpj
pos,Neg,when jimmy isn t all up in arms when the opponent hit you he knows you deserve it
pos,Neg,and now we miss multiple games from a mvp candidate in jokic because bitch ass morris got all emotional that he laid a beat down on the heat morris may need to come up with a convenient injury before the next match up or the joker is gonna body them
neg,Pos,next time just hug jokic i am sure he likes hugs
neg,Neg,the more and more you get exposed to nugget fans the more you start to realize that they re a bottom 2 fanbase in the league
neg,Pos,well if you are going to lose and go to 7 3 this was definitely the most appropriate way to do it one could say it was heat culture now to be serious here for a second i understand why jokic was so mad because we were about to come back in that game towards the end we were winning the 4th quarter and about to shut the nuggets down
pos,Pos,at minimum should be a 5 game suspension
pos,Pos,nothing like showing how tough you are by shoulder tackling a guy from behind shit s gonna go down in miami next time these two play
neg,Neg,people will still try to discredit kerr his system is the most entertaining system in the game
neg,Neg,the box score won t show it but curry played excellent defense this game so that s a 50 10 7 with excellent defense imo one of curry s best games ever
pos,Neg,curry on the second half of a back to back hits different
pos,Pos,should the nba be worried about steph curry
neg,Pos,wtf has kerr been saying to these guys in the locker room at halftime
pos,Pos,ugh here we go again welcome to the fucking show
pos,Pos,whether it be wilson spalding nike hairy saggy it s all the same to steph there s levels to this shit
pos,Pos,horror i never want to play steph again
neg,Neg,he really saves his shooting for this night huh what a skyfucker
pos,Neg,steph is a stat padder and i fucking love it
pos,Pos,welp warriors really are back don t know what klay is going to look like but this team healthy is fucking scary
pos,Pos,warriors down 15 please call ambulance warriors after q3 but not for me
neg,Pos,
neg,Pos,warriors might be the most synergistic team i ve ever watched their ability to convert offense to defense and defense to offense is literally unparalleled they feed so well enough off one another which allows them to go on runs at a moments notice curry is a fucking alien from another galaxy no human should be that good at shooting basketballs let alone be able to drive finish pass create screen and play solid d masterful performance on another note this warriors team is fucking scary rn hawks are a good matchup against them back half of a b2b and they found a way to grind out a win against a good hawks team hawks had a really good offensive game plan for the 1st half but got suckered into a shoot out in the 2nd half hawks decided to leave steph in single coverage most of the game using hunter huerter reddish as the primary defenders didnt work this is why teams double steph once he gets in a rhythm its so damn hard to stop him jta deserves a shoutout hit some clutch ass 3 s and played good d jk had a really nice 1q debut some nice moments mixed with lots of rookie mistakes his individual defense is impressive though
pos,Pos,side note i feel bad for red velvet curry really huert him this game
pos,Pos,jesus christ curry with the first 50 point game of the season no surprise to anybody lol
pos,Pos,so this stephen guy is pretty solid huh
pos,Neg,steph has finally fucked the sky fr this time
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,we going 73 wait i heard the cavaliers are playing well in the east will hold off the 2016 reference for now
pos,Pos,wwwwlwwwwwarriors steph mvp
pos,Pos,warriors turning every 3rd quarter into a blowout again
pos,Pos,what s going on in atlanta i haven t watched a game since they dominated us
neg,Neg,curry went up to trae after halftime tapped his side saying you had a nice game young fella trae looked up thinking what it s only the third quarter
neg,Pos,did steph blatantly statpad to get the 50 yes do i care nope should he do it again the very next chance he gets absolutely
neg,Neg,no way warriors start 9 1 no way warriors radio got no chill
neg,Neg,this dubs lineup is so ridiculously entertaining
neg,Neg,this team brings me so much joy man
neg,Neg,i ve never seen kerr keep curry in for that long when the game is already over lol
pos,Pos,of course curry has to step up his game since both star players jordan poole and gary payton iii had an off night
neg,Neg,death taxes and the third quarter warriors baby
pos,Neg,lol curry really played an extra 3 minutes to get to 50
pos,Pos,can i get a to everyone who was dooming and glooming when we were down by 15 y all were some absolute children smh
pos,Pos,they can t keep getting away with this narrator they kept getting away with it
neg,Pos,i respect trae and the hawks but the hawks announcer that was salty at curry staying in for 50 needs to keep that energy when trae gets a 50 piece homers i guess
neg,Pos,steph is just next level
pos,Pos,3rd quarter warriors on par with batman with prep time they can literally maul anyone
pos,Pos,i hope he cracks at least 70 wearing that wilt uniform
neg,Pos,steph was saving this mode for a decent team
pos,Pos,klay is coming guys
pos,Pos,gp2 with the casual 2 points and second best 22 dude plays hard and i love it
pos,Pos,yes he fucks the sky but he also fucks my heart
pos,Neg,third quarter warriors so lethal amazing game from the squad wtf was that hawks announcer meltdown
neg,Pos,trae young only had like 7 in the second half gp2 locked that ass up
pos,Pos,i think steph read all the and steph s not even playing that well comments and decided the sky needed some fucking
pos,Neg,9 1 and they re still missing 2 starters btw
pos,Pos,people still sleeping on a 9 1 team why strength of schedule i m not saying they re winning 90 of their games moving forward but they ain t no slouches contender s baby get ready they should be ranked on all these power rankings
pos,Pos,nothing better than a lights out stephen curry performance w the 50 piece and 10 assists plus his defense has been really intense this season
neg,Pos,i will never forget how angry people were this off season that we were wasting curry s prime with this roster
pos,Pos,i love the warriors without kd
pos,Pos,getting to witness curry play every night is a treasure man is unbelievable
pos,Neg,the warriors might never lose again when klay comes back
neg,Neg,steph has to be the mvp by any metric
neg,Pos,damn this team is so fun to watch
pos,Pos,shutting the league the fuck up one game at a time
pos,Pos,what the fuck is up with our 3rd quarters bro
pos,Pos,steph with his ultra instinct unleashed fucking skyfucker
pos,Pos,so is kerr a good coach
neg,Neg,surprised that the hawks didn t double curry
neg,Pos,this steph guy is kinda alright
pos,Neg,war dpoy stephen curry
pos,Pos,haha curry a great shooter let alone player well to be perfectly honest in my humble opinion of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view but also by looking at this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of one s view and by trying to make it objective and by considering each and everyone s valid opinion i honestly believe i completely forgot what i was going to say
pos,Pos,50 10 7 on 50 shooting 10 3pt mvp
pos,Pos,curry went so crazy celebrating that i was scared he d get a heart attack
pos,Pos,john collins only had 7 shot attempts fucking seven
neg,Neg,are third quarter warriors a fucking problem again yes
neg,Neg,guess who s back back back again 3rd quarter warriors are back to fuck up the league again
pos,Pos,but who have they played say the haters
pos,Pos,as much as i loved having kd this team is just so much more fun to watch without his iso game
pos,Pos,ok fine steph curry still best curry
neg,Neg,for those who aren t familiar warriors getting dunked in the 2nd quarter and coming back with a ridiculous 3rd quarter is par for the course this year warriors team by quarter along with ranking 1st quarter 3 8 6th 2nd quarter 2 8 25th 3rd quarter 9 4 1st the 2nd place team has a 4 4 for the 3rd quarter 9 4 is freaking ridiculous 4th quarter 3 6 2nd
pos,Pos,who cares that curry had 50 he was an mvp and has won championships smh
pos,Pos,who s next
pos,Pos,can someone tell me what s going on with the hawks haven t watched them this year
neg,Neg,is it time to be concerned about the warriors
pos,Neg,i have a serious question is any team not named grizzlies even going to defeat this team
pos,Pos,the haters can suck my ass everyone bow to the skyfucker
pos,Pos,third quarter warriors led by the skyfucker warriors are back
neg,Pos,the warriors are so fun to watch
pos,Pos,this team still has klay lmao
pos,Pos,mvp szn baby
pos,Pos,amazing how good the warriors are when jordan poole gets help
pos,Pos,3rd quarter warriors
pos,Pos,what a comeback that 2nd half by the warriors was something else great to see a big game from steph
neg,Neg,steph has gotta be the front runner for mvp so far
pos,Pos,what a third quarter
pos,Neg,curry is in real mvp form this year
pos,Pos,can any real basketball expert which i m not tell me what the warriors do to adjust that causes them to consistently perform so well in the 3rd quarter a phenomenon that appears somewhat consistent across several years now as in are they actually making visible adjustments to their lineup or the way they run their offense or defense in some way that is exceptional compared to other teams
pos,Pos,this was one of curry s best all round games he was on one in all aspects of the game
pos,Pos,i m just salty kuminga missed a free throw and we went 21 22
pos,Pos,there may come a time when the warriors lose a game again but today is not that day
pos,Pos,bring in some serious teams please steph is hungry
pos,Pos,i don t know man i see nate doing the same non sense that lloyd pierce was doing keeping in the bench for way too long and allowing the other teams starters to take the advantage not calling timeouts to cut the momentum no play calling jc barely touched the ball after an incredible first half what the hell is going on we look nothing like we did in the 2nd half of last year playoffs
pos,Pos,that end of the third was just brutal
pos,Pos,curry was on his jr swish tonight hitting all the ridiculous shot and missing the gimmes
pos,Pos,dread it run from it third quarter warriors still arrive
pos,Pos,gary payton and steph combining for 6 steals same as the whole atlanta team sheesh
pos,Neg,wardell gunning for his third mvp you love to see it
pos,Pos,if yall thought this was nice just wait until we play a good team s
neg,Pos,put the college fund on curry to win mvp parlay that with brady to win mvp and you set
neg,Neg,50 pts and 10 assists on 2 to steph what the fuck
neg,Neg,steph for dpoy
pos,Pos,death taxes warriors in the third quarter
pos,Pos,best player in the nba
neg,Pos,is this your eastern conference
neg,Neg,steph with a clean 50 piece nice
pos,Pos,steph curry
pos,Pos,imma sleep good
neg,Pos,are the warriors good again
neg,Neg,i d just like to address all the people who were talking shit in the second quarter and say lol suck it
pos,Pos,steph curry is just built different period and this entire game showed you why
pos,Neg,steph led the team or was tied for most in every stat on the team tonight lmao
pos,Pos,thank you steph
neg,Pos,this one was for andy liu
pos,Pos,3q warriors are back and here to stay
pos,Pos,you got to tip your hat
neg,Neg,what the fuck man
pos,Pos,this team is starting 9 1 and are still waiting to add klay back no other issues for him
pos,Pos,i m surprised the hawks didn t feed collins in the post more we had no answer for him
pos,Pos,hit the bookies where it hurts folks 3rd quarter warriors are back and 81 1 is on the table until it isn t
pos,Pos,gp² with 2nd highest and he fouled out and only scored 2 what a fucking stud
pos,Pos,and then you realize the warriors are missing their other hof shooter and young center long season but this team has 2015 2016 vibes except curry is somehow better
neg,Neg,gpii fouled out to a standing ovation guy become a fan favorite in less then 10 games
pos,Pos,man gg warriors curry is still curry and is terrifying that said what is going on with this team so far i expected them to be so much better than this this season and they have struggled really need the boys to start picking it up here the talent is there just gotta start winning games
neg,Pos,little worried about steph s shoulder tbh
pos,Neg,i know it s only ten games in but i m excited reminds me so much of the pre super team era and i love it
neg,Neg,it s a shame the regular season is too boring for the hawks
pos,Pos,nate mcmillan tricked y all man
pos,Pos,maybe i keep thinking about the steph comparisons but trae needs to move without the ball more he was killing the warriors the first half with his floaters but the warriors were hounding him and just denying him the ball 2nd half and he just stays in the back
neg,Neg,wonder how many people were waiting to say told you so at half before trae young s dad shut them up so inspirational
pos,Pos,lol and then the 3rd quarter happened
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,believe in threezus
neg,Pos,skyfucker
pos,Pos,too good
pos,Pos,klay hasn t even arrived to the party
pos,Pos,steph please stop sky
pos,Neg,is this curry guy getting even better this dude is not human
neg,Neg,looks like curry borrowed the 3rd quarter power from klay to win this man went super saiyan after half time
pos,Pos,dubs won t make playoffs
pos,Pos,steph saved all his chakra for a good team
pos,Pos,thank lord for steph no ones gonna talk about that 4th quarter tonight
pos,Pos,harrison barnes had a 93 9 ts
pos,Pos,its sad that the charge call and books steal will never be on this sub and yet he will still get a reputation as a negative lazy defender
pos,Neg,hey kings i think it s best if we start seeing other people
neg,Pos,despite what the score says this game was not close
pos,Pos,said it elsewhere but these damn purple bastards had to put me through a blowout and a narrow loss in the same game
neg,Pos,no we did not almost blow a 24 point lead in the 4th quarter nothing to see here
neg,Pos,people forget that the suns were second seed last season for a reason
pos,Pos,i just want a 20 or 30 point blowout game to calm my nerves man
pos,Pos,kings legit out choked us
pos,Pos,suns saw that kings 3rd quarter and was like hold my beer
pos,Pos,had to repost wrote kings record wrong really weird ending to that game
neg,Neg,never a dull game with the 2021 2022 phoenix suns
pos,Pos,people tell me dbook can t take that next step because he doesn t defend pass or rebound i must not be watching the same devin booker as them because he s does all of those very well cam payne is a top 5 backup pg in the league and it s not some oh good for him shit anymore dude is a problem mikal is a legitimate 40 3pt shooter nowadays and damn that s real nice lol javale mcgee was unironically one of the best signings of the off season exactly what the suns needed a stop gap when ayton isn t in the game rebounding defense rim protection very good finishing penalizing switches in the post and good screens when ayton isn t in the game damn isn t that nice thank god for that amazing 3rd quarter bc that 4th was rough opposite night i guess
pos,Pos,the kings playoff drought could legally acquire a driver learners permit in the state of california
pos,Pos,shut down seems generous
neg,Neg,suns lowkey might ve been better off late in the 4th if we just let the bench grind out the last 4 mins starters were cold when they came in
pos,Pos,we were playing great until the 4th q
neg,Pos,i turned it off suns up 18 and i check randomly and it s a one possession game lmfao
neg,Pos,the suns are allergic to winning comfortably
pos,Pos,is bagley really bad enough that chimezie metu and damian jones are getting minutes over him
pos,Pos,the king s are 0 4 with mark jones commentating maybe he was the problem
pos,Pos,everyone sleeping on the suns again this year lmao
pos,Pos,wow what a game
neg,Pos,monty tried to coach us out of that game
pos,Pos,live by buddy die by buddy
pos,Pos,same trash ass kings see y all after we get that playoff drought streak locked down
pos,Pos,anyone got a clip of cp3 getting the offensive foul for drawing contact on the fast break
pos,Pos,the kings turnovers man i don t know how many turnovers the kings committed in the first half but that third quarter really sucked the life out of the stadium i suppose it didn t help seeing so many jumpers miss but i loved seeing that defensive energy midway through the last quarter when you force turnovers and run you re fun but credit to paul to get that steadying alley pop to mcgee to make it 107 100 that was the clincher in the end oh and that booker charge was great suns 6 3 despite the hangover of the finals series is not bad
pos,Pos,where would the lakers be without carmelo
neg,Pos,i miss lebron watching lakers try to close a game is disgusting if the last shot is gonna be ad contest jumpers why not just go to melo
neg,Pos,this is my admission of guilt for thinking that carmelo anthony was ever washed post okc when he got traded around cut bought out a few times also though what the fuck was the end of that game lmao russel westbrook s brain farts per 36 stats are absolutely outrageous
pos,Pos,they may have had lamelo but we had la melo staples center melo is built different
pos,Pos,give up 5 free throws in a row because of 3 straight techs and it goes to ot
pos,Pos,melo has been our 3rd best player this season and it hasn t been particularly close his shooting has been so ridiculously clutch and automatic through these games we d probably have 7 8 losses without it
neg,Pos,melo for 6th man
pos,Pos,bad news we keep blowing huge leads good news we actually can build huge leads without lebron too hopefully when he comes back that stops
neg,Pos,carmelo anthony davis
pos,Pos,we need to stop getting rattled by the refs idk if this is a symptom of being a lebron led team or what but holy shit a call doesn t go our way and dudes lose their minds
pos,Pos,those techs almost cost us this game
pos,Pos,bazemore is the most unclutch player on this roster he s missed like 5 open layups the last week
pos,Pos,carmelo with 70 from 3 what a legend lamelo with a triple double the melos are taking over 2022
pos,Neg,ledad was about to lose it
neg,Neg,i think both lakers and hornets fans can agree that the refs sucked dick
pos,Pos,not tonight r nba
neg,Pos,it s funny the lakers essentially pulled the reverse of the clippers last night they played a pretty great game for three quarters and then started making seemingly 1000 mistakes in the fourth the five free throws was hilarious but also probably some bullshit for the refs to play such a major factor
pos,Pos,rondo won t get the game ball but he played some huge minutes
neg,Neg,another total collapse in the second half to cap off a 5 game losing streak we clawed back because the lakers decided to gift away fts but yeah we are already losing ground in our eternal race to finish 500 while going on six straight years in the lottery i m glad we decided to rebuild by near maxing out expensive injury prone role players who fail to show up every other game but at least the 25 million dollar man shot better than 25 from the field tonight our hc marked a top 15 defense as his primary goal for the season and we are dead last for a popp disciple it s pretty funny that his teams have seemingly 50 turnovers a game and no composure when things get tough also three defensive 3s in a single game like how is that even fucking possible
pos,Neg,for a team filled with veterans the lakers were really not able to keep their temper at all there are pieces and plays that work but the offense through westbrook needs to change because as it stands rondo seems like a better choice for a starter i still believe westbrook can make it work with the team this season but vogel and lebron really need to help him understand to play to his strengths cut down the risky passes and stop going for the 3s that team are daring him to take it s frustrating because you see flashes of how he could make his game work but then emotions get the best of him this season has barely started and with this style of play it has felt like an eternity only 71 more games to go
pos,Pos,tbf to westbrook while he had 7 to s if we look at the ones that were actually his fault then he really only had 11 to s
pos,Pos,how rondo 0 3 and 20 in under 12 minutes lol
pos,Pos,are the lakers even allowed to feel good about that one
pos,Pos,all lakers fans need to send melo some thank you cards
neg,Pos,lakers tried so hard to lose this game
neg,Neg,no matter what this lakers team is going to be very to watch
pos,Pos,lebrons face at the buzzer said it all shit was fucking cringe
pos,Pos,lakers offence is atrocious everyone just stands around
pos,Neg,i think the biggest problem for the lakers in this game was their attitude and focus could have wrapped up this game much sooner
pos,Pos,sorry to any neutral fans who watched this game
pos,Pos,this team might have 3 wins if melo wasn t going off some of these games
pos,Pos,that rondo flagrant 2 ruined that game regardless of the outcome
pos,Pos,carmelo was on fire the whole game and got iced out for god knows how long fucking congrats to westbrick though he got to pad his stats again
pos,Pos,melo is carrying this team lol russ has to come off the bench i don t think he ll ever do it but he d be so much better just getting to play his game without ruining the flow
pos,Pos,carmelo anthony
neg,Neg,im depressed
pos,Pos,this team is going to kill me
pos,Pos,lakers screaming about a totally random call for like ten minutes lamelo hahaha free throws go buzzzzzz
pos,Pos,that sequence where lamelo hit 5 free throws in a row and brought the hornets back in the game because the lakers got so many techs has to be the funniest thing i ve seen during a game in a while
pos,Neg,carmelo lost a year of his career when he s still got it
neg,Neg,how do you not foul on that last possession
pos,Pos,the lakers won but did they actually
pos,Pos,this probably isn t going to make sense but i ll give it a shot it seems like russ usually gets his stats triple doubles while the lakers win whereas lamelo lebron other players get their triple doubles to help their teams win
pos,Pos,i hate the lakers and especially ad but man he can hoop also something fun about old man melo just jacking threes off the bench every game
neg,Neg,battle of the dumpsters at staples interesting game tho lakers would have been like 0 11 without melo lol
pos,Pos,westbrook legit had the worst triple double ive ever seen absolutely unreal how we still snuck out a victory also we need to give rondo more minutes 20 in 12 min lol dude actually takes care of the ball and sets up guys
pos,Pos,game should ve ended in the 4th
pos,Pos,thank god it s over that 3rd quarter was so fun i thought we were just gonna roll into garbage time but naa we had to give the fans a show lol shoutout melo
pos,Pos,how do the lakers still have 4 more home games in a row lmao
pos,Pos,damn i really thought the hornets would pull that one out still yikes for the lakers in the 4th though
neg,Pos,lakers could have won in regulation if their team wasn t full of dummies
pos,Pos,lakers win despite all of westbricks best efforts to throw it
pos,Pos,bruh westbrook gotta fucking go
pos,Pos,that s not funny
pos,Pos,westbrook got his triple double and a win he can to sleep angry and talking shit like he always does
pos,Pos,watching carmelo playing like god is my only solace now lakers suck
neg,Neg,jesus christ
neg,Neg,stay me7o
pos,Pos,carmelo is turning back the clock
neg,Pos,choked hard
pos,Pos,ad is such a roller coaster to watch rn it gives me high blood pressure
pos,Pos,staples center melo is goated
pos,Pos,well the lakers won which means by r nba logic the hornets just aren t a good team sorry charlotte bros
pos,Pos,austin reaves is this years budget caruso ugly win but we needed it i m hopeful though i think things are starting to gel
pos,Pos,me7o deserves mvp conaiderations
pos,Pos,carmelo is a g
neg,Neg,this has to be the worst lebron team in terms of actual performance vs expected performance in his entire career
neg,Neg,the lakers are not a good team
pos,Pos,that 3rd quarter was inspiring then rondo got ejected and westbrook almost threw away the game
pos,Pos,road to champions 77 5
pos,Pos,and that completes the california sweep of the hornets who s the next team
neg,Neg,this whole team is a mess should not have even gone to ot fire westbrook into the fucking sun
pos,Pos,the lakers won despite westbrook
neg,Neg,real talk though they actually just need to get rid of russ
neg,Neg,lamelo pussy take the shot
pos,Pos,holy fuck westbrook is bad
pos,Pos,yo this game went from terrible to fucking amazing then back to terrible then amazing again russ i have no words for you
neg,Pos,pelinka is a clown not trading for lowry and traded for brodie instead cost the lakers a championship again
neg,Pos,nice to see lakers fans have already started to turn on westbrook 11 games into the season wait till the playoffs come
neg,Pos,carmelo been the lakers second best player this szn fuck ad bitch ass and westbrick
neg,Neg,without melo the lakers space the floor about as well as a travis scott concert
pos,Pos,lakers probably would have been better off running back the squad they had last year melo dwight my god russ was selling in that 4th quarter
neg,Neg,westbrook almost got a quadruple double again lol
neg,Neg,and russ was there too
pos,Pos,i feel like westbrook freezes out melo cuz melo took that 3rd spot in the big 3
pos,Pos,westbrook was infuriating to watch as usual don t even care if we still have to pay him and he sits so long as he sits he s just an indefensible mental midget but damn when melo bounced the inbound pass between the legs of the defender to monk who then hit the logo 3 at the buzzer almost made up for this game melo singlehandedly saving our season
pos,Neg,carmelo is like the only bright spot of this lakers roster
neg,Neg,melo being the best player on the lakers rn is uh concerning to say the least wb continues to play like ass turnstile on defense braindead on offense got that sweet triple double though why on earth did the lakers trade for him fo needs to come under some heat for this roster construction the lack of wings is confusing hornets starters are legit but that bench is sus af need to upgrade via trade definitely need a competent backup c miles bridges is legit but he needs to work on his defense why does ad keep trying to play like hes kd on offense your a center not a wing play like one do the lakers have an offensive system genuinely curious cuz from what i can tell they spam iso s and pnr almost at random lakers perimeter d is offensively bad each dude out their just gets broken down so easily it doesnt matter who the rim protector is if they re constantly hung out to dry theyll give up buckets hornets are on the back half of a b2b on the road and have more energy than the rest lakers
neg,Neg,please just excise westbrick from the lakers
pos,Pos,when an undrafted rookie is closing games for you in a season you are trying to win your offseason was a failure
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,well it s not over
pos,Pos,westbrook is truly running around like he pac
pos,Pos,everytime russ shoots i cringe everytime russ passes i cringe everytime russ dribbles i cringe
pos,Pos,this was like the lakers championship charlotte got manhandled by the clippers just yesterday lakers need ot and melo rondo to go off just to beat the same team
pos,Neg,almost threw the game with the 5 fts but holds on in ot lol
pos,Neg,why couldn t carmelo do this on okc
pos,Pos,thank you carmelo gg hornets
pos,Pos,rozier had some tunnel vision moments
pos,Pos,well that was a basketball game
pos,Pos,dennis scott have aids now
pos,Pos,carmelo is saving this team from disgrace
pos,Pos,how much worse would this team be without carmelo
pos,Pos,im still annoyed that rondo got ejected
pos,Pos,2003 nba draft carrying the lakers rn
pos,Pos,man the lakers love blowing big leads in the 4th quarter to the dumbest of reasons this time we lost a large lea because of 5 straight free throws lmfawe really gifted them 5 7free points in 1 minute l
pos,Pos,they are the exact opposite of a flowing offense i can t wait for lebron to come back so they can establish an identity melo can t keep saving this offense
pos,Pos,this shit was insane
pos,Pos,wtf were those 5 straight free throws i was just laughing cuz i did not know what was happening at all shoutout to melo his shooting has saved the season so far lakers need some better late game execution though i guess it ll get better with lbj
neg,Pos,great game even though the hornets lost lamelo needed to take that last shot
pos,Pos,can t believe that rondo ejection or the hayward out of bounds call wtf are these refs doing lol
pos,Pos,lakers offence is tough to watch sometimes
pos,Pos,carmellllllllo anthonyyyyy
pos,Pos,carmelo is unbelievable
pos,Pos,the big 3 of lebron ad and melo need some better role players
neg,Neg,the charlotte hornets took the lakers to overtime and only lost by three that s wild
pos,Pos,carmelo anthony is the greatest player in nba history
neg,Neg,if melo continues to play at this level has he got a better shot at 6moy over herro
pos,Neg,this team makes me sad
pos,Pos,good win
pos,Pos,lakers look pretty good with rondo yesshade
pos,Neg,westbrook is the raheem sterling of the lakers he can find a way to botch anything
neg,Neg,vogel has to go soon
neg,Neg,and nearly threw it away with that meltdown at the free throw line late in the 4th
pos,Pos,westbrook is playing horribly
neg,Neg,lakers looking at warriors beautiful basketball like wtf that should be us
pos,Pos,it s wild to me that out of all the players they added it s old as hell carmelo anthony who s bailing them out next to ad
pos,Pos,trade russ to a team that needs him where he can be the man because i don t think he ll mesh with the lakers or at least right now maybe fire vogel or something because his rotations but there s definitely some improvements needed
pos,Pos,magic had a point when he called westbrook the worst point guard ever terrible basketball iq and tried his best to give the game away
pos,Pos,refs couldn t win this one
pos,Pos,ad and russ tried their hardest to lose those last few seconds of the 4th glad they pulled through
pos,Pos,awful basketball awful reffing awful offense and defense this game really just sucks
pos,Pos,didn t watch it but westbrook got 17 12 12 pretty good game
pos,Pos,holy fuck russ is fucking terrible
neg,Pos,russ legit will run a 3on1 fast break and physically hand the ball to the 1 guy on d or just throw the ball into the 5th row of the stadium
neg,Pos,wb legit almost threw this game for us when we should ve ended it in a blowout going from rondo to westbrook was the most painful thing i ve seen this season from great plays to back to back to back tos and absolutely not flow on offense i ve always loved westbrook but i hate him on my team cut his minutes ffs
pos,Pos,bball paul will be a household name soon and maxey
pos,Pos,maxey is an amazing player reed can be a serious contributer sixers put a great fight just way to undermanned
pos,Pos,i figured out who bobby portis looks like now hear me out eminem
neg,Neg,that game had no business being that fun
pos,Pos,one hell of a game by the sixers without embiid it looked grim in the 4th
pos,Pos,grayson allen
pos,Pos,this game has to be really encouraging if you re a sixers fan they really battled with so many guys out and maxey looked like a star as a bucks fan grayson allen has looked great this year i love giannis and i m ready for khris and brook to come back
pos,Pos,ughhhhh man i ve been coming into these 6 man lineup games with zero expectations and then we always make it close and then i get invested lmfao at least maxey had a really incredible game super encouraging to watch
pos,Pos,such a great effort down so many players 5th game in 7 nights so proud
pos,Pos,so proud of this squad tonight off a b2b and against the defending champs love the chemistry keep simmons tf away from this group
pos,Pos,sixers were as gassed as kimbo slice and dada 5000 in the 4th every single shot was either short or a drummond tip in
pos,Pos,what the hell is your user op
neg,Pos,so maxey is basically 6 foot giannis
pos,Neg,hey can we talk about how dogshit reggie miller is dude called shake shake middleton and paul reed patrick numerous times also gg bucks grayson was a killer tonight
neg,Pos,gg 76ers y all kicked ass for being so depleted and maxey is incredible fuck the announcer for saying you need a pg when you have him
pos,Pos,damn sixers didn t have their finisher and look incredibly lethal honestly this sixers team looks mentally tougher than the last few years
pos,Neg,u brooklopezthedpoy in absolute shambles
neg,Neg,lol and ian eagle ends the broadcast by randomly bashing maxey and saying the sixers need a point guard trash broadcaster
pos,Pos,georges niang is the french tatum
neg,Pos,fuck i hate grayson allen he s a sniper
pos,Pos,gonna need a full series with these two teams with everyone healthy the game was such a fight the entire four quarters
pos,Pos,furkan coldmaz
neg,Pos,moral victories aren t a thing but the past two nights are moral victories our team is deep and when the starting 5 are back out there i expect very good things to happen
neg,Neg,hell of a game from the sixers
pos,Pos,how did this man giannis end with one foul
neg,Neg,niang gang til i die
neg,Neg,defeat the delaware blue coats lol
neg,Neg,great game all around this sixers squad is incredibly entertaining tyrese maxey could have been a top 10 pick gg bucks
neg,Pos,not a doc defender at all nor do i miss him but it s still really weird watching a doc rivers team embiid s supporting cast is one of the better and doc rivers ier squads i think i wouldn t underrate them
pos,Pos,this sixers team is too likeable man
pos,Neg,god damn it the bucks have made me like grayson allen
neg,Neg,this sixers team is a threat for a championship
pos,Pos,really impressive from the undermanned bucks did we mention that they were undermanned just checking
neg,Pos,there s a timeline where the bucks don t trade for grayson allen and in that timeline i would have stopped watching this team play basketball and lead a fulfilling happy life
pos,Pos,damn we really the most unlucky team in the league multiple very important and vaccinated players out with covid i guess atleast the bench is good
pos,Pos,maxey was a guy i liked a lot if the c s wanted to go with a potential kemba replacement during the 2020 draft so seeing him do well for the sixers is filling me with a lot of conflicting feelings
neg,Neg,ngl didn t expect grayson allen to be good in the nba lol
pos,Pos,how many alley oop attempt did the sixers stop by grabbing giannis 3 4 that s was kinda funny to watch if grayson allen keep it up his contract is a steal
pos,Pos,i m sure grayson allen is a really lovely guy but man i wanna punch him and his kate gosselin haircut in the face so bad
pos,Pos,bucks needed this as well any win without khris brook and donte will be taken grayson has been a good addition
neg,Pos,bucks needed that one more than philly did here s hoping the next matchup both squads are healthy maxey is a beast
pos,Pos,league and ready for a healthy sixers especially with a ben simmons feature or a post ben trade
pos,Pos,shaq is a sherif no he has to abide by the law
neg,Neg,i ve said it before and i ll say it again we are one ben simmons trade away from being legit contenders we ve never been this deep and competitive before
neg,Neg,damn maxey looked real good tonight i ve always been high on both him and quick but tyrese s second year jump has been beyond what i expected obviously defensively he ll never sniff simmons but offensively this kid is already really good and his aggressiveness is just what philly needs grayson allen too bucks bot their bogi esque player
neg,Pos,philly s got a nice deep bench
pos,Pos,sixers game it all and then giannis just said l will win the game
neg,Neg,league don t want this smoke and ya know it
pos,Pos,furkan russell westbrook korkmaz
pos,Pos,i really hate how much i m starting to like grayson allen man do i like that haircut
pos,Pos,korkie borchek was unhinged and awful
pos,Pos,that was the first time i heard grayson allen speak
pos,Pos,chuck is right should be equal punishment
pos,Pos,finally a win
pos,Pos,i like how this thread is the complete opposite from yesterday mfs were mad as hell for some reason but in this one everyone seems calm
neg,Pos,well that was a game of basketball
pos,Pos,so impressive how the bucks were able to win this game despite being down so so many players they somehow overcame this sixers juggernaut
pos,Pos,we can say the bucks barely beat the depleted sixers all we want but when they needed to close they honestly flipped the switch close game that did not feel too close
pos,Pos,someone needs to show reggie miller that nick nurse video regarding drummond
pos,Pos,despite the entire team having covid injuries a b2b against a team with fresh legs and an absolute refusal to call a fucking offensive foul we stayed in this proud of these young dudes
pos,Pos,giannis is by far the premiere foul baiter in the league now run into defender fall over look at ref fta run for an alley oop jump into someone scream fta wonder why no one cares he s exploiting the refs like this smh
pos,Pos,hate to say it but the sixers put up a hell of fight and show against the reigning champs and all without their superstar player ben
pos,Pos,grayson allen is looking like a perfect fit for the bucks once everyone is back milwaukee is gonna be scary
pos,Pos,congrats to the defending champs for beating the 7 sixers by 9 points
pos,Pos,never have i thought that grayson allen would help a wisconsin basketball team dude just flat out shoots so well
neg,Pos,very entertaining game maybe the bucks woke up a little bit can t wait till all teams are healthy and we get some fantastic gameplay
pos,Pos,what happened with that technical that got called and then not enforced they stopped the play but didn t make a call did a fan say something that they thought a sixers player coach did what happened here i just want to know
pos,Pos,as a bucks fan i honestly almost missed embiid s antics tonight didn t feel like a true bucks sixers game like the past couple of years something was definitely missing that was it
pos,Pos,healthy 76ers are the best team in league right now not the warriors
pos,Pos,giannis could sleep walk to 30 15 3
pos,Pos,refs awful again i don t know how giannis gets away with so much lmao gg bucks dudes see y all when we re healthy
pos,Pos,for fuck sake stop shooting kork what an absolute black hole on offense tonight and he just kept on shooting
pos,Pos,smoking on that sixers pack
pos,Pos,great effort by our team to beat the ec leaders without 3 of our starters
pos,Pos,i love you u graysonjallen
neg,Neg,tech take back game
neg,Neg,korkmaz woke up feeling dangerous today
pos,Neg,ted cruz owns the sixers
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i love how sixers fans play the victims all the time like we didnt miss 3 starters anyway we need to fix our offense and get giannis some rest
pos,Pos,how do you rescind a technical foul
pos,Pos,it s come to a point where i just watch games on mute between our new female announcer and the brain dead morons nationally it s just unbearable
pos,Pos,it ain t easy being the best team in the nba
pos,Pos,giannis free throw percentage sucking again makes me sad but glad he always sons the sixers last several times he played them lol
pos,Neg,oh yes
pos,Pos,what happened to grayson allen s top lip
pos,Pos,was grayson this good in memphis
pos,Pos,damn who would have thought maxey has more trade value than ben now
neg,Pos,it s a good sign seeing korkmaz trying so many three s even on a bad night 1 12 this nights happen but for sure he ll repeat the good ones i really like this guy
pos,Pos,2 18 shooting good lord
pos,Pos,dang bruh korkmaz just kept shooting that thang
pos,Pos,why do the sixers throw up so many 3 s when they are missing top players is it a matter of hit and hope
pos,Pos,korkmans what u doin
pos,Pos,the bucks were 4 6 i ve not really heard much about them this year it s all lakers are awful i ve heard a little about atlanta and phoenix not looking great but i would have thought the bucks were just up to their usual shenanigans
pos,Pos,so no embiid simmons harris or curry for sixers that s brutal they can t be expected to win at that point
pos,Pos,grayson has been real nice for you guys great pick up
neg,Pos,furkan korkmaz is not a starter my god
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,sixers would be 11 1 right now with any other coach
pos,Neg,bucks cover 7 point spread
pos,Pos,why is giannis shooting 3s for laughs
pos,Pos,good teams win great teams cover
neg,Neg,we re sacrificing the hawks this month for the braves world series title and so the falcons can be at 500
neg,Neg,i m hot for huerter
pos,Neg,when rudy and don are locked in they are a scary duo
pos,Pos,the game went about how i expected it to atlanta being short handed and on short rest would ve had to had young go nuclear to have a chance too bad both times we played atlanta this year they were on the second night of a back to back
pos,Pos,hoping for a nice jazz run of ws now that they got a nice long home stretch after 10 games in a row in different cities
neg,Neg,did not expect hawks to be 4 8 to start i thought they were going to take a step forward after their playoffs run
pos,Pos,that donovan defense in the fourth was sexy holy shit what an improvement from him this season
pos,Pos,absolute worst part of these games besides the fact we can t play defense can t beat teams missing one of their core players mitchell in jazz game 1 ayton for the suns and the klayless warrior have scoreless droughts that continue even after timeouts a useless bench that can t score and plays full 5 mins all bench stretches and clint is a useless sack of shit is that trae has been efficient in these ls which means we are bound to continue this losing streak when he shoots 6 23 against the magic
pos,Pos,hawks 19 50 2fg
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,another game that i don t think we played that poorly we re just in the middle of a brutal schedule and tonight in particular was always gonna be rough on a back to back against a team like utah while missing two starters
pos,Pos,our schedule has been brutal as fuck which is a shame but i m not gonna let that excuse how pathetic this team looks i can only take watching cam throwing the ball at the back board or out of bounds for so long
neg,Pos,why do we have to play a good jazz team twice in 5 games both being in back to backs i don t understand what this scheduling is
pos,Pos,huerter is the best kevin in the league don t me durant stans
pos,Pos,hawks are struggling a lot to start the season what s up with that
pos,Pos,this team looks so lazy and undisciplined accountability is nowhere to be found that s something that isn t going away with an easy schedule
pos,Pos,for everyone coming in here saying what s going on bad locker room is nate actually shit it s capela and it s also that oo is hurt the real issue is that we built our entire structure around having arguably the second best rim protector in the league behind gobert in capela last season and now the dude looks incredibly washed and our defense is leaking transition baskets after every bucket trae has always taken questionable shots on ok efficiency our 3pt shooting has never been consistent and we ve never really had anyone besides trae to drive to the basket the difference was we had a dude who could outrebound anyone and was a viable escape valve for trae on literally every drive and now we don t
pos,Pos,damn atl has had a brutal schedule to start the year
pos,Pos,someone has yet to post that clarkson highlight that was beautiful
pos,Pos,every game you get a shot of pissed off mcmillian with his hands on his hips somewhere between the end of the 3rd quarter and the beginning of the 4th
pos,Pos,the hawks are not looking inspiring this year we rank near the bottom of the league in every statistic that propelled us just a year prior the worst part about all of this is that theres no easy solution and if you were to ask any two hawks fans about it they wouldn t give you the same answer
pos,Pos,the amount of time trae ran around the basket not attempting to shoot over gobert hawks shot 18 35 from 3 for most teams that would keep the game close these guys except trae and capela can t get to the rim
pos,Pos,mustard ketchup
pos,Pos,what s going on with john collins rough game from him
pos,Pos,hawks are off to a not good start
pos,Pos,can someone explain to me why the hawks are so bad this year just too tough of an early schedule
neg,Neg,nice one jazz bros
pos,Pos,huerters team now
neg,Pos,this sub really had the hawks as a top 3 team in the east lmao
pos,Pos,b b b but r nba told me the hawks were contenders because they made the conference finals
pos,Pos,the jazz are lucky cole anthony doesn t play for the hawks
pos,Pos,there s a bunch of teams with whacky records right now i think this may be the closest parity in teams the nba has had in many years
pos,Pos,per jazz post game radio the hawks were the 10th team in nba history to make at least 18 threes and not break 100 points in a game none of those ten teams won their respective games
pos,Pos,rough start to the season braves took all the mojo for this year
neg,Pos,man the hawks getting passed around like a pack of cigarettes
pos,Pos,tbh hawks have had a brutal schedule just look back on it so far i expect them to be close to 500 by the end of the month as it lightens up the fact the jazz are 8 3 with like a 10 pd with their hard schedule tells me they are still the team at the top of the west warriors need to show good stretches when the schedule gets rough
neg,Neg,love to see it
pos,Pos,llanta hawks
pos,Pos,a week ago i was just happy that we finally won a game again and now we just won 5 straight
neg,Pos,hartenstein batum and reggie making a combined 15m lol
pos,Pos,0 2 clippers are built different
pos,Neg,can dame stop playing and rest the dude is clearly injured there was that one play in the fourth quarter where he aggravated something bledsoe had a good game
pos,Pos,great to see paul george coming through against blitz 1 v 8 defense
pos,Neg,best game by bledsoe in a while made some smart passes and looked good running plays with hartenstein also batum was unreal
pos,Pos,nic batum won me two bets he got the clippers the win with his hot shooting yet managed to only record 1 assist
pos,Pos,pg13 gets shat on a lot on this sub but he s a baller
pos,Neg,is there a reason larry nance jr is playing the lowest minutes of his career has he sucked
neg,Neg,ty lue is really the point guard whisperer
pos,Pos,hartenstein
pos,Neg,clippers on the come up from their slow start won t be surprised if gsw clippers and suns all make the top 6 in the west
pos,Pos,batum 6 8 from deep against his former team
pos,Pos,paul george on a mission
neg,Neg,getting to the wcf was the worst thing to happen to portland they ve kept this core together way longer than they should have
pos,Pos,it s insane genuinely think we may be one of the best constructed and deeper teams like as much as bledsoe is frustrating we re never relying on him for too long and we don t ever need to rely on him for making shots
pos,Pos,eg the prophet busting so hard
neg,Neg,when the clippers get the w i get a little chubby dude
pos,Pos,no one is talking about the clippers but if they get kawhi back they can definitely win that ring this year
pos,Pos,mvpg13
pos,Pos,norman powell is insanely underused he should 100 be getting more shots than mccollum
pos,Pos,we might never win a road game ever again
pos,Pos,the blazers entire philosophy as an organization is begging dame to save them even if he s clearly injured and needs to heal up not sure how they think it s sustainable all season and for a deep playoff run if this is an injury he s been dealing with since the olympics dude is clutching at his ribs often
pos,Pos,we still got the blazers number
pos,Pos,seeing dame grimace with pain after the layup with about 3 minutes left in the fourth can only assume that s the same lingering core injury from the olympics fuck
pos,Pos,much needed w and payback win against a full strength blazers 2 1
pos,Neg,fun fact blazers have 5 players that made espn s list of 100 best nba players for 2021 2022 clips have 1
pos,Pos,pg doing a dagger and one on dame must havefelt so good for him it definitely felt good for me i love me some 3atum baby bledsoe improving finally
pos,Pos,pg s midrange game has gotten better so good
pos,Pos,the roster isnt the problem
pos,Pos,it s time dame
pos,Pos,they really added dame in the top 75 instead of pg lmaoooooo
neg,Neg,mvpg with the clutch shot blazers really doubled off batum
pos,Neg,we can t defend the 3p line dame abdominal injury is back in the picture we can t beat teams without their best players we never fullcourt press for some reason unless game is out of hands then we do we re again going to be low in the west this team s ceiling this year is 1st round specially with teams playing better without their best players
neg,Pos,every good loss is frustrating gg
pos,Pos,jusuf nurkic absolutely dominating 26 5 minutes cody zeller playing like hot steaming garbage more than 0 minutes
pos,Pos,paul george damian lillard
neg,Neg,batum 22 points
pos,Pos,man another team that just happened to go cold and collapse against the clippers clutch time lineup whatever could the reason be certainly nothing to do with the clippers
pos,Pos,mvpg
pos,Pos,we still own blazers dame
pos,Neg,i don t get what portland is doing to dame like if you re not gonna try and put a star next to him then just trade him for the sake of both parties like why keep him if you re not trying to maximize what you can get out of him
pos,Pos,ben simmons is still on the table for cj 3 pick swaps and 3 first round picks
neg,Neg,the blazers are just
pos,Pos,still early but i did not expect the clips to be better than the blazers this season
pos,Pos,cj lillard to simmons confirmed
pos,Pos,clippers run la
neg,Neg,it was a big improvement for the blazers they lost by 30 two weeks ago and only lost by 8 today at the same venue against the same team
pos,Pos,so close dame increases his 3pt percentage on the season to 25 5 still another 0 1 behind russ while the blazers go back to a game below the lakers
pos,Pos,hey blazers fan was dame injured today or no
pos,Pos,the blazers have a lot of guard talent but their bigs are not impactful enough
neg,Neg,this is the first post game thread i ve seen with no awards
neg,Pos,something is up with lillard he looks like he hurt himself in the fourth there but he has been off for a while dude should rest if he is injured he doesn t seem right lately even against the lakers he wasn t playing his usual killer self
pos,Neg,happy to see hartenstein get some solid minutes i remember when he used to come out for garbage minutes in houston
pos,Pos,lol we are shit
pos,Pos,the goat hartenstein with a mvp type performance
pos,Pos,grizzlies win at lac looking better by the day
neg,Pos,watching norm miss free throws and roco miss another layup dunk in the 4th is agonizing dame is the only closer on the team
pos,Pos,i think i saw donald sterlings corpse sitting on the visitor s baseline fuck that guy
pos,Pos,paul george and dame should put aside their differences and team up
pos,Pos,bledsoe ass you hate to see it
pos,Pos,oshley might be gone and the team might get blown up if they continue to he bad concerning times for the blazers fans
neg,Neg,i have blazers over and clippers under fuck this
pos,Neg,this one of them ones when you didnt deserve it but steal it and run home
pos,Neg,time to tell my parents i m a trezbian
pos,Pos,spence and ja jersey swap at the end of the game
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,10 10 would ve lost that game under scott brooks
neg,Neg,the wizards are in the east right now totally didn t see that one coming lol
pos,Neg,the wizards have held opponents to under 100 points in 3 straight games huge turn around from almost dead last in defense last year
neg,Neg,wizards bed time
pos,Pos,enjoy the bed wiz fans good game
neg,Neg,i had three separate panic attacks during this game 11 10 gg cavs holy fuck game for the ages ninja edit evan mobley is already giving me fits this guy s gonna be special
neg,Pos,
pos,Neg,we re going to learn a lot about this team s future with darius garland running the offense full time and okoro as a 2 we really need lauri and love back with sexton gone even if this backcourt balls i still see us matching any offer on sexton since we ll want a pure bucket on the team
pos,Pos,we have a good basketball team and i dont know how to act
pos,Pos,kuzma really came in clutch at the end
neg,Pos,holy shit kuzma does sound like derek jeter
neg,Neg,this this is the nba i fell in love with as a child
pos,Pos,holy shit i never done a 180 on hating a player like kuz and trez beal was cold as ice this game but he was a good decoy the last minute cavs offense was good never seen them move the ball like that
neg,Pos,well for a team so tall we fucking sucked at rebounding way too many offensive boards given up also shooting a 3 when you only need 2 will always make me cringe this one hurt
pos,Pos,we fuckin so hard the wizards bed springs are broken
neg,Neg,the lone first place team ladies and gentleman
pos,Neg,i m bummed
pos,Pos,we demand to be taken seriously
pos,Pos,zaaaaaaarrrrrddddssss
pos,Neg,karl kuzma may be my father
pos,Pos,kispert i swear to god kyle kuzma
pos,Pos,they really turned westbrook into 3 solid players lmaoooo god damn what a trade cavs wizards always fun btw gg
neg,Pos,kuzmania
pos,Pos,kuz was so clutch at the end i know beal was unclutch again with his shots in the 4th but props to him for finding kuz
neg,Pos,kuzma clutched out
pos,Pos,in doubt
pos,Pos,thank you lebron for wanting russell over buddy after fucking the wizards over for so many years i m glad you gave us this in exchange oh btw the bed is open for any and everyone to join us we fuckin
neg,Neg,everybody get in here the east runs through the wizards
pos,Pos,whew lads
pos,Pos,first seed baby
pos,Pos,both these teams are really fun to watch great game
pos,Pos,was this the ecf preview
neg,Pos,wizards run the east
pos,Pos,kuzma is already a wizards legend
pos,Neg,another game won because of our defense its amazing that late in the game i actually have confidence we ll get stops and how about beal instead of forcing a bad shot drives absorbs the entire defense and makes the pass to kuz for the game winner guy is finally playing winning basketball instead of just iso ing for 30 ppg while we lose by double digits wuj for coach of the year the turnaround has been tremendous but harrell and kuzma have been awesome as well
neg,Neg,holy shit the wizards are for real
pos,Pos,this is the best wizards team since their 2016 17 team
pos,Neg,i never thought i d see a first place wizards team
pos,Pos,i feel gross but happy about that win
pos,Pos,the east runs through checks notes washington
pos,Neg,i know we re only 11 games in for most teams but the only times the wizards have started 8 3 or better are 68 69 8 3 finished 57 25 74 75 9 2 finished 60 22 14 15 8 3 finished 46 36 this year 8 3
pos,Pos,kuzma woke up dangerous tonight also great our division is heating up
pos,Pos,i haven t watched a lot of wizards basketball does someone have a take on deni has he shown signs or would you consider him on the road to being a bust
pos,Pos,my boy kuzma is balling
pos,Pos,kuz control
pos,Pos,the wiz are a genuinely weird team and i m here for it
pos,Neg,fuck
pos,Pos,is it normal for mobley to check in with just two minutes left in the game
pos,Pos,get the clean sheets ready
pos,Pos,love seeing my boy kuz prove himself
pos,Pos,don t look now but the wiz are the current seed in the east
pos,Pos,wait the wizards are actually good what
pos,Pos,mobley is gonna be a problem for the league for years dudes so lanky and smooth with it we honestly shouldn t have won this game but this team under wuj is so much more better coached then we have been in the last 5 6 years we are also so deep that even when brad or spence have shitty games a guy like harrell kuz or neto can pop off to keep us in it
pos,Pos,really nice ecf preview wizards can have this game we ll take the ecf in 6 gg
neg,Neg,almost our entire starting five played like complete ass for the majority of the game and we still found a way to get the dub
pos,Pos,hard loss this one cavs let it slip just like the raptors against us offensively we needed more harrell was the best player on the court today
pos,Pos,uhhh 94 is greater than 97 so did the cavs actually win
pos,Pos,hope to see more of this match up fun game
pos,Pos,well that ending made me upset
pos,Pos,kuuuuuuuuzma
pos,Pos,thank uou lakers
pos,Pos,as a louisville fan i m here for the trez 24 11 3 on 8 of 12 shooting
neg,Pos,when they had a retry at that 07 second final three i started having 2017 lebron james cavs wizards sweating flashbacks
pos,Pos,i m surprised by both of their records
pos,Pos,that was an intentional foul but gg wiz anyway
pos,Pos,cavs played about as well as they could with all the injuries it s gonna be rough offensively with sexton out markannen better come back soon
pos,Pos,snatching defeat from the jaws of victory thanks jb shithead
neg,Pos,first time mobley made a defensive mistake should have just given up the 2 also refs deciding not acknowledge the intentional foul on beal cool
pos,Pos,just had to get rid of westbrick
pos,Pos,can t handle ricky man how do you miss both free throws then leave kuzma wide open not to mention he literally misses 1 open lay up per game his entire career its ridiculous i have watched him play on the cavs wolves suns and jazz and he misses one open layup per game like clockwork
pos,Neg,man that was dope
neg,Neg,fun chess match between two of the best young coaches in the league
pos,Pos,we have slightly used trey burke if you want to make po push cavs just give us your late 2nd
pos,Pos,i m sorry but what the fuck is kuzma being this good a fluke
pos,Pos,shouldn t kispert have just run the clock out instead of making that layup with 0 7 seconds left i can t decide if that was a smart or stupid play
pos,Pos,barnes and mobley trading great games like pokemon cards bro this roty race is wild
pos,Pos,and that relatively unwise play by kispert at the end where he should have just held the ball ended up covering the spread are the wiz finally gonna win 50 games
pos,Pos,fun game my 1st game back since covid and the crowd got into it sucks it didn t go our way but the cavs still almost stole it no sexton is going to be a huge loss for us
pos,Pos,fresh sheets on the wizards bed baybeeeeee
neg,Neg,i don t see much mention of this in the thread but isaac okoro is an absolute menace on defense gave brad fits all night long obviously mobley is a special player but the cavs defense really impressed me tonight especially okoro gg cavs
pos,Pos,kuzma brickbrook straight up
pos,Pos,kd decided he didn t want to miss today
neg,Neg,sure 11 12 from the field is impressive but not as impressive as deandre bembry statpadding masterclass where he got 4 offensive rebounds on a single possession in garbage time truly drummondesque edit it was day ron sharpe
pos,Pos,i don t care how many games i ve watched him play having kd on your team looks like cheating this man is unreal
pos,Pos,i miss the old harden the 50 10 10 harden
pos,Pos,kd going for that 5th scoring title
pos,Pos,damn guess the magic aren t winning it all this year
pos,Pos,so we learnt that kd scores practice layups 15 ft from the basket harden can pass and score well and lamarcus is having that second peak apparently
pos,Pos,bro harden doesn t even have to score anymore he just chills and playmakes while kd drops 30 on 15 shots every night and they still don t have kyrie
neg,Neg,cam thomas first nba bucket anyway another hyper efficient 30 points from kd 11 12 from the filed lmaoo
pos,Pos,this is a very lackluster title considering the score lol
pos,Pos,durantula
neg,Neg,the only thing that can guard kd is his own handle i swear he has more tov than missed fgs in tons of games lol
neg,Neg,kevin wayne durant is the best player on the planet
neg,Neg,kd scored 30 33 possible points if he made every shot
pos,Neg,cam thomas scored
neg,Neg,kevin durant is just too good right now and old harden is back
pos,Pos,true this did happen harden was controlling everything when he was in the game definitely looking better
pos,Pos,at least franz was stealing that shit like candy from a baby
pos,Pos,fatboy slim duo showed up today slim reaper doing slim reaper s thing i m literally convinced that not playing 18 monts of organized basketball was good for kd ooh and lamarcusmidrange don t seem he want to cool off patty mills with the 2cnd highest of the team on a cold shooting night millsap with the 3rd one that team is fun harden is finding his groove and he s adjusting his game with the new rules s o to jevon carter too
pos,Pos,i never understood why kd wanted to leave okc especially since it was so close to beating the warriors this year i finally understand and i have more respect for kd for even making it to the conference finals with westbrick
pos,Pos,kd is on a whole another level now best player in the league and the next 5 spots are empty
neg,Pos,kd is good at basketball
pos,Pos,it s nice to be really confident knowing you re probably going to win i don t think i ever felt this even during the kidd era
neg,Neg,every night i pray to kevin durant
neg,Neg,i just realized both wagner brothers are on the same team thought dude was on washington
neg,Neg,kevin durant missed 1 shot just to remind us he s mortal
neg,Neg,hows my guy suggs
neg,Neg,didn t see the game just wanted to state for the record that griffin s statline looks really weird going 0 5 with all 5 attempts being from 3 while playing c
pos,Pos,kevinnn durannttt
pos,Neg,defenses are really just a formality for kd huh
pos,Pos,79 78 107 88 points allowed since the team dinner not meeting the defensive potential this roster showed is coming up big time
pos,Pos,chris boucher has massively regressed into barely a nba player
neg,Pos,timelord with the game high 20
pos,Pos,timelord was everything tonight always seems to be in the right place
pos,Pos,our point differential s back in the black baby by the skin of our teeth richardson s strip at the end saved it
neg,Neg,since a raptors fan made a post saying the raptors are 5 0 after benching dragic the raptors have gone 0 3
pos,Pos,barnes is one of those players that just has a knack for being in the right spot at the right time
pos,Pos,don t let tatum s boxscore fool you he shot terribly however he was crashing the defensive boards hard he was always passing the ball and finding the open man as well as limited iso while playing solid defense granted this was moreso true for the first half 3rd quarter he was alright and 4th quarter was kindly ugly for him but i think he got lazy because we were up by 14 overall pretty solid game for him where he doesn t have to shoot well to contribute to a team win
neg,Pos,nick nurse goes through the five stages of grief when a foul call doesn t go the raptor s way
pos,Pos,tatum a true kobe fan honoring him with the 8 24
neg,Neg,birch is insanely valuable to this team send precious to the g league
neg,Pos,marcus not so smart with a great game today
pos,Pos,as a raps fan scottie barnes was the only thing keeping me from scratching my eyes out
neg,Pos,oh shit we played today
pos,Pos,anyone else feel like tatum was seeing the floor better tonight with passing lanes and showed some real emotion like when smart got hit on a fast break his shooting was off but this 100 made it seems like he is back celtics defense is also legit this season
pos,Pos,jeez finally
pos,Pos,sad
neg,Neg,i love when time lord decides to attack the glass like tonight i get that with his injury history rob is trying to be more careful so he s not going after rebounds like this every game but when he does it s super fun to watch
pos,Pos,everytime i say it i get downvoted but we need a proper centre and shooting having 20 players that are 6 8 and like being in the paint is cool but we get destroyed when a team has a good shooting night and or they have a big we don t have an answer for
neg,Neg,lmao you lost to the celtics
pos,Pos,siakam is not a bad player but the raptors play better without him
neg,Neg,is it just me or does it look like precious doesn t care when he plays
neg,Pos,if you don t like it you do that love raptors basketball baby
pos,Pos,east just straight cannibalizing each other at this point
pos,Pos,man i love timelord a lineup of smart brown tatum williams plus a guy who could actually playmake for us would be a championship contender
pos,Pos,do you think precious is selfish cuz he had like 5 other siblings he had to share with
pos,Pos,fred dont read twitter tonight
pos,Pos,i never want to see precious play again
pos,Pos,remember when people thought pascal siakam was good like really good remember when people voted him for mvp that was hilarious
pos,Pos,raps need to get rid of siakam
pos,Pos,dennis has proven to be an excellent signing
pos,Pos,tatum has been terrible so far this season it s concerning at this point
pos,Pos,nice d boston i hate watching tatum play though jaylen come back pls
pos,Pos,how am i supposed to say cade s a bust when he has games like this smh
pos,Pos,jerami grant
pos,Pos,get out tanked nerds
pos,Pos,another game ultimately lost by free throws the fact that there is apparently teams worse than us at free throw shooting at least i think there is is depressing to think about
pos,Pos,i m 100 certain christian wood is point shaving
pos,Pos,jerami kevin durant grant is my hero
pos,Pos,absolute trash performance from this team it would be a miracle to get 10 wins the offense is so hard to watch and this team can t hit fts either love both cade and green
pos,Pos,thank you detroit pistons for being us one game closer to chet holmgren gg
neg,Neg,season starts now 74 8 here we come
pos,Pos,im sorry but that was some brutal reffing job
pos,Pos,it s one game i love cade and i like jalen one game don t mean shit if jalen dogged cade most of this sub would be calling cade a bust both are clearly going to be good just enjoy it happy cade is shaking off the rust in his 5th game of his career with no training camp and no pre season people calling him a bust should get banned for a week the espn hot takes in here are cringe worthy
pos,Pos,u cadecummingham thoughts
pos,Neg,i just love how in control cade is i also hate how out of control we get when cory joseph comes in and i really think he s quicker or at least more agile than people think he s getting more and more separation for himself
pos,Pos,i m just here to comment cause there s not always a pistons post game thread on r nba so idk fuck the officials that s my most dominant emotion after this game
pos,Pos,cade just keeps improving good game by him and jerami
pos,Pos,cade s floor seems to be a solid guy on a good team looking forward to seeing him grow and get better
pos,Pos,jalen green has the raw athleticism and aggressive mindset to become a star cade cunningham has the sound fundamentals workmanlike approach to his game and is constantly wanting to take coaching to become an all around star it s going to be fun to watch both of their respective developments
pos,Pos,i m not asking for us to be a playoff team or anything we re still way too young and inexperienced but worst team in the nba back 2 back seasons are you fucking kidding me trade house for a used condom fire silas and trade gordon to a real team
pos,Pos,idk if silas is the worst coach in the league or the greatest tank commander of all time
pos,Pos,did green score after the tech
pos,Pos,almost a manufactured nailbiter by the officials
pos,Pos,jalen green has 23 points through 3 quarters on 8 16 shooting rest of the rockets ight better not pass to him
pos,Pos,all for banchero
pos,Pos,tank mode full steam ahead there really isn t a single thing this team does well they might just set the all time record for losses
pos,Pos,great game from both rookies tonight
pos,Neg,good game from cade looks like he s getting more comfortable out there
neg,Neg,ggs pistons both our young guys showed up would ve loved the w but can t win em all well to be precise we can win exactly _one_ i guess
pos,Pos,well well well those anthony bennett comparisons sure lasted long now did they
pos,Pos,hahahaha yes fuck r nba
pos,Pos,solid game from cade
pos,Pos,saddiq with the game high 14
pos,Pos,always nice to get a win at home
pos,Pos,jerami grant is a good basketball player
pos,Pos,kevin porter jr just consistently makes losing plays dude makes nick young look like a winner
pos,Pos,that was painful cade definitely outplayed green
neg,Neg,not trying to sound bitter but we won despite the worst one sided reffing i ve seen in a while
pos,Pos,i thought for sure the rockets would take this those last three possessions when they were down 2 3 made absolutely no sense is this loss on silas it s not like age is an excuse here both teams are young and this game felt like it should have ended with a buzzer beater instead of the low percentage shots from the rockets near the end
pos,Pos,cade finally had an efficient game after shooting 0 14 from three in his first two games he s coming in hot
pos,Pos,tank rolls on bad basketball o for paolo still very much alive
pos,Pos,oh no jalen kept mean mugging us guess we ll have to cry into our win about not having him
pos,Pos,green scores points cade leads teams that s why he was number one pick
pos,Pos,refs were garbage lots of trash calls gg rockets bros
neg,Neg,if the rockets knew how to hit a free throw this would have been an easy win which is a wild sentence to type considering the 2015 2019 rockets were essentially automatic from the line
pos,Pos,killian hayes you can t have a pg playing that many minutes that does those 4 3 4 ass numbers consistently
pos,Pos,pistons won the battle game but lost the war tank
neg,Neg,grant is too good for the pistons
pos,Neg,we gave up 16 offensive boards
neg,Pos,the amount of pull up 3s
pos,Pos,this was such an ugly game but we got a needed w
pos,Pos,we definitely would have won if we could hit three throws rebound play defense not turn the ball over have a point guard not settle for long contested twos or play rotations that don t score for five minutes at a time
pos,Pos,watching kpj at point guard is gonna give me an aneurysm before the season ends
pos,Pos,cade with the good game love to see it
pos,Pos,green porter jr are definitely the wario waluigi to cunningham hayes mario luigi
pos,Pos,great matchup between green and cunningham mano y mano
pos,Pos,green is athletic energic oozes big dick but he still too dumb careless shoot selection he goes to the rim forgetting nba players can block him cade is way more shy than green dont try to takeover but its cleary how much smart on the court he is than green that clutch 2 was beautiful when grant starts choking cade took the ball and helped pistons to win two awesomes prospects both franchises should be happy
neg,Neg,kpj can be good but holy shit what a braindead he to the ball just as much i drink water
pos,Pos,it s always fun watching raw young talent going at it
pos,Pos,an unstoppable force meets an immovable object
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,can t tell if a win is a loss or loss is a win between both of these teams
pos,Pos,these records tho
neg,Pos,pistons could really have used garza this game with all the foul trouble the pistons had at center
pos,Neg,imagine if the rockets and pistons somehow both fall out of the top 3 picks for the draft
pos,Neg,i would be blown away if the rockets win 10 games this year
pos,Neg,in europe a game like this would be important for the relegation battle
pos,Pos,yay we won the tank off
pos,Pos,anyone who didn t watch will look at the stationery and think they had similar games jalen green was giving cade the blues for most of the game silas has to do a better job those guys were playing keep away from the hottest hand in green kpj stunk the joint i love cade but he needs to attack the rim more often is woods allergic to post ups
pos,Neg,kilian hayes is a certified bust why tf is cade not at pg
pos,Pos,the people in this reddit must all be children because the base their entire opinion off seeing someone play once also jeremi grant had 5 points in 40 min last game
neg,Neg,is it me or this year teams that are trash are really trash pistons rockets and okc are among the worst teams in the history of the league until the bobcats that won 8 games at least
pos,Pos,are pat connaughton and grayson allen the goat backcourt duo
pos,Neg,knicks defend a 3 pointer challenge impossible not clickbait
pos,Neg,nice to see thibs rocking with the bench when they got it going
pos,Pos,wait it s all planet pat always has been
pos,Neg,also this game shows why the wall doesn t work anymore sure giannis will end up with fewer points but our wings will end up with wide open 3s all day
pos,Pos,planet pat and grayson allen carrying the lads
pos,Pos,is pat connaughton the best basketball player ever
pos,Pos,pat connaughton is the best player in the nba
pos,Pos,i really think curry could break the three point record against the knicks at this rate
neg,Neg,knicks gotta get better defending behind the arc there s always someone turning into steph at msg
pos,Pos,tell your gms the secret is athletic white shooting guards
pos,Pos,the white boys turned into charmander in the fourth
pos,Pos,the amount of emotions i felt during this game lol
pos,Pos,allen and pat being this good seems unfair especially when khris and brook come back
neg,Neg,giannis needs to win dpoy
pos,Neg,no pat slander tonight bucks should always be thankful we ve got this guy for 3 16
neg,Pos,wall defense against giannis great wall defense against the bucks terrible pnr with giannis kick out extra pass wide open 3 from the corner from our best shooters x 30
pos,Pos,damn we won with giannis being our 5th highest scorer
neg,Neg,drose is terrifying gg knicks bros
pos,Pos,i guess this is the difference between a squad led by an nba mvp and one that s not really tired of the bench having to pick up after the starters toppin is looking great at least
pos,Pos,i thought d rose was washed
pos,Pos,giannis as always elite defensively such a great player and the bucks such a great offense
neg,Pos,bobby was flat out dominant in the first quarter we are so lucky as a franchise
pos,Pos,derrick rose is legitimately a phenomenal player still and the best player on the knicks imo his plus minus is insane this year when he s in he facilitates makes good decisions plays great defense and shoots absolute lights out these days randle s game is kinda shitty to watch when he s leading as opposed to drose running plays he just backs down a player into a contested turnaround fadeaway brick with 10 seconds left on the shot clock and he s shooting under 35 on those yet takes at least 6 per game lol
pos,Pos,taj gibson is a big physical man and that s all i gotta say about that
neg,Pos,knicks made a great comeback but the bucks were just hitting everything
neg,Neg,damn bucks were just raining 3s
neg,Pos,can we not shid and fard our pants when we have a double digit lead
pos,Pos,i like that thibs let the bench win or lose that game
pos,Pos,pat connaughton
neg,Pos,pat and grayson allen the new splash bros you heard it here first
pos,Neg,damn that home crowd had more energy than some bucks playoffs games and fiserv isn t a quiet stadium by any means msg is no joke
neg,Neg,thought it was a blowout by third got close but the barrage of threes by bucks
pos,Pos,time for thibs to make some adjustments at the 1 and 2 because kemba and fournier are giving us absolutely nothing rn not saying they need to be on the bench but definitely would like to see the grimes and mcbride get some type of playing time randle isos aren t hitting like last year just swing the ball for a better shot dude kills any momentum on the offensive side with these dumb long range 2s not checking but i feel like d rose has to be among the league leaders in this year the way he has been running the bench for us has been such a joy and a big positive for us this season offensive rebounds are killing us this year and i feel like that s something that needs to be emphasized after tonight can t count how many times i seen the bucks get a good look at a 3 after missing a shot or two
neg,Neg,haha never in doubt fuck sakes that knicks bench
pos,Pos,i know it s cool to shit on our defense right now but we re also comically unlucky at this point i mean seriously to have another team hit seven straight 3 pointers against you to end the game is ridiculous that doesn t even happen in a video game
pos,Pos,removed
pos,Pos,this game was fun as shit knicks with the comeback and momentum at the start of the 4th glad the bucks weathered that storm then pat and grayson closed it out
pos,Pos,behold we got the new splash bros pat grayson
neg,Pos,you ve binged your last bong
pos,Pos,grayson clutch allen
pos,Neg,the bench stepped up when the starters didn t crummy birthday present for my pop s birthday knicks f u conoughton
neg,Neg,pat connaughton the knicks franchise
pos,Pos,that was so close to being a repeat of the last game in milwaukee bucks look like they have a comfortable lead 20 points but the knicks dig deep and have this ridiculous surge in the third quarter milwaukee had to break out the aimbot to wrestle it back
neg,Pos,kemba and evan get out that s it just get out i said you were both mistakes from the beginning and i will stand by it until you prove otherwise and we all know you won t
pos,Pos,hope knick fans are enjoying the kemba walker experience
neg,Pos,that overturned foul block call was total horse shit and i willl stand by that but damn our 3pt defense sucks this year and our starting lineup we have a good team here just need to figure some shit out
pos,Neg,bing bong mf
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,thibs went all out trying to get the ball out of giannis hands good job thibs
neg,Pos,knicks fans really thought kemba and fournier would put the team at the top of the east lolol
pos,Pos,knicks fans really salty for losing a regular season game lol i guess it makes sense given their lack of post season success in the past decade
pos,Pos,knicks finally learning how to shoot lights out but losing all perimeter defense also giannis totally fouled obi with his right arm glad the refs sucked all the momentum out of the game though that s fun
pos,Pos,that overturn was such a momentum killer it was the wrong call too but whatever
pos,Pos,removed
pos,Pos,interesting for the knicks to leave their bench in for like 20mins straight they ran out of gas guess it s thibs though
pos,Pos,we have to be be the absolute worst team in the league at defending the three its actually pathetic most frustrating thing is if one of our starters plays average above average this at least goes to ot 2 and the game is ours
neg,Neg,i m absolutely sick of our 3pt defense nothing has changed
neg,Neg,damn 50 on 52 3s our perimeter defense sucks
neg,Pos,knicks bench seem to actually run an offense and play defense while the starters take turns driving and playing hero ball except rj i m not mad at his playstyle at all not sure why thibs hasn t corrected this but it was obvious in this game that the knicks starting five need to start whipping some passes around to find open shots
pos,Pos,knicks doing poorly to defend the perimeter and the white boys made them pay holy shit pat
pos,Pos,nice of the slower teams in the east to start waking up now and putting pressure on the east again bucks nets and celtics all coming for that top 6 spot
pos,Pos,can t believe we almost came back in this one guys like burks and quickly can hopefully build off this as they ve had slow starts to the season so far we didn t deserve to win this game but i still think that overturned foul was kinda bs i don t see how taking out his left arm before even touching the ball isn t a foul but it is what it is the time it took to review it completely crushed the momentum as well but again we were lucky to even be in that position at that point in the game so can t be too upset
neg,Neg,alex caruso is a godsend him and lonzo are fucking unbelievable on defense and create so much easy offense
neg,Neg,man chicago is fuckin good they move well off ball create turnovers and there s enough good shooting to compensate for one or two guys being cold for a stretch if lavine doesn t get you then derozan will and if derozan doesn t get you then lonzo will and if lonzo doesn t get you then vuc will and after all that there s still caruso i m starting to wonder if we are going to make the playoffs based solely on the fact that like half our schedule is new orleans san antonio and houston
pos,Pos,i love this little bald alien we seem to have acquired
neg,Neg,you just lost to
pos,Pos,alex caruso the glue factory for dallas
neg,Neg,lakers fans must be sick watching bulls games or wizards games or lakers games
pos,Pos,bulls are hard to beat when lonzo ball turns into klay thompson caruso has a shot at an all defensive team too
neg,Neg,zach got angry this game
pos,Pos,zach really lead both teams in scoring while only being 7th in fga in this game that s insane to me
pos,Pos,the crime wave in chicago is getting worst a 40 years old bald accountant just robbed some tourists from texas
pos,Pos,lonzo is officially an elite 3 and d guy now
pos,Neg,5 guys with atleast 15 pts tonight chi slamma jamma baby love this fucking squad can t wait for this west coast road trip
neg,Pos,it s about that time
neg,Pos,great game by the bulls they re fun to watch luka went heroball there towards the end not so fun to watch seemed like he was actively avoiding feeding kp
neg,Neg,thank you la for not being willing to pay caruso zach getting that supermax next off season no sweat
pos,Pos,just got out of a thai prison is alex caruso the best player of all time
pos,Pos,bulls are the most exciting team in the nba bulls warriors finals i m here for it
pos,Pos,motherfucker stop fuckin playin em like that them bulls savages out there if i catch another motherfucker talking sweet about the bulls i m fucking beatin they ass i m not fucking playin no more
pos,Pos,alex caruso
neg,Neg,ak you beautiful human you building this squad
pos,Neg,yo that caruso steal lonzo bullet pass and lavine fast break 360 was so sick all that talk about them having no defense seems very much overblown and they still have derozan and vucevic lol
neg,Neg,i love basketball
pos,Pos,caruso with 6 steals and is 3 this is why i hate when someone uses to judge a player
pos,Pos,what the hell ac we supposed to suck on defense cmon
neg,Neg,lonzo stephen curry ball
pos,Neg,caruso with six steals
pos,Pos,i hope chicago goes all the way and demar wins fmvp
neg,Neg,its so nice to love watching the bulls again this team is so fun in so many ways and the one thing most saw as a problem their defense is so fun to watch all great pieces added working together there s constant movement ball handling 3 level scoring and attacking defenders
pos,Pos,chicago is a very fun team to watch they played well i love him but luka was incredibly frustrating tonight considering kp and thj played well enough to give us a chance he ll be fine but it s maddening to watch right now
neg,Neg,bruh kp has a good game and we proceed to just ice him out wtf
pos,Pos,caruso was fucking amazing tonight like he has been all season i knew it was the right move when we got him
pos,Pos,6 steals in 22 minutes is silly
pos,Pos,here s your dallas mavs post game summary now in our 6th season 6 did the mavs win too many big runs given up to overcome luka with a near triple double tonight finishing with 20 8 10 to go with 4 steals albeit on rough shooting kp had his best game of the season this far with a nice 22 12 on good shooting timmy played well tonight too with 21 3 2 with 5 3 s dwight with a solid 12 4 2 blocks bench analysis brunson burner was pretty much the bulk of our bench production with 12 4 7 tonight overall not as rough a loss as the past 3 losses before tonight were with tonight not being a blowout we lost to a good team that played really well especially from a 3pt shooting perspective we re playing the spurs next yet again this friday for the 3rd time in not even a month
pos,Pos,y all know what time it is john hollinger come get your slander dumb bitch
pos,Pos,mavs will be the litmus test of the west if you can beat them youre a potential playoff team if you cant youre prob a lotto team also luka was ass today mavs aint winning shit if hes not playing well
pos,Neg,ac for mvp
pos,Neg,vuc had to play good in front of his fellow euros
pos,Pos,luka pass to porzingis pls
pos,Pos,alex deballzać is the goat
pos,Pos,bulls played great tonight lonzo and caruso both stepped up when derozen was struggling it s amazing having two elite defenders in lonzo and caruso
pos,Pos,nicaruso debalzac with another beautiful game
pos,Pos,seeing the usually calm lavine show some fire after that late dunk was awesome love to see the emotion this year i hope we can keep doing enough to find wins during this tough stretch of schedule
pos,Pos,maybe lonzo really is steph curry with a 30 inch vertical
pos,Pos,vuc was playing like himself lonzo was shooting lights out zach scored 23 points off 12 shots caruso was immense alize was back in the rotation and had some good minutes on porzingis javonte still doesn t look out of place as a 6ft4 pf ayo still looking solid what a good collective win bring on the west coast trip
pos,Pos,man this bulls team has me very excited oof
pos,Pos,i m biased here but if the bulls hand the warriors their second l of the season on friday then we can agree they are contenders right
pos,Pos,after so many years of garpax the bulks are finally legit
pos,Pos,i can smell the championship
pos,Neg,deballdzach for the win
pos,Pos,friday is gonna be so fun
pos,Pos,we re the best bulls team to ever walk the earth terms and conditions may apply
pos,Pos,what i ve learned so far this year is that if teams want an easy win let luka spam the pick and roll and send three his way dare our role players to beat you bc they have shot horrendously to start the season and until they start hitting shots respectfully luka is gonna continue to struggle on the brightside kp has looked good to start the year defense is there and his shot has been nice in the games he s played
pos,Pos,luka got the caruso clamps tonight
pos,Neg,i hate this team
pos,Pos,porziņģis was incredible tonight 22 12 on 9 16 shooting luka drug us down tonight
pos,Pos,happy for bulls fans y all have legit roster these days
neg,Neg,these game featured players mav fans thought weren t good enough for this storied franchise lonzo vooch derozan it was just something wrong with the fit age or play
pos,Pos,luka s cheeks be clapping up and down the court after gaining that weight
pos,Pos,man look at caruso so inspirational
pos,Neg,well well well bulls fancy seeing you up here seriously who would have thought the bulls and wiz would be tied for seed right now lol
pos,Pos,lonzo could not miss a 3 in the first half caruso can pick my pocket any time
pos,Pos,ugggghhhhh we still haven t beaten a good team yet luka was awful but at least kp looked good
pos,Pos,so are the bulls like actually good i ve been thinking well at least i got to watch the mj years for a long long time now lol
pos,Pos,caru
pos,Pos,was at the game and caruso is my favorite player what a show
pos,Pos,i really like this chicago team this year how far do you guys think they can go
pos,Neg,this bulls team is really fun to watch
pos,Pos,the bulls are fucking real this season
neg,Neg,west coast let s go
pos,Pos,caruso with 6 fucking steals my god this bulls team is legit greatest off season moves in getting derozan lonzo and caruso
neg,Neg,finally an 18 10 game from vuc
pos,Pos,luka has been horrible this year lol
neg,Neg,alex deballzać is the goat
pos,Pos,anyone ever noticed how the vocalist for the band middleman that appeared on 2k11 looks like alex caruso
neg,Neg,3rd quarter bulls are the new 4th quarter bulls
pos,Pos,yeaahh boooiiiiii
pos,Neg,i love alex caruso
neg,Pos,the bulls are so fun to watch
pos,Pos,deballzach
pos,Pos,love this bulls team this season let s hope the team is healthy come playoffs time because i m sure this bulls team will be competitive against every contender team in the east
pos,Pos,not going to lie this bulls team has got me hard
neg,Pos,bulls fans how you feel about javonte starting should that be caruso instead
neg,Neg,luka said its easier to score in the nba ans the league took that personally
pos,Pos,bulls are my side team now
neg,Pos,the bulls have weapons to throw at teams and that could take teams off guard very easily this is probably the first time in demar s career in a long time wherein he can struggle and still win convincingly
neg,Pos,the bulls are back baby
pos,Pos,so garpax was an actual problem seeing how quickly bulls became so good
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,dallas is just a mess luka is frustrated and he should be they didn t trade kp away like they should ve done and they didn t get any help for luka really he is going to ask for a trade if they don t get their shit together soon also the refs are targeting him by not going him free throws when they should i know some of them are right because he still tries to get them himself but come on when is the nba going to call out their refs because of their bad job
pos,Pos,zachshowdeballs
pos,Pos,ayo will be really fun in a few months when he learns to vary his speed
pos,Pos,my boy ac with 6 steals getting 20 mins play tine wtf
pos,Pos,mavs legitimately looked worse at some points this game with luka like the time he came in slowed down momentum and immediately turned it over twice obviously better with him but rough game outside the box score
pos,Pos,i can t believe legm has deprived us of the bald mamba had he been a client of klutch we would have still had him on the team
pos,Pos,i m so happy for lavine
pos,Pos,nice win for a potential 6 seed
neg,Neg,is patrick williams out for the seaosn
pos,Pos,we winning it all so many dunks
neg,Neg,i fucking love this team
pos,Pos,why are we getting so many random pictures in each post
pos,Pos,people in this comment section still be sleeping on the bulls
pos,Pos,i won t ever forget the bulls fans who argued that caruso was overpaid just a meme and that our front office was crazy for giving him that contract same goes for lonzo and the worst free agent signing this offseason demar derozan
pos,Pos,lonzo ball 7 for 10 from 3 point range
pos,Pos,luca looking a bit bulky
pos,Neg,this chicago team is looking like the real deal on both sides of the court i honestly saw them as a 500 team before the season incredible
pos,Pos,i want ac to start
neg,Pos,curry with a 40 inch vert
pos,Pos,pro gamer tip if you let kelly oubre put 40 on your head you are going to lose
neg,Neg,holy shit we won a road game
neg,Pos,hop on reddit see the post game thread scroll down kelly mf oubre drops 37 off the bench wat
pos,Pos,the next step for bane is to learn how to be useful when his shot isn t falling because jfc he was only a grizzly because he wore their jersey today also the bench outside of brooks was laughable kelly oubre literally dad dicked our entire bench and it might have been a literal crime if dillon brooks didn t give us 20 also also pls send help can t score against zone defense
pos,Pos,yowza
neg,Pos,bonk
pos,Pos,you hornets get yourselves an actual center and you got yourself a stew
pos,Pos,well it took the grizzlies shooting 18 from 3 on good looks and oubre scoring 37 off the bench but we finally won a damn game the starting lineup is becoming a huge problem how is plumlee still a thing so hopefully we shift the rotations after this long roadtrip good on borrego for playing mcdaniels again he and cody are so needed to carry our sorry defense
pos,Pos,delete this game film so nobody else realizes we are shit against zone defense
pos,Pos,how do you do
pos,Neg,kelly revived us single handedly from the worst 3rd quarter i ve seen in a while also i really like the grizzlies court i wish we played there more than once a year
neg,Neg,hornets adjusted well to our bench and that was the huge difference maker tonight played zone when we had no shooters out also helped bane was cold and oubre had the game of his life tonight also jenkins rotations were awful tonight if something does not work why let it play out for nearly half a quarter sigh oh well at least brooks and jjj looked good tonight ja too as usual we just gotta rinse this loss off and prepare for suns and pels
pos,Pos,oubre to hornets seems to have been great for both teams
pos,Pos,got ko d by k fucking o
neg,Pos,we looked really really good tonight the passing was crazy good you really love to see it after a long and disappointing road trip
pos,Neg,happy for tsunami papi to perform like this on the bench especially the 3 point shooting get your bag
pos,Pos,i have in my fantasy adams ja hayward bumlee and goat oubre jr im so fucking happy
pos,Pos,hornets fans why isn t bouknight getting any pt
pos,Pos,why did the grizzlies continue to foul when down 8 with 10 seconds to go and almost take gordon s leg out shitty play imo
pos,Pos,i love t unami papi and glad he had an awesome game hope he keeps this up
pos,Neg,oubre was who he thinks he is tonight
pos,Pos,oubre is better than steph
neg,Pos,east west
neg,Neg,oubre gone off but hayward got to shoot 11 ft what the heck was he driving all game
neg,Neg,who is this nickeil alexander walker and what did he do with the other nickeil alexander walker
pos,Pos,muscala 17 in 13 minutes hot damn
neg,Pos,i m just waiting for giddey s td
neg,Pos,nola about to fuck around and beat the bobcats worst win
pos,Pos,if poku made that open layup in first half giddey would ve finished with rebounds assists double double lmao
pos,Pos,okc is now where they were last year at the all star break hovering around 400 with the 11th seed in the west
neg,Pos,on pace for 1 81 let s go pels number 1
pos,Neg,how low for paolo
pos,Pos,dort
pos,Pos,the tank is officially canceled we going for 3rd seed
neg,Neg,embarrassment to the league
pos,Pos,scott foster saying oh shit on live tv really summed up this game
pos,Neg,damn we really cant lose
pos,Pos,lol linemakers really put the pelicans at 4 easy money
neg,Neg,okc just need a better pf and c and they ll be good for the future
neg,Neg,pelicans season already over what the hell
pos,Pos,okc fans watching their team dribble it out up 28 in game 4 of the finals after sweeping brooklyn this wasn t part of the plan
pos,Pos,that game was ugly
pos,Neg,3 w s in a row we re better than this guys
pos,Neg,the national media jinx has gone to far quick someone say we are a spooky team so we can go on a sick 20 game losing streak
pos,Pos,play like a marmoset for chet
pos,Neg,dort
pos,Pos,i like this team
pos,Pos,tank machine broke have a good day
pos,Pos,the pelicans suck
pos,Pos,sga is going to have a foot injury again if okc wins too many games again
pos,Pos,i understand with zion and bi back that moves things around but the pelicans have to have the worst bench in the league kira has been such a disappointment this year he is just not putting it together trey hasn t replicated his pre season form but he s a rookie so nbd hayes looked great at the end of last season this year he has been sporadically spastic would like to see him take a 3 per game and make more of an impact on the defensive end sato should get zero minutes seriously naji looked like a josh hart replacement last year this year he has looked like a g leaguer at least herb brings the energy and discipline
pos,Pos,lottery you re talking about the lottery i just wanna lose a game mark daigneault s presser
neg,Pos,the giddey triple double is so close
pos,Pos,damn poku can t even get going against the pelicans
neg,Neg,okc fans we want chet okc players we have a chet at home
pos,Pos,if we don t choke against the clippers this team is 500 although i guess i can t really claim that after the utter collapse by the lakers twice
pos,Pos,past 3 lotto picks played a combined 20 minutes tonight traded last years picks for jv graham like they had any chance of competing just awful
neg,Neg,we re closer to the play in than we are to paolo and i have mixed emotions about the entire situation
pos,Pos,i thought okc was tanking
neg,Neg,all of a sudden all these thunder and clippers picks are not lookin good smh
neg,Neg,okc lineup was a barkley s dozen wow
pos,Neg,another w thunder fans i will not financially recover from this
neg,Neg,as a canadian and fan of the raptors seeing jonas nickeil dort and shai play well is just the best feeling
pos,Pos,shoutout nickeil alexander walker 22 5 1 1 1 in just the 4th what a man
neg,Neg,lmao you lost to the thunder please stop doing that
pos,Pos,there s a chance the pelicans get banchero and have zion bi banchero josh hart my goodness
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,i hate it here
pos,Pos,nola s season is over even before zion has played a game gotta feel bad
neg,Neg,time to enter full tank mode and not play zion for this season
neg,Pos,losing against the pelicans is harder than winning against them
pos,Neg,lebron really gave david griffin a career lmao
pos,Neg,meanwhile i have to watch ja drop 30 on a nightly basis on good efficiency we should have picked morant
pos,Neg,we should be focusing on how just how bad certain teams are year after year timberwolves pelicans knicks rockets it s just bad to tank in broad daylight and i m certain the players aren t even having fun
pos,Pos,presty about to fire the coach not cause he s doing a bad job but just to fuck w chemistry
pos,Pos,the pelicans need to fold it up
pos,Pos,pelicans looking like the may flirt with destiny this year fuck around and usurp the charlotte bobcats for worst season in nba history
pos,Neg,this is not a shot at new orleans in anyways but what they hell is the point to the pelicans franchise they have no desire to win and exist for the sake of existing the nba is getting so big with its tv deals that teams like the pelicans can make large amounts of money while having a roster of fringe players and an empty arena and their owner seems more than okay with that the desire to field a competitive team is just not there for some owners and with their base revenue not even being tied to attendance anymore they really don t need to
neg,Neg,1 11 like i know injury is the reason but that s insane
pos,Pos,what would a backcourt of these cousins look like
neg,Neg,ain t no way zion is coming back to this shit
pos,Pos,the long heated and controversial debate on who the better coach is may have been settled tonight
neg,Neg,we did it we beat a west team
pos,Neg,spurs have a positive point differential even though they have a losing record probably a better team than they look like on paper
pos,Pos,damn the spurs collectively decided to just not defend fox for some reason but now we know as long as our opponent shoots like dog shot from 3 and we shoot above 50 we have a chance
pos,Pos,also oh lord it seems you ve lost to the san antonio spurs
pos,Pos,same trash team same trash franchise what 70 more games of this garbage before we get to that sweet sweet early spring exit to our season for the 16th year in a row the ineptitude of this professional sports franchise is absolutely mind boggling and a hearty fuck you vlade for that marvin bagley pick we picked some dude whose only accolade is to be able to double jump once before getting injured and who has the balls to refuse to enter the game when we were desperate and needed a warm body out there unretire 21 from the rafters because this dude set this franchise back literal years and we get to watch it all unfold night in and night out best part of all this bullshit kings are in the top 5 most expensive tickets to go to a game by some accounts we are the 2nd most expensive it has been 15 years since we played a game that mattered gtfo with that shit
neg,Neg,dejonte has taken that leap that i swearing he would in years past
pos,Pos,how does eubanks have 13 ft also nice seeing fox having a great game
pos,Pos,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray
neg,Neg,lol the kings really tank for almost a decade just to lose to a bunch of 29th picks
neg,Neg,22 more
pos,Pos,can we fire luke walton yet you can t use the financial excuse to keep him around anymore
pos,Pos,if thad keeps playing like this we might get a decent return for him at the trade deadline also devin vassell is the fucking truth
neg,Pos,as bad as the start of the season has been spurs are tenth in the league in point differential 2 1
neg,Pos,thad young is pretty good
neg,Pos,bagley dnp
pos,Pos,not good game for harrison barnes mvp campaign sad
pos,Pos,fox played his best game and the rest of the team plays like shit go figure 0 5 with mark jones where the fuck are all the espn games
neg,Neg,monte please deliver us a new coach
neg,Neg,uh oh you friccin moron you just got eubanged tag your friends to totally eubang them
pos,Neg,i m ready for another miracle tankathon run for a top 4 pick
pos,Pos,poor bagley didnt even get garbage time minutes
neg,Pos,yeah what s your point man
neg,Pos,because walton
pos,Neg,5 7 is still too good a record to call them the kangz yet
pos,Pos,ready to get rocked by the thunder on friday
pos,Pos,how does barnes only have 8 fga
neg,Neg,well i find that title unnecessary
pos,Pos,what was up with richaun holmes he didn t get to play a lot of minutes haven t seen the game but was just wondering
pos,Pos,i know everyone is gonna praise barton as we should but holy shit what a game by zeke his defense was super good was rebounding super well and those two 3s were super important hope to see him more instead of jamychal big win
pos,Pos,jok why don t you play like this when i m in ffs
pos,Pos,thrill nnaji with a good game too career high 19 i d rather have him in the rotation than one of the greens
neg,Pos,scheduled w what was jokic statline
pos,Pos,markief morris just gave jokic a free night of rest haha
pos,Pos,the thrilllllllllllllllllllllllllll
neg,Neg,shoutout to the person who called barton going off in the suspension thread
pos,Pos,pacers cannot win a close game to save their life
pos,Pos,barton putting up 30 on 11 19 and 6 9 from 3 is great to see when we re missing so many players way to step the fuck up thrill
neg,Pos,
neg,Neg,b baller bucket getter o only bench scoring option free zeke to starters n nice young man e easy bucket getter s singer rapper too
pos,Pos,is jokic holding the nuggets back
pos,Pos,this game goes up there in the nuggets pantheon of wins with games like the seven and game 6 vs utah
pos,Pos,brb give me a minute to delete all the barton slander i commented last season
neg,Pos,i would say i m surprised but i m absolutely not
pos,Pos,nuggets adapt so well with whoever they have to work with each player ready to step up and adjust the plan to allow the team to flourish really impressive
pos,Pos,thanks markeef for boosting the confidence of the nuggets bench
pos,Pos,lets go zeke big game young fella
pos,Pos,this is will bartons team
pos,Neg,our defense is legit
pos,Neg,pacers down bad
pos,Pos,a surprise to be sure but a welcome one proud of our guys tonight
pos,Pos,munder and hiremalone
pos,Pos,if you told me my favourite game of the season so far would be without jokic mpj murray i wouldn t have believed you
neg,Pos,the pacers are tj mcconnell s team
neg,Pos,didnt even cost his team an l
neg,Pos,bones is going to be so good
pos,Neg,will barton s nuggets
pos,Pos,the willy b for buckets barton game shoutout the young guys too great game
pos,Pos,bones and zeke the next great pg pf duo
pos,Pos,the healthy will barton redemption tour is so fucking gratifying god his haters were irrational toxic obnoxious dults and now they are silent
pos,Pos,will barton hype fest lets go boys
pos,Pos,the death of will barton has been greatly exaggerated
neg,Pos,it was a bones day
pos,Pos,i don t mean to be rude but how do you lose against this team
pos,Neg,michael malone is a underrated coach and top ten one in fact
pos,Pos,pacers wtf
pos,Pos,sometimes you win sometimes you get steph curry d will barton d apparently
pos,Pos,wow we are bad bad
neg,Neg,barton no doubt the second best player for the nuggets this season pretty big lead over morris offense and ag defense who are a distant 3rd
pos,Pos,a team won without all their star players that should be an impossible feat
pos,Pos,shoutout to that redditor who knew bol will not play
pos,Pos,give barton mpj s contract
pos,Pos,i hope turner wins dpoy one year that guy always makes me wanna throw up
pos,Neg,
neg,Neg,why we don t play brissett more i will never know
pos,Neg,honestly i d rather the pacers just start throwing games away at halftime so i don t have to watch the full game to get my heart broken
pos,Neg,great game by the nuggs but just embarrassing for the pacers atrocious performance from the wings
neg,Neg,the shot to tie was close tho
pos,Pos,we suck
neg,Neg,carlisle a bald fraud
neg,Pos,what is going on with these challenges absolutely robbery
pos,Pos,pros dame is heating up cons just about everything else
pos,Pos,it s not every day when frank the tank decides to incinerate your entire team
pos,Pos,even though we lost i m glad someone like lillard could step up when anfernee goes cold
pos,Pos,undefeated since this post
neg,Neg,footprint frank should have been in the nba 75
neg,Neg,nurkic going to have nightmares about mikail bridges tonight
neg,Pos,frank
pos,Pos,this sub loves piling on the lakers but why is no one talking about the defending western conference champion suns being 1 3 i didn t realize until now that the suns are currently 1 3 why is no one talking about this they lost to a mediocre kings team a couple days ago and nearly lost by 30 pts to the trailblazers with a struggling damian lillard and from what i know they re just about fully healthy for anyone actively watching the suns this season what s the main reason for the early season struggles you would think they d have a bunch of momentum to start the season after their amazing finals run
pos,Pos,kaminsky is my lord and savior praise him go forth and shun the nonbelievers
pos,Pos,where were you when r nba realized that frank was no longer a meme and actually a contributing piece to a contender aside from the 3rd quarter this was a fun game to watch and i love that it started at 9 and not 10 for me so i could enjoy all of it without worrying about going to bed after midnight all in all great game gg portland
pos,Pos,immediately after the game according to staffers jody allen marched into the coaches locker room and unloaded berating head coach chauncey billups and his assistants demanding answers as to why they didn t make any adjustments to stop the lithe crafty suns center veteran assistant scott brooks who did not respond to a request for comment spoke up saying the short handed trailblazers had made several in game adjustments fronting kaminsky doubling him on the catch explaining other basketball minutiae scott starts throwing all the s at him and the guy has no idea what any of that means said one former coach details that others in the room confirmed allen livid marched toward the door and screamed no adjustments on his way out
pos,Pos,how do you not put frank the tank in the title
pos,Neg,this blazers team seems to hit a dead end this season
pos,Pos,the goat debate is over frank kaminsky over jordan and lebron any day
pos,Neg,good lord francis
pos,Pos,close up the mvp race
neg,Pos,frank the mf tank
neg,Pos,kings should have held onto this guy
neg,Neg,put frank in the all star game you cowards
pos,Pos,honestly franks always had skill he s just not that athletic and tentative he just seems more confident right now
neg,Neg,not having a good time rn
neg,Neg,frank the tank
neg,Neg,fucking pussies better be fucking scared of fucking frank kamisnky iii fuck
pos,Pos,you just lost to frank kaminsky
pos,Pos,dame can easily ask for a trade to philly but nooo smh he s passing up the opportunity to play alongside georges niang
neg,Neg,ummmm neil it s the roster you put together jeez it s f ing obvious by now
pos,Pos,ayton in shambles and quite frankly he should be worried about starting
pos,Pos,frank is a serviceable and sometimes good nba player and i will not hear arguments otherwise
pos,Pos,thank frank
neg,Pos,running from the grind time
neg,Pos,reports say that the suns phone keeps ringing for inquiries about frank kaminsky
pos,Pos,i need to know what atlanta thought about edwards trying to push for 50 with the game out of reach
pos,Neg,the warriors really need to come up with some adam sandler the waterboy style strategy to convince wiggins that he has a reason to get revenge against every team lmao also probably the worst refereed game this season jesus christ the refs were so inconsistent
pos,Pos,wiggins cashed in one of his three monster games for this season
pos,Neg,it s been a while
neg,Neg,anthony edwards was just unstoppable
pos,Pos,winners warriors second place timberwolves last place everyone who had to watch that fucking ref performance it was like the way you could tell whether someone got fouled was by the whistle if the whistle blew that play was clean as fuck
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,kat will likely see kevon looney in his nightmares from now on
pos,Neg,wwwwlwwwwwwarriors
neg,Pos,kat 17 12 in 38 minutes looney 11 17 in 29 minutes bruh
neg,Neg,ant damn near willed the wolves to a win today herculean performance by him wiggins had the goat tier revenge game man had a personal vendetta against kat today warriors really gritted this one out after losing dray great showing of mental toughness and fortitude dlo needs to come off the bench not consistent enough on offense traffic cone on defense warriors hunted his ass all game for free buckets twolves desperate needs wings who can shoot team would be a lot scarier if they had any wing depth twolves passing is godawful so many telegraphed passes for to s need to seriously work on cleaning that up otherwise itll be hard to get wins edit oh and the refs were fucking garbage hope that crew never works together again
pos,Pos,not kevin looney out rebounding kat dude held it down
pos,Pos,new plan let ant be our westbrook for the rest of the season
neg,Pos,losing fuckin sucks especially when andrew is going off like that feels super bad man i think it s so bad for ant to be losing so many games and getting used to losing like this same thing happened to wigs and kat they re just used to losing winning is a habit and so is losing we have a losing culture and honestly idk what changes that
neg,Neg,wiggins fucking hates the timberwolves
neg,Neg,i want klay to come back healthy so bad and the warriors to just resume destroying the league imagine if they beat the nets in the finals
neg,Neg,getting the same vibes when the 2016 warriors were 15 0 and they were saying they haven t played anyone
pos,Pos,if andrew wiggins has mamba mentality he would be the undisputed goat and there s no exceptions about that
pos,Pos,wiggins woke up and chose violence
neg,Pos,minnesota fans tryna figure out where this wiggins was lol also wiggins vs edwards was a good little past vs present showdown poor kitty kat though lmao
neg,Pos,
pos,Pos,ant that is all
pos,Neg,ant cannot win those kats
pos,Pos,this game should have been over at half but ant just did not let it go and wow where the fuck has this wiggins been the whole time at this point warriors have had 6 blowout wins in 6 games but are still being written off because they haven t played a real team yet
pos,Pos,looney with the 12 orb 5 drb game lmao
pos,Pos,that game legit felt like 5 games lol so eventful
pos,Neg,i hate when fans complain about the refs but man they were on another level of terrible
pos,Pos,only the twolves could get 48 points out of a second year player and still lose by 15 looked it up just for fun teams are 48 13 since 2020 when a player scores at least 48 points
pos,Neg,mad props to loon pretty much outplayed kat all night
neg,Pos,disrespectful wiggins is a top 10 player in the league
pos,Neg,wolves need to build around edwards watched a few minnesota games this season and kat is just so unimpressive awful defense moves around like a sloth and hides on the 3 point line on offense
pos,Pos,edwards is a stud wolves don t fuck it up
neg,Pos,anthony despite the loss edwards
pos,Pos,kevin looney was amazing on kat tonight
pos,Pos,anthony edwards wants to be steph so bad but he s only capable of 7 threes and 48 points instead of 9 and 50 s
pos,Pos,ant vs wiggins just like we all expected
pos,Pos,kat looked like dogshit
pos,Pos,ant was playing like giannis at the end that explosiveness is insane
pos,Pos,w for wiggins w for warriors
pos,Pos,74 8 here they come
pos,Pos,gsw 2022 champs because they are just that good
pos,Pos,big ups to anthony edwards no quit in him i think its safe to say he s put to rest all the pre draft concerns about his motor and passion for the game
pos,Pos,2021 22 warriors officially on pace to win more games than the 2015 16 warriors
pos,Pos,gotta love andre with the 0pts team high
pos,Pos,look at that box score ant is actually unstoppable need more from kat or he s done here trains gone words out whatever ant is here
pos,Pos,wojnarowski at one point in a scrimmage sources said wiggins turned to gm scott layden and screamed you bleeping need me you can t win without me wiggins left teammates and coaches largely speechless he dominated the game in every way andrew s back
neg,Neg,alternative title the golden state wiggins 10 1 defeat the minnesota timberwolves 3 7 123 110 sorry steph but this mapple jordan team now
neg,Pos,i call this one winning a trade
neg,Pos,wiggins is so good for us man i will never under appreciate what he provides for us on a side note anthony edwards is fucking elite jesus
neg,Neg,the great performances by a lot of players this game shouldn t be overshadowed by the most atrocious attempt at a ref job i ve ever seen i don t give a fuck if it s considered punching down it was incredibly satisfying to watch the warriors beat the brakes off this team in spite of so many disgusting calls
neg,Neg,looney decided to show kat who s the best center from the 2015 draft today
pos,Pos,i m so tired
neg,Neg,i feel bad for ant
neg,Pos,all warriors have to do trade wiggins to every single team in the nba and immediately trade for him back he ll be the next wilt
pos,Neg,really bad officiating smh
pos,Neg,i think the wolves are closer to being good than the conventional wisdom seems to suggest i don t know what the missing piece is but it feels like they should be better than they are
neg,Neg,ant let down by his teammates again kat looks lethargic and dlo is a mess this year
pos,Pos,so are we ready to stop acting like kat is the savior that the wolves have been holding back or not yet
pos,Pos,looney outplayed kat is embarrassing
pos,Neg,someone get anthony edwards some help
neg,Neg,warriors were in the same situation until their new owner bought the team and started making mass changes same thing will have to happen to the wolves
pos,Pos,kevon looney had 12 offensive rebounds wtf
pos,Pos,welp we learned one thing tonight this is ants team also sir wiggins nice revenge game
pos,Pos,wiggins activated that 5g this game
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,lets fucking goooooooo
neg,Neg,kat too busy fucking j woods to care
pos,Pos,steph missed 2 free throws dubs still win bench pulling their weight
pos,Pos,wiggins is a baaaaaaaaad man
pos,Pos,looney kat
pos,Pos,i know we give old man looney a hard time but shoutout to him tonight man dude won a matchup against an all star
neg,Neg,kat looks like he just doesn t give a fuck absolutely no hustle
pos,Pos,i am so fucking excited for the bulls game hope draymond is ok to play
pos,Pos,the one game kat should ve dominated and he came up short damn
neg,Pos,75 win pace baby
pos,Pos,due to my fantasy interests i ve been watching the twolves a lot this year and man kat just needs a change of scenery idk what it is but he just doesn t look like he wants to be there his body language has been really bad when he doesn t get the ball even if he gets shoved off the block and out of good position he still rolls his eyes and shakes his head like his teammates are to blame i m not a psychologist but clearly there s something deeper than just i m playing on a bad team the problem for him would be that there is no trade package out there that would be worth it to get him to a new situation
pos,Pos,how you let a man posterize you not once but twice in the same game
pos,Neg,still blows my mind we got wiggins and a 1st for d lo
pos,Pos,i would trade d lo for nature valley bar crumbs
pos,Pos,wiggins ant efficiency
pos,Pos,we need a kat shrine outside of chase center wiggins might fuck around and average 30
neg,Neg,wiggins was going at kat s head lmao
pos,Pos,free edwards
pos,Pos,feels like kat works so hard to not work so hard
neg,Neg,wiggins and looney abusing kat all game
pos,Pos,dubs without dray managed to beat the wolves and the refs
pos,Pos,two way wiggs he had to go off it s the twolves
neg,Pos,jesus looney with 12 offensive boards
pos,Pos,damn dlo simply smiling in his own turnovers wtf no killer instincts whatsoever along with kat who was domesticated by wiggins and looney
pos,Neg,12 offensive rebound for looney damn
neg,Neg,ant with 48 sheesh
pos,Pos,this twolves team is real their record belies their quality edwards kat dlo they really gotta a squad
pos,Pos,why does wiggins hate kat
pos,Pos,wiggins just put all his energy into this game but can we talk about the number one pick tho he puts that much into a performance and they still lose by 13 wtf kat doing man
pos,Pos,wigs sat down before the game and watched 35 sigma male grindset videos
pos,Pos,day wiggins that other side man we stay winning
pos,Pos,man kat is awful and i don t see a realistic way for minny to trade him no team that wants to contend wants a center that is soft and absolute cheeks on d maybe they can deal him to a tanking team that just wants butts in seats edwards looks special already and it would be a shame to waste some good ant years with a wasteman like that as a star
neg,Neg,wiggins woke up today and chose violence
neg,Neg,what a duel of wiggins vs passionate wiggins
pos,Pos,wiggins just decided he d dunk on kat whenever he wanted today i guess
pos,Pos,okay minnesota you guys need to get your act together and start winning some games to make the playoffs warriors want wiggins to face you guys in the first round
pos,Pos,the minnesota timberwolves are bad
neg,Pos,peace out goodbye
pos,Pos,wiggins did dastardly things tonight
pos,Pos,heeheeheeeheeeee
pos,Neg,the spookiest version of wiggins
neg,Pos,wiggins decided today is a good day for revenge
pos,Pos,i really want to like kat but
pos,Pos,edwards is just a different athlete
pos,Pos,entertaining game from both teams worst officiating i ve seen in a while
pos,Pos,2014 pick vs 2020 pick
pos,Pos,kat is basically an ig influencer now
neg,Neg,kat wasn t kidding when he said the timberwolves losing streak was going to snowball into a massive number a week or so ago
pos,Pos,holy fuck ant is something else everybody knew the moment draymond got hurt that he ll keep scoring and the only thing the warriors could do is to force him a turnover ant commits a turnover late in the 4th and wiggins ate up
pos,Neg,the warriors are in pace to go 74 8
neg,Neg,third quarter wolves are inevitable
neg,Pos,so gsw is back that s great
pos,Pos,40 fts for the warriors holy hell
pos,Pos,first game i ve seen this season where ant consistently drove to the rim
pos,Pos,wow
pos,Pos,73 9 incoming
pos,Pos,that s our fourth straight double digit win it s a good year klay and wiseman not even back yet
pos,Neg,good game for wings drafted by minnesota not a good game for bigs drafted by minnesota shout out looney for locking up kat
pos,Pos,dlo s contract is fucking atrocious
pos,Neg,standouts wiggins and looney we all saw wiggins massacre kat several times that game and looney did his best to trouble kat as well as grab 17 rebounds 17 payton had a great second quarter we had a great second quarter in general third quarter was a bit ugly even before we lost draymond it just made it worse porter had some nice offensive rebounds really allowed us to make up for our shitty shooting night steph has a quiet 25 which is what makes him steph andre was andre with some great steals poole needs to be more consistent the refs were terrible but i think we ended up shooting a lot more free throws than the wolves honestly the wolves should be scarier d lo kat and ant are great three point shooters beverly is an absolute pest on defense but i guess after that their roster looks a little thin got a little nervous when the lead went down to 4 but porter kept us alive with his offensive rebounds and wiggins extended the lead i knew it would be that kind of night for wiggins when he scored the first seven points in a row the man was on a mission i only wish he was that aggressive every night
neg,Pos,and i took that personally wiggins probably
pos,Pos,wiggins legit has me thinking maybe joe rogan has a point
neg,Pos,wiggins woke up and chose violence against kat lmfao
pos,Pos,this kind of shit is going to make kat leave getting postered twice by his former teammate and objectively worse player who gets to be on a 10 1 team if we don t make noise very soon kat is going to leave for a winning team and i m going to be happy for him when he does
neg,Neg,kat for simmons straight up who says no
neg,Pos,incredible game by ant unbelievable game by wiggins
neg,Pos,melo has an off night and the lakers win melo got a squad now
pos,Pos,me when i saw adebayo do that putback dunk oh me realizing it was actually p j tucker oooohhh
pos,Pos,lakers can t do anything the easy way
pos,Pos,best free throw defense in the league
pos,Pos,thought we were going to get whoooped so i ll take this w
pos,Pos,heat killer monk
neg,Pos,phenomenal game lakers won exactly how they needed to with bron out shoot insanely good from 3 and have a bench star emerge monk was that guy tonight i loved seeing the bam v ad battle even if i m sad we blew a relatively sizable late 4th q lead hopefully our next matchup both jimmy bron can go at it
pos,Pos,great with morris coming back miami is gonna be mad at us next match up really intense game tho unfortunately they re coming for us next
pos,Pos,i m just here for bron s dear leader fit wtf was that lmao
pos,Pos,man can we get a fucking blowout or something lmao
pos,Pos,we cannot play a normal game that was fun though
pos,Pos,malik monk was an insane pick up for the lakers
neg,Pos,both teams competing for who could throw the game away more lmao
pos,Pos,russ outplaying lowry is poetic lol
pos,Pos,bestbrook in the building
pos,Pos,westbrook is a roller coaster of a player to watch
neg,Pos,frustrated at the choke job but on the other end that ending was hilarious so oh well gg lakers let s never talk about this again yeah
pos,Pos,lakers choked but heat choked harder
pos,Pos,fun game
pos,Neg,those 3 missed freethrows by the heat and this game still went down to the last possesion gg heat bros
pos,Pos,robinson really turned into bertans hate to see it
pos,Pos,it s crazy that their record is 7 5 seeing the posts on this site you d think this was their first win of the year
pos,Pos,sorry op if the lakers lost you d have gotten 10k karma
pos,Pos,russ wasting 24 seconds and bricking a shot is 100 better than ad taking a semi contested midrange j with 16 on the shot clock up 5 the man has no clock awareness he did the same againt the hornets
pos,Neg,what a game both teams were choking that lmao
pos,Pos,monk has been using the calm app
pos,Pos,it wasn t his bestbrook but getting better
neg,Neg,enjoyable game hope everyone had a swell time
pos,Pos,what the fuck did i just watch
neg,Neg,westbrook escapes from awkward speech and nitro another day
neg,Neg,i still fail to understand why westbrook thinks that a pull three is a good shot for him fortunately for them the heat struggled to make threes in regulation robinson and lowry combining for 5 15 and free throws in overtime that being said this game doesn t mean very much to either team with the lakers missing namely lebron and the heat missing butler after the early ankle injury
pos,Neg,nba finals preview lol
pos,Pos,i knew the lakers won because there are no highlights or stats from this game within the top 50 posts on the frontpage
pos,Pos,that wide open three by herro lmao why does this team make everything hard
pos,Neg,russ lowry
neg,Pos,free throw training for the city of miami for the rest of the week
pos,Pos,i m willing to wait till january to see if westbrook is washed he s a notoriously slow starter the last two years and then turns it on
pos,Pos,35 to 16 free throws and i still had miami fans whining about the refs lul
pos,Pos,not that this game has any significant impact or meaning but the lakers playing a lot of close games this early in the season curious to see what this laker team looks like in march and april
pos,Pos,nothing in basketball is better than watching two teams that absolutely don t want to win duke it out unfortunately only one team could lose tonight haha
neg,Pos,and if you don t like that i can t really say i blame you
pos,Pos,goddamn that adebayo travel
pos,Pos,excuse my english where were you when malik monk killed the heat
pos,Pos,laker top performers westbrook ad monk honorable mention bradley ellington shooting in general heat top performers bam herro honorable mention lowry not getting nearly enough attention pj fuckin tucker i have not seen that man move like that in years there were many plays where i thought wait wtf was that tucker
neg,Pos,we might legit only have like 3 losses if we didn t have dumb turn overs and made like 80 of our ft s
neg,Neg,duncan going 1 3 from the ft line has killed me
pos,Pos,i wonder how long before another westbrook bash thread nahh those fuckers are just gonna sit quietly in the corner waiting until the next game
pos,Pos,malik monk gonna get paid next season
neg,Pos,road to champions 77 5
neg,Neg,the lakers were doing everything possible to lose this game and the heat were doing everything possible not to capitalize on those mistakes
pos,Pos,i now genuinely understand the whole lakers tried so hard to give the game away meme goodness gracious that win was a miracle with the way they were playing at the end
neg,Neg,just here for schadenfreude
pos,Pos,i know mf s are gonna do all they can to discount this win for us but idc man i had fun watching it shoutout our players for stepping up this is actually a big win for us
pos,Pos,you mother fuckers better make russ statline its own post like you do when he sucks ass edit thank you
pos,Neg,robinson is actually regressing why did we pay him ffs
neg,Neg,that games was yikes
pos,Pos,ugly but that was fun to watch
neg,Pos,lakers u win heat no u
pos,Pos,this game took years off of my life
neg,Neg,herro carried this squad and duncan shit the bed
pos,Neg,no miami you were suppose to win this one not lose
pos,Neg,intense game but the last lakers play in regular time awful westbrook with a 3 yuck heat s last play in ot was kinda iffy too since herro was shooting cold and they had enough time
pos,Pos,man even russ s good games are semi tarnished by all those needless turnovers
pos,Pos,to be clear we are not a good team somehow we beat miami without lebron though
pos,Pos,we are one of the most entertaining bad teams in awhile
pos,Pos,anyone hating on herro didn t watch the game
neg,Pos,both teams trying to lose at the end lol
pos,Pos,heat refused to win
pos,Pos,were the heat trying to lose in ot that was just abysmal
neg,Neg,miami better play this badly tomorrow too the lakers handed them the game on a silver platter and they fucked it up
pos,Pos,i swear i lose a year of my life every time i watch a lakers game
neg,Pos,this game was like if that 2017 cavs wizards game had the bad ending
pos,Pos,this team buttcheeks but gutsy win against a good team without lebron isn t too bad
pos,Pos,wow this team needs to make free throws in the clutch
pos,Pos,that was one hell of a choke and i m sayin that as a pels fan lol
neg,Neg,so lucky to get away with that win i know we have a lot of people out but so many turnovers boneheaded mistakes and errors bad defense especially right at the end of the game and missed free throws
pos,Pos,this lakers team reminds me of the ravens this season in terms of how close all of their games have been this season
pos,Pos,is it me or does spo s late game plan go like this 1 running game tying or winning plays for ice cold players freezing out the hotter shooters if the plays dont work then 2 run plays for now frozen formerly hot shooters that also dont work 3 4 profit
neg,Pos,the heat looked like us last year cant hit an open shot to save their lives
pos,Neg,malik monk bless us
pos,Pos,this game was something else man fun to watch westbrook needs to just drive at the ends of games instead of settling it makes it alot easier for him and he s way more effective that way regardless he s very entertaining to watch but also infuriating at the same time lol good win
neg,Pos,lowry foul was bullshit but what a terrible great game
pos,Pos,how is duncan shooting better from 3 than westbrook i swear he has missed every shot
neg,Neg,what did we do to you monk every fucking time
neg,Neg,one day anthony davis will realize he can t shoot the 3
pos,Pos,really amazed with the lakers game this time they tried everything to lose this game but the heat just wont take it
pos,Pos,as someone who didn t watch what was dwight doing in his 11 minutes
pos,Pos,all i know is pain
pos,Pos,that free throw defense was cooking down the stretch
neg,Neg,lakers love ot wins
pos,Pos,lebron lol his outfit his coming onto the court gotta love it
pos,Pos,great game the heat ran the elevator play to herro perfectly and he fumbled the ball lol
pos,Pos,ah bestbrook
pos,Pos,lakers actually won for a change
pos,Pos,i love staying up till 1 30 to watch my 5 game parlay get snuffed out in ot of the final leg
pos,Pos,our turnovers were old enough to drink
neg,Pos,free throws we lost because of free throws
pos,Pos,both teams deserve an l lol but tyler herro s so good x4 seriously though this kid just gets tough buckets
pos,Pos,lakers cannot close without lebron
pos,Pos,lebron with the mao tracksuit
pos,Pos,a win without lebron is so huge team is looking so much better every game
pos,Pos,westbrook with these 3 point attempts on game deciding shots might just kill me
pos,Pos,despite our best efforts to lose
neg,Pos,can t wait to see the heat s corridor photo shoot after that one
neg,Neg,why the fuck did we have russ in the backcourt on those last 2 inbounds everyone knows that s the easiest way to get the ball in and russ was literally the last guy we wanted to take the fts
pos,Pos,and somehow the heat still piss me off even when they lose you had one fucking job
neg,Pos,i don t even know what to say anymore thank you refs and malik monk i guess
pos,Pos,worse game of the season
pos,Pos,westbrook gotta stop shooting the last shot still a defensive liability smh
neg,Neg,we re pathetic on our wins too never seen a veteran team this horrible at managing the game down the stretch putrid defense in 3 key possessions westbrooks defense is putrid all game every time they have a chance to put the other team away for good they just do something stupid to help the other team and this doesn t happen like once or twice it happens like 5 times per game not close to championship basketball not even playoffs basketball this is charlotte bobcats levels of basketball maybe even worse than that cause that team lacked talent
pos,Neg,what s the excuse now
neg,Neg,why does malik monk hate miami so much swear he cooks em every time also found lebron dressed like chairman mao to be very distracting
pos,Pos,the lakers could have lowry instead of westbrook
neg,Pos,lebron really channeled his inner mao zedong with his game fit
pos,Neg,this game is what happens when there are zero clutch players on the court
pos,Pos,why is ads so bad every game
pos,Pos,where was the foul when lebron was on the court during play 48 seconds left in ot after duncan s ft
pos,Pos,another 5v8 win
neg,Neg,we may see this matchup in the finals again fun game lakers needed to look better and they did miami showing they had a great foundation in 2020 and lowry puts them over the top
pos,Pos,russell freakin westbrook malik freakin monk best win for the lakers so far both teams played a hell of a game good game miami
pos,Pos,this westbrook roller coaster is scary made two jumpers in a row iso 3 for a clank then turnover at some point haha i really wish he just pass for melo or monk in that last four quarter procession
neg,Pos,if you ever wondered how easily officials can switch a game around these put on a clinic in the last 4 minutes of regulation seemed the point was to make it come down to a last shot situation even with the sudden no calls for travel on bam and then even worse no call on melo with 30s left in ot
neg,Pos,why did jimmy play for only 12min
pos,Pos,monk herro
pos,Pos,westbrook mvp
pos,Pos,heat you donky
pos,Pos,westbrook missed a quadruple double with only 2 tos if he tries at the beginning of the game sky is the limit for him
pos,Neg,luckiest win i ve seen in a while
neg,Pos,monk dominated that scrub herro lol
neg,Pos,bro idc let westbrook play the regular season and limit him to 26 28 min in playoffs he ll block his own teammates to get his triple double
pos,Pos,westbrook with 8 turnovers
pos,Pos,lakers keep winning by sheer luck and in ot a people may say miami is a good team at least but they were without jimmy for 3 4 of the game lakers are a sure disaster this year a team that couldn t guard a parked car
pos,Pos,thank you ref s for fucking us hard this game gotta love that lakers privilege
neg,Neg,downvote me all you want but refs gave this one to lakers
neg,Neg,lmao
neg,Neg,amazing game clusterfuck of an ot besides malik monk
pos,Neg,wtf was that last defensive possession
pos,Neg,hero ball
pos,Neg,there had to be a winner eventually
pos,Neg,that s malik monk s flu game
pos,Pos,neither team deserved the win bruh what was that at the end
pos,Pos,free throws remain not overrated
pos,Pos,despite trying their best to lose lakers managed to win
pos,Pos,how did herro even fumble that pass from lowry
pos,Pos,what a game
pos,Pos,the execution towards the end of this game was terrible for both sides like no one wanted to win missed ft inbounds violations travels bad shots leaving herro wide open
pos,Pos,can t wait fot mason and ireland tomorrow after watching that ending lol
neg,Pos,there goes my herroooo
neg,Pos,monk was cooking
neg,Pos,man malik monk went off
pos,Neg,nice comfortable win
pos,Pos,for real who was throwing harder during that overtime
neg,Neg,fucking 10 37 from 3 i hate it here
pos,Pos,wtf is this game lmaooo
pos,Pos,lowry doesnt have his jumpshot right now
neg,Pos,what s a free throw make
neg,Neg,lakers going galaxy brain by blowing it in regulation and winning in ot i guess
pos,Pos,missed fts blame the wilson ball
neg,Neg,malik lou williams monk
neg,Pos,free throws fucking free throws y all lakers haven t been good at fts for like a decade it feels like
neg,Pos,what a game
pos,Pos,no lebron no problem
pos,Pos,malik monk single handily won the lakers this after giving away their lead in the third huge shots to keep them in it lakers playing sloppy though adebayo and herro are such great young players for the heat fun game to watch
neg,Pos,idk guys i think malik monk is more valuable than alex caruso
pos,Pos,someone needs to ask doc rivers whether tyrese maxey is a championship level point guard
pos,Pos,maxey is fuckin incredible
pos,Pos,raptors with 100 ft percentage is pretty nice to see
pos,Pos,chris boucher heard every single one of us talking shit
neg,Neg,announcement freddy has big balls
pos,Pos,they say basketball is a game of runs but that was ridiculous felt like the whole second half was the raps going on a 10 0 run then the sixers going on a 10 0 run then the raps then the sixers then the raps
neg,Neg,goddamn the end of that game was stressful
pos,Neg,fred vanvleet ain t no spot up shooter
pos,Pos,lowry s mom was there by herself rocking a raptors hoodie and mask what a fuckin legend legit heartwarming i love how well the sixers are playing without simmons especially with a young pg going hammmmmmm they don t need you ben get comfortable
pos,Pos,man if only we had a real big
neg,Pos,i always knew my guy anunoby would be special how he s grown
pos,Pos,much better game from boucher especially in the second half he s been playing like we know he can following up on plays crashing boards defensive rotations gritty stuff also there have been some calling into question his chemistry with scottie we can clear any doubts with one occasion where chris hypes up scottie and one where scottie hypes up chris y all been kinda hard on him he s still figuring it out after coming back from an mcl in an otherwise relatively major injury free career minus oregon which is surprising since he is pretty much four sticks and duct duck tape
neg,Pos,gg sixers also your broadcast team is delightful shout out to kate scott acknowledging remembrance day in canada
pos,Pos,gg raps well coached team to fight that hard on a road b2b scottie barnes is the real deal
pos,Pos,convinced that maxey s floater is unblockable
neg,Neg,107 100 raptors with 3 41 remaining then 107 109 76ers with 1 32 remaining 76ers had a 9 0 run going on and the raps finished the game on a 6 0 run
pos,Pos,we are not allowed to have a stress free game this season at this rate i m gonna need to replenish my liquor supply to manage the stress
neg,Neg,inhales
pos,Pos,fuck i wanted maxey big time when the kyle lowry rumors were swirling last deadline but the dude is showing why philly wasn t gonna let that shit fly dude is a baller
pos,Pos,scottie saw the rookie ladder said naw
pos,Pos,freddy lugging his massive nuts down the floor
neg,Pos,first time seeing scottie barnes play hell of a baller
pos,Neg,that drummond block called as a foul and eventual loss of possession after a successful challenge was complete bs for philly i ll take it though but man i would hate if that was my team probably the main reason the raps closed out
pos,Pos,maxey is a god
neg,Neg,can we get a gif of the fvv celly
pos,Pos,it should be illegal to be as deep as the sixers are they re missing like half the damn team and almost beat us lol good win tho also maxey simmons idc
pos,Pos,maxey is fantastic who needs ben simmons when you ve got a young stud like that he s going to be fun to keep an eye on
pos,Pos,lol just trade simmons for some decent 3 d guys and you re all set maxey is miles ahead of that fucking lazy bum
pos,Pos,now haters might say that philly were missing 2 of their better players or 3 technically who knows what s going on with that but what they don t know is that raptors were missing the legend that is yuta watanabe so it evens out imo
pos,Neg,man raptors fans seem so damn chill not a single comment trash talking the sixers but instead talking about how good maxey was we need more fanbases like this
pos,Pos,gg raps very well played these honourable losses are only gonna take us so far
neg,Neg,og clutched that game gotta pass to scottie more though
pos,Pos,cj would absolutely cremate cats in this sixers system
pos,Pos,fvv giving sixers fans some kawhi flashbacks at the end there
neg,Pos,scottie barnes the only guy who has almost as many offensive rebound as defensive rebounds half the time if he was stat padding for defensive rebounds he would have 15 a night
neg,Neg,og sent those assists via his agency klutch sports
neg,Neg,fred so dominant he is celebrating with paying a fine
pos,Pos,fred vanvleet sr
neg,Neg,sure the block on precious might have been wrong but lets not act like drummond didn t have a ton of fouls not called
pos,Pos,idk bout yall but i feel like maxey could be the pg sixers lookin for just ship simmons for any type of hall which takes the load off embiid and they probably a contender
neg,Neg,maxey is a star can t believe a mile muscala buzzer beater got us this man
neg,Neg,wish the nba would revise those challenges with jump balls it stopped momentum with an absurdly long review forced a jump ball after our fast break opportunity and led to the 3 that was the difference feel like in that scenario the team with the rebound should probably get to inbound oh well fun game lots of runs by both sides one hell of a battle for fvv vs maxey
neg,Neg,thank god for that scottie block at the end
neg,Pos,this is the type of game raptors would ve lost last season woo happy they won they showed resilience down the stretch great poise by og making those plays happen by driving in the paint scottie b was great in the 3rd mykhaliuk was making those little great plays and this was easily chris boucher s best game of the season also tyrese maxey is relentless i swear he s the basketball version of speedy gonzalez
neg,Pos,this win was for kyle lowry s mom
pos,Pos,maxey s floater ray allen s corner 3
neg,Neg,that van vleet 3 took about four bounces before it went down four bounces
pos,Pos,i love andre drummond
neg,Pos,maxey and precious are at total opposite ends of the basketball iq spectrum
pos,Pos,grrr that blocked shot that had to be challenged ended the game
pos,Pos,tough ass game maxey was a beast og making those passes was beautiful to see trusting his teammates instead of forcing it
neg,Neg,that finish was stressfully exciting philly was killing it without embiid they re one scary team since when did ai return to the line up 33 points tonight
pos,Pos,maxey is insane
pos,Pos,what s with mods removing all the highlights of fvv celebrating and the plays leading to it salt i m confused
pos,Pos,sixers gotta send 4 guys to guard that corner of the court we all know the raps have burned them from there before lol
neg,Neg,almost had a raptors moment there
pos,Pos,what a game maxey is legit gg sixers although i was dissapointed i didnt see lowry simmons and embiid play tonight
neg,Neg,when the block was overturned why was it a jumpball the 76ers had possession after the block that jumpball led to a raptors 3 which swung the momentum
pos,Pos,fred van vleet has playing his best basketball of his career this season
pos,Pos,fvv gtj and barnes looked good again dalano was a steal in the second round maxey genuinely looked unstoppable today against us too well done 76ers for managing to replace and all nba level player with someone who has such a heigh ceiling too
neg,Neg,paul reed needs more minutes
pos,Pos,ben proved doc right im glad new guys get to shine now
pos,Pos,when s the last time a team won scored 100 points but had no players with double digit assists or rebounds
neg,Neg,raps won maxey killed it for my fantasy team double win tonight
pos,Pos,maxey dropped two straight 30 point games in the beginning of the season didn t simmons had only one 30 point game for the whole season last year
pos,Pos,can we haf team plz
neg,Neg,damn maxey is a fcking stud
pos,Pos,not a philly fan or anything but thank fuck for ben and his being completely incapable of handling his shit because maxey is showing out
pos,Neg,sorry if i missed it but was tyrese maxey in the top 75
neg,Neg,that s the covid spreading 76ers to you
neg,Pos,perhaps the most infamous fartomaniac was adolf hiter i wrote about hitler in a previous blog on coprophilia but according to his medical reports hitler is believed to have suffered from uncontrollable flatulence the reason for this is thought to have been hitler s regular and seemingly relentless diet of prescription drugs and illicit drugs his medical records also indicated that he took up to 28 different drugs to attempt to restrain his excessive flatulence an article in intelligent life magazine noted that medical historians are unanimous that adolf was the victim of uncontrollable flatulence spasmodic stomach cramps constipation and diarrhea possibly the result of nervous tension had been hitler s curse since childhood and only grew more severe as he aged as a stressed out dictator the agonising digestive attacks would occur after most meals
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,covid refs simmons im really not enjoying the gangbang that came with this season
pos,Pos,i m officially a maxi pad believer
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,horrific refereeing performance but the raptors refused to let themselves be robbed
neg,Neg,i will never forget all the raptors fans thumping their chests about masai built different ujiri sending a message to the league not to low ball him when we offered green maxey and a 1 at the deadline and then those same fans saying that the dragic precious trade was the same thing
pos,Pos,i feel like sixers lost that game more than the raptors won it
neg,Pos,what a crazy ending wow
pos,Pos,fred made the clutch shot to close it out but him and og also shot us out of having the lead can t keep freezing scottie out of the offense every game worked out this time but everytime fred has a game like this he s generally in for a stinker afterwards especially after playing 40 mins on a b2b
neg,Neg,i wish we weren t losing 95 of our team
pos,Neg,maxey gave me heart attacks
neg,Pos,maxey and freddy balled out
neg,Neg,the rims hate philly
pos,Pos,that game was intense
pos,Pos,fred looks a little bit like a mix between i want to say drake and dj khaled
pos,Pos,big balls energy freddy
pos,Pos,might be one of the most fun games for us all season got a little stressful at the end there but we closed it out tyrese maxey is legit though star potential
pos,Pos,we should have precious play like pj tucker and have him work on an offensive tool in the offseason so we can get more touches on og scottie
pos,Pos,as someone with both fred and maxey on my fantasy team i m definitely going to sleep happy
pos,Pos,this hurt lol
pos,Neg,fred van huge balls
pos,Pos,fred vanvleet
neg,Neg,every once in awhile i get mildly sick when i think about how we drafted josh green in front of people like maxey bey and bane as far as i can tell he has maybe been the biggest bust from the first round of that draft
pos,Pos,when will danny get his damn ring lol
pos,Neg,listening to the sixers commentators at the end there hurt from the drummond block to the no reaction for trent jr and vanvleet s threes damn man
pos,Neg,toronto is looking good this season on a side note maxey is nuts
neg,Neg,maxey was awzum and wow boucher finally played like a nba player
pos,Pos,fredderico with the cajones
pos,Pos,the atlantic division is brutal this season
pos,Pos,guess this scottie barnes dude is actually kinda good at basketball huh
pos,Neg,boucher shot well
pos,Pos,remember when the raptors rejected an offer of maxey and a 1st for half a season of lowry bet the sixers are glad the raptors turned that down
neg,Neg,not to state the obvious but everyone and their brother who saw this game knows for a fact that ben simmons would have gotten the w
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,i loved fvv s 3 at the end the fact that it had some bounce action to remember the sixers fans of past deeds make it specially awesome
pos,Pos,we gave up 15 offensive rebounds 5 of them to 6 1 tj mcconnell
neg,Neg,great win for the pacers the back to back in denver and utah is the very definition of schedule loss
pos,Pos,we had a combined 4 rebounds from players listed as forwards oneale bojan and pashcall just pathetic effort on the boards from the team in general just standing around hoping rudy will just grab everything mcconell had 5 offensive rebounds and at least 3 of them were almost completely uncontested
neg,Neg,i was nervous that we would blow our lead and lose the game even with gobert ingles and mitchell out the jazz crowd really got into it
pos,Pos,myles got 3 guys ejected dpoy in my book
pos,Pos,pacers fans i still like you guys and your team despite whatever the hell just happened
pos,Neg,myles with the solid 3 0 kda that s my dpoy
pos,Pos,short pgs getting more rebounds over tall stifle towers like we all expected
pos,Pos,hands up if you had the pacers and jazz getting into a multi ejection fight on your nba bingo cards now put your hands down you liars
neg,Pos,the idea of trading myles turner is better than trading myles turner
pos,Pos,pacers win post joe pera
pos,Pos,really looked as if the jazz were the team on the road back to back
pos,Pos,mike conley still has never had a technical foul
neg,Neg,gobert seems super threatened by the presence of myles turner
neg,Neg,so long as it s just flagrants for rudy and don i d be happy joe is defs getting suspended saying we played like ass would be an insult to butts love seeing don play well but really we need to get out of our own heads now
pos,Pos,after myles blocked rudy for the 3rd time tonight rudy tried to depants myles
pos,Pos,i ll say it again the pacers are tj mcconnell s team
pos,Neg,what a shitshow gg pacers
pos,Pos,refs you get a technical you get a technical everybody gets a technical ps duarte is one smart basketball player
pos,Pos,hug me brother
pos,Pos,i m convinced there are two bad teams in the east and everyone else is some level of good this regular season is going to be a dogfight
pos,Pos,jazz fans we still love you keep being pacers west we ll keep being jazz east
pos,Pos,dana white drawing up those ufc contracts as we speak helluva fight gentlemen
pos,Pos,first jazz game i got to watch this year and not impressed really slow feet lackadaisical mental game and some strange offensive drives
neg,Pos,pacers rule
pos,Pos,gobert fights exactly like i envisioned he would
pos,Pos,brogdon
pos,Pos,pave
pos,Pos,well that was dumb
pos,Pos,jazz gave indiana way too many easy baskets this game especially in second chance buckets refs weren t calling shit either and indiana was playing super physical clearly frustrated our players but if that s how it s gonna be they need to be just as physical as the other team and they didn t do that
neg,Neg,what a absolute odd game
neg,Pos,bojan royce conley and clarkson were absolutely garbage tonight even remotely average performances from them and we win
pos,Pos,that was a bar fight craig
pos,Pos,wish i could erase this game from memory i have never seen a team of this caliber play so fucking bad the opposing rebounds made us look like we were playing 10 on 3 shits inexcusable
neg,Pos,beastern cofnerence
pos,Pos,i was watching the highlights and realized i missed a battle between the two greatest screen assist practitioners in the league
pos,Neg,lol i had the over for dmitch at 26 5 i was 5 away from 3k
pos,Pos,jazz are really bad
pos,Pos,2 5 games up on the jazz and more than a tenth of the season done spooky
neg,Neg,good win pacers
neg,Neg,jazz are frauds 6 2 sg no offense c
pos,Pos,didn t mike conley used to be good wtf happened
pos,Pos,22 points in the fourth quarter for kyle lowry what a beast
pos,Pos,the way to beat the clippers don t have a double digit lead
neg,Neg,booty man won t go away
pos,Pos,i would like to never face kyle lowry again thank u very much goodbye
pos,Pos,i like how reggie jackson had 0 points in the first half and 22 in the second half
neg,Neg,dunca really needs to get his shit together
pos,Pos,we came back from 17 down jesus the first quarters are killing me
pos,Neg,battalion
pos,Pos,clippers really love going down by 20 making teams feel confident and the storm back to win being a fan of this team is a roller coaster of emotions
pos,Pos,paul george is so good on defense
pos,Pos,the refs really hate pg but ball don t lie
pos,Pos,someone make a highlight reel of all of batum s steals and defensive stops dude deserves fucking all nba defensive
pos,Pos,clippers still get to add kawhi to this team insane
pos,Pos,this clippers team plays so much heart it s crazy to see the difference between this team and previous clippers teams that would fold in moments like this
pos,Pos,getting harder and harder not to be mad at duncan kyle lowry is a god gg clips pg for mvp
neg,Neg,when the clippers get the w i get a little chubby dude
pos,Pos,batum was 3atum last game today he was deflection goat
pos,Neg,paul george is so smooth
pos,Pos,pg man
pos,Pos,batum having an all star level year i love this clippers team so much so much fun to watch amazing intensity on both sides of the court if we get kawhi back this year
neg,Pos,such a good game from both sides clippers suffocating defense after the first quarter lowry taking over in the 4th mvpg as always clippers role players are probably one of the best in the league great game from bam but lowry in the 4th looked like the best player on the floor tough fought out game by the clippers back from a 17 pt deficit
pos,Pos,i have never spoken an ill word in regards to bledsoe i ve always said he s my favorite clipper
pos,Pos,clippers had the better white shooters luke kennard and duncan robinson
pos,Pos,what in tarnation was that pass
neg,Pos,drob might need to cancel his podcast at this rate
pos,Pos,kyle lowry and his dumptruck frighten me
pos,Pos,bam is literally unstoppable so let s stop getting him the ball the miami heat guards tonight
pos,Pos,herro had a single shot in the 4th after being half the reason we were even in the game while robinson took 7 i think shots in the 4th and bricked them all after being deadweight all season
pos,Pos,what happened to robinson
pos,Pos,please get your shit together duncan
pos,Pos,kyle lowry can t win with these cats
pos,Pos,well that looked familiar
pos,Neg,no ot tonight
pos,Pos,our lord and savior nicoooooooooooooooo also fuck the ringer
neg,Pos,gg heatbros great game
pos,Pos,i knew me spreading mvpg propaganda all season would bite me on the ass
pos,Pos,nba tv broadcast is ass multiple times they just cut to commercial in the middle of action
neg,Neg,heat have lost 3 in a row and 4 of their last 5 games
pos,Pos,shout out to the heat fans who said that clippers is a cake walk and easy to beat
pos,Pos,reggie jackson is a god
pos,Neg,kept expecting the heat to get gassed they probably did a bit with that shooting but those dudes fought especially lowry deciding to become unstoppable
neg,Pos,ty clippers
pos,Pos,i love eric bledsoe and i don t care who knows it
pos,Pos,duncan has the yips
pos,Pos,valiant effort for us on the second night of a back to back against two good teams lowry is that dude even these losses without our best player have been promising dunc got the yips or something but we gonna be alright good game clips
pos,Pos,is robinson the worst volume 3 point shooter edit guys i wasn t being serious lol
pos,Pos,duncan robinson singlehandedly gave the 2 la teams the w
pos,Pos,stupid inbound pass at the end ruins a great game smh
pos,Neg,lowry s a dog almost won them that game
pos,Pos,are the clippers good
pos,Pos,robinson is 5 26 in his 2 la games unlucky slump
pos,Pos,still not convinced by the heat their offense isn t good
pos,Pos,i wanna thank drob for his part in the win but seriously gg heat that was an amazing game
pos,Pos,signed duncan got trashcan smh
pos,Pos,i don t like duncan anymore
pos,Pos,trade duncan
pos,Pos,lowry cursing his useless teammates
pos,Pos,la b2b has to stop lmao
pos,Pos,duncan robinson down to 31 2 on threes for the season 34 for 109 not fun
pos,Pos,duncan cost us 2 games in a row absolute shambles
pos,Pos,bledsoe finally looking like an nba player again
pos,Neg,0 2 clippers one of the greatest teams of all time
pos,Pos,struggling lakers same record as the hottest team in the league heat
pos,Pos,respectfully lets fucking gooooooooooo
neg,Pos,two three point losses in two night against the lakers and clippers couldn t write it better i guess
pos,Pos,damn that was a hell of a game without jimmy too
pos,Neg,the heat have played some entertaining close games in la for the past couple of days
pos,Pos,this was not the l a trip the heat imagined
pos,Pos,is no one gonna talk about the fact that the bledshow got 21 pts lol that s your quarterly good game from him hopefully he has more performances like this bc the clips need it
neg,Pos,clippers they re lucky if they make the play in without kawhi heat the heat are legit contenders
pos,Pos,i hate that we blew that 17 lead by doing a 2 man game with lowry and a bum who cant shoot for sht in q2 but at least lowry redeemed himself in 4th quarter as always duncan lost us this game just like last night
pos,Pos,i thought duncan was a 3 point specialist
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,unfortunately banned from the heat sub after mocking them for thinking how hard the photo op of their squad was standing outside the lockerroom but i feel bad for them tonight that final 3 miss from duncan was pretty dumb even if he was open had 12 seconds to figure something out no
pos,Pos,lets be honest the real reason the heat were still in the game at the end was bc the clippers took bledsoe out at the start of the 4th also duncan going full time podcaster helped edit did i really need the s i was joking yall come on
pos,Pos,great win for the clips but miami is for real lowery proving that every team in the league should have tried for him over the summer
pos,Pos,so when miami is 7 5 nobody talks about it but when lakers are 7 5 you all want to fire vogel and trade westbrook
pos,Pos,where was that stupidly locked in tough guy
pos,Neg,i miss kyle s fourth quarter masterpieces so much sad we didn t get to see lowry hitting a ridiculous three to tie it up
pos,Pos,miami is overrated
neg,Neg,heat this the team that s supposed to be scary lmaooo straight doo doo
pos,Pos,heat with 3 straight l s you love to see it
pos,Pos,herro was bad in last night and tonight s ending
pos,Pos,i didn t watch this game what the fuck
neg,Neg,bledsoe heard y all talkin shit
pos,Pos,so who s complaining about fouls now this game i wasn t able to watch
pos,Pos,kyle lowry went nuts
neg,Neg,lets go cliyyyyyupps
neg,Neg,stop paying one dimensional shooters wtf is wrong with these front offices
pos,Pos,wellcome to lla
pos,Pos,heat bench is a big weakness
pos,Pos,since the celtics dad dicked them they heat havent been the same
pos,Pos,morris still out
pos,Pos,been a tough wc trip for miami they ve been taking l s left and right
pos,Pos,bam is fantastic robinson is really streaky herro isn t a leading guy the rest of the miami bench is ass not sure how but the clippers have turned reggie jackson into a good player are they going to do the same thing with bledsoe
neg,Pos,so happy bledsoe is playing well i miss him
pos,Pos,heat stay taking l s on this road trip
pos,Pos,if prefer the clippers were bad
pos,Pos,living legend kyle lowry
neg,Pos,ayyyyyyyy fuck the heat talking all that shit daaaaaaaaa bawwwwwwwwk
pos,Pos,jokic owns bam
neg,Pos,miles bridges answering toppin s windmill dunk with one of his own is the best thing i ve watched this season so far
pos,Pos,17 rebounds 9 assists and 5 steals by lamelo is some ridiculous stat stuffing in the last 30 years it s only been done one other time jokic in 2017
pos,Pos,the energy at the arena looked amazing
pos,Pos,hi i m the knicks bench and i have directv hi i m the knicks starters and i eat paint chips
pos,Pos,having expectations fucking sucks
neg,Neg,so who is okc going to throw their max at bridges or ayton
pos,Pos,4 of our 5 starters combined for 28 points nothing else to say hornets are fun to watch love playing y all
pos,Neg,the fact that we have four semi star ballhogs and mitchell robinson who flub the fucking game every time and have to be saved by derrick rose and his merry men is fucking annoying ofc drose gets hurt and we lost all momentum randle comes in and i don t even want to talk about what happened
pos,Pos,this hornets team compared to the 2019 one is just worlds apart in play style and talent
neg,Pos,it s genuinely crazy to me that lamelo played against rj barrett as a 13 year old freshman and now they re both playing against each other in the nba lol jeez time fucking flew edit for the uninformed
pos,Pos,miles bridges really pulled it together in the 4th that spin layup on randle was fucking dirty
neg,Neg,damn lamelo filled the stat sheet
pos,Pos,miles bridges
pos,Pos,that is all edit maybe a coincidence or not but at this point of the season 10 yrs ago during the 2011 12 season was also a struggle at this point of the season where we went 6 7 and stayed at mediocrity until linsanity happened weeks later i m not saying that s gonna happen again but we really need something big to happen whether its a starting lineup change signing acquisition etc for us to make this season promising like we had intended just a few weeks ago
pos,Pos,lamelo out here tryna be westbrook lol but actually worked well for us also randle shall now be known as mr choker as he bricked 3 free throws in clutch
neg,Neg,i liked melos defence tonight he played alot harder then he usually does you could see the dawg in him such a great game of basketball superenjoyable really
pos,Pos,watched with my grandparents my grandmother says that our new jerseys look like a kid s mermaid tail outfit and i can t unsee it
pos,Neg,yea let s sub out our bench that has just brought us back to the game for the 10th time this season for beyblade and negative defense kemba and you know what fuck obis windmind let s bench his ass too this is what happens when we don t sign frank back we go from best defense in the league to dog shit
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,bing bonk
pos,Pos,i thought this was the year knicks would coast into the playoffs must be eternal pain as a knicks fan
neg,Neg,toppin randle
neg,Neg,i know all the talks are about melo and miles but watching the box score i think hayward had quietly a good game can someone tell me how is he doing so far this season bcuz last year before his injury i was low key rooting for me to have a resurgence at the all star game
pos,Pos,congrats thibs you played yourself by bringing in back the starters at the end of the game the bench was showing more effort and heart rj and randle were fucking bums what a disappointment to kemba s 28 point game
pos,Pos,wild dubious handle sighting
pos,Pos,i swear to god if we somehow figure out how to put 4 quarters together in one game we d take the 2016 warriors and the 96 bulls no problem
pos,Pos,bing bong per sources
pos,Neg,the knicks backups should be starting they re better than the current starting lineup
pos,Neg,bonkkk
pos,Pos,toppin got topped eric collins
pos,Neg,i m going to watch the ugliest pornstar i can find tonight she ll still put on a better show and better effort than our starters and if she s also a brainless hoe that switches things up when it s finally working for me imma assume it s one of thibs relatives
pos,Pos,i didn t rate the hornets city jerseys at first but seeing them in action they look really cool
pos,Pos,bing bonk
pos,Pos,behind lamelo s 17 rebounds yeah thats why they won
neg,Neg,god the starting lineup gets so insufferable a good amount of the time
neg,Neg,this team fucking sucks
pos,Pos,man the starters really need to get it together this shit is getting ridiculous if rose doesn t tweak his ankle and mess up the bench unit i think we win that i ll go full homer we have the best bench in the nba good game though the obi windmill into miles windmill was crazy better pay that man
pos,Neg,helluva game
neg,Neg,the highlight of the game was when eric collins said that tom thibodeau eric said tom always looks like he ate a bad plate of sausages in my opinion he looks like the cousin of the penguin played by danny devito in the batman movie
pos,Neg,didn t watch the game but randle and rj combined 12 points on 24 fga is fucking brutal
pos,Pos,gg
pos,Pos,be good to kemba he s our dad
pos,Pos,i know it was a hard season for you non knicks last year because we went to the playoffs but i have good news for all of you the knicks suck again and are yet again the joke of the nba enjoy it since i made a huge mistake of believing in this fucking franchise never again so it s back to the lottery and wasting draft picks fun
pos,Pos,never seen a post game thread saying they were led by rebounds lolll
pos,Neg,the knicks starting lineup constantly squandering the great performance of their bench is my new favorite wrinkle this season
neg,Pos,hornets commentators are overly bias and it gets annoying sometimes fite me
pos,Pos,knicks are a play in team
pos,Pos,we d look like a much better team if the 2nd half was just ignored every game
neg,Neg,bruh
neg,Neg,another stinker from rj and even worse wtf is going on
pos,Pos,mannnnnn i don t even want to remember this night
neg,Neg,i m not sure if randle will recover from last season s playoff debacle he s just so frustrating
pos,Neg,knicks starters except kemba walker call lsu louisiana state
pos,Pos,life is pain didn t even watch this game we ve just been disappointing our starters need to figure things out we traded defense for offense in free agency and it s been biting us in the ass our bench has been amazing our starters have been trash barrett has has had some pretty good games the rest of the starters have been pretty bad
pos,Pos,schröder getting mvp chants this game is exactly what i was expecting
pos,Pos,ugly ass game but a win is a win
pos,Pos,thank god for schroeder
pos,Neg,as much as i freaking love jrue he has a bad habbit taking lots of shots from time to time its like last year in the first 2 rounds he can literally shot you out of the game by himself he is an amazing player but offense aint his super strong card do what u are best
pos,Pos,ugly fucking game but a win s a win schroder turned the ball over way too much but he also had 38 so i don t think anyone s gonna blame this one on him gotta stop playing down to our competition but we re 4 1 in the last five just keep that momentum going
pos,Pos,the boston celtics obliterate the defending champion milwaukee bucks behind winning performances from team leaders jayson tatum and marcus smart the celtics held superstars giannis antetokounmpo and khris middleton to zero points combined this was all done without jaylen brown who was suspiciously absent from the celtics lineup with what is alleged to be a hamstring injury this performance begs the question are the celtics better without jaylen brown and certainly gives support to the whispers of respectable but as of yet unnamed r nba shitposters who insist that a jaylen brown for ben simmons trade is imminent
pos,Pos,second straight game where time lord led boston in in a win
neg,Neg,holy shit jrue had a rough shooting night
pos,Pos,grayson allen gonna be hated by every single fan base by the time he retires
neg,Neg,bucks team is deeeeeep
pos,Pos,oh well bucks almost had it feels anticlimactic to force ot and then not come close to winning celtics big dogs came to play
pos,Pos,that was a fun fucking game
pos,Pos,schröder redemption arc
pos,Pos,give schroder 84 mil
pos,Pos,really proud of the effort in what really should not have been a close game that s definitely something you can build on when the team gets healthy
pos,Pos,remember when people were talking about how schröder was going to end up in china
pos,Pos,how many ot games is that for the cs 4 5
neg,Pos,thoroughly enjoyed this game especially with hubie commenting but i m high as fuck and im glad its over so i can watch national treasure just found that shit on disney and i havent watched it years so excited
pos,Neg,damn if this schroeder showed up in the playoffs he mighta just gotten that 100mil
pos,Pos,connaughton was feeling it in the 3rd even yammed it to let fockers know
pos,Pos,the milwaukee herd took the celtics to overtime i ll take it also the causasian sensation is real
pos,Pos,jrue was really out there building
pos,Pos,schroder for president i guess
neg,Neg,wisconsin herd were pretty spooky tonight
pos,Pos,schroder s contract is so ridiculous
pos,Pos,schroeder is one of the most predictable guards in the league and he destroyed us tonight good grief still not a bad loss gg celts
pos,Pos,dennis is gonna play himself to a comparble contract to what he missed out on this off season also first time hearing him speak his accent is mad cute
pos,Pos,boston held giannis to 0 points pretty impressive
pos,Pos,big brain injury strategy our bench squad is going to be a well oiled machine
pos,Pos,that ot was a massacre
neg,Pos,please stop giving wasting game winner attempts by handing the ball off to tatum and letting him dance around for 20 seconds then throw up a brick
pos,Pos,that s tuff
pos,Pos,d e n n i s
neg,Pos,you can talk about schroder all you want but the bucks getting grayson for the a 60th draft pick guy and a future second rounder is complete thievery not entirely sure if it s correct
pos,Pos,dennis the menace man crazy night
pos,Neg,schroder has legit played amazing this season on both ends
pos,Pos,nice work by the bucks to stay in it and force ot schroeder was impressive in the stretch run there
pos,Neg,dennis the 80 million dollar man
pos,Pos,sorry bucks but that s tuff
neg,Neg,was in person at the game and it was great but realistically i feel like this really doesn t bode well for the c s even with jaylen if giannis middleton and lopez hell just giannis or middleton play and i think this is a bucks blowout
pos,Pos,that s tuff
pos,Pos,bro what the fuck is wrong with jayson tatum his iso possession in the clutch are fucking awful how has he not learned what a bad strategy that is by now he looks like westbrook out there
neg,Neg,that was a great fun game to watch as a neutral
pos,Pos,well that was ugly but at least the c s managed to win real worried about this team for tomorrow though since they ll have to travel to cle and play the second end of a b2b after playing an ot game the night before
pos,Pos,dennis the menace might have the best contract in the league in terms of quality and value
pos,Pos,hubie brown born during the great depression and is still bringing it
neg,Pos,the boston celtics are on pace to play 27 overtime games this season
pos,Pos,i just turned the game on and i caught semi scoring a bucket and was happy for a split second before realizing the truth
pos,Pos,schroder should ve taken the last shot dude was scorching
pos,Pos,bucks playing fake giannis no brook no middleton and the celtics barely survived hope the cavs can do better than that tomorrow bucks might be 6 6 but once everyone returns they will get 1st seed
pos,Pos,celtics are quietly winning games and asserting themselves as one of the better teams in the east
pos,Pos,holy shit where was this schroder in la
pos,Pos,boston is finally getting it together
pos,Pos,25 fga with 1 assist tatum is a fucking ball hog
pos,Pos,bucks under 500 what s going on
pos,Pos,don t get so excited about schroeder bucks had no rim protection at all so any quick slasher could have had the scoring he had tbh
pos,Pos,i fell asleep this went to ot celtics are not gone have a good season
neg,Neg,good win for the celtics when both teams were missing their best player
pos,Neg,that s their 5m man right there
pos,Pos,schroeder eviscerated us
pos,Pos,dennis the menace
pos,Pos,i never doubted dennis schroder
pos,Pos,shouldn t have ever gone to ot but nice to see the guys step up in the extra period
pos,Pos,when did semi go to the bucks btw i guess i did see a goodbye boston vid but didn t know he signed with mil
pos,Neg,schroder with the mvp chants at the end
pos,Pos,thank god
pos,Neg,how do you make schroeder look good
neg,Neg,dennis out here trying to get his bag
pos,Pos,holiday rough night
pos,Pos,oh giannis sat out
pos,Neg,the bucks are 6 7 rn why is no one shitting on them all i see is lakers bad warriors good memes
neg,Neg,2 brain farts from jrue and bobby lmfaoo
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,are my celtics finally back
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,at what point does jason tatum fix things 10 25 is shit and 1 assist in 41 minutes
neg,Pos,i haven t check the bucks in a while and they re below 500 what happened
pos,Pos,they did all that without giannas and middleton lol the cs are garbage
neg,Pos,mobley starting to learn that slow bigs just can t stay with him watch out
pos,Pos,mobley is a franchise player right now garland is starting to look like a stud core looking strong okoro needs a shooting coach immediately elite defense but the shooting is going to kill him if we ever make the playoffs
pos,Pos,evan mobley is a basketball
pos,Pos,i don t think it can be overstated how much of an impact rubio s had on the team the ball movement is so much better this year than last year and guys are genuinely playing for one another it s fucking great to watch
pos,Pos,mobley is so good man
pos,Pos,i don t know how long this will last or if we re legitimate playoff contenders or not but it s so nice to have such a fun team to watch again
pos,Pos,34 51 minutes played from both darius and mobley as well do we got something brewing here
pos,Pos,if we kept our starters in we might ve kept them under 70 tbh
neg,Neg,this score doesnt tell how bad the pistons played today they couldnt hit anything and cavs defense was solid good confidence boost for the next extremely hard stretch of games that will feature warriors celtics nets
pos,Pos,evan is separating himself from the other in the roy race i think there is a little gap between him and whoever is n 2 rn i m happy for cleveland yall truly deserve this
pos,Pos,fun times in cleveland again
pos,Pos,is evan mobley the next tim duncan
neg,Pos,cavs are so fun to watch man so much ball movement it s refreshing after watching the post lebron cavs seasons before this
pos,Pos,this cavs team might honestly be the surprise of the season by a margin
pos,Pos,we may be better than the pistons
neg,Neg,mobley does something cool every time he is near or has the ball
pos,Pos,this is probably being extremely disrespectful to sexton but to me garland mobley allen are the real building blocks this team feels like it just flows perfectly with dg as the primary ball hander facilitator
neg,Neg,cavs warriors finals is inevitable
pos,Pos,dude cavs are exciting this year go cavs
pos,Pos,i like what i see from garland the rookie gets a lot of the headlines but darius has been consistent so far and he is the type of player i would circle as having a second half breakout where he may start delivering 30 point or 15 assists type of games i remember steph said he was gonna be legit
pos,Neg,fucking evan mobley is the truth man evan allen seems like a way better combo then turner sabonis lol
pos,Pos,i suppose if it s any consolation cade shot 50 from the floor which continues his trend of bettering his fg from his previous outing
neg,Neg,the day casey is gone i will be so fucking happy what a fucking shit coach
neg,Pos,this is the first bad team we ve played all year outside the lakers but they had lebron when we faced them and we absolutely demolished them even good offenses struggle against us but if you re a bad team and you ve gotta score deal with ja and mobley all night good luck
pos,Pos,considering garza was our only player above 6 10 i didn t think we would win but damn i didn t think it was gonna be this bad
neg,Pos,dasexmob
neg,Neg,that 3rd quarter defense made me hard
pos,Pos,mobley is so good
neg,Pos,mobley with that shawn marion stat line
pos,Pos,defense was on another level today okoro and mobley terrorized the pistons today allen and garland are studs still missing sexton s scoring i love this team
pos,Pos,warriors cavs rematch actually could happen this year
pos,Pos,my god mobley is good
pos,Pos,big big win
neg,Neg,i think detroit is staging a mutiny on the court i stand with them at this point
pos,Pos,could the cavs bench beat the pistons starters
pos,Neg,runs through cleveland
pos,Pos,what a shitshow with casey and diallo now we cant trade him till jan or march
pos,Pos,cade repeatin his college form with more turnovers than assists
pos,Pos,one down four to go
pos,Pos,lebron is getting excited im back baby
neg,Pos,we are the worst offensive team ever
pos,Pos,kevin love plays
pos,Pos,since when was everyone so into like i m genuinely asking seems like lately its been brought up alot more
pos,Neg,can anyone tell me how my boy garza looked has been this season
neg,Neg,pistons just showed me why i hate teams that tank for a franchise player and still manage to waste him
neg,Pos,bonga ish smith bag of chips for grant
neg,Pos,thanks god that nuggets didn t sign grant
pos,Pos,how the hell we don t have automod post game threads is beyond me
pos,Pos,this thread is dead just like me
pos,Pos,free sengun
pos,Pos,nurkic is probably the most unutilized player in the nba this season
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,this grizzlies defense neither grits nor grinds
pos,Pos,the demise of the suns has been greatly exaggerated lol
pos,Pos,we win the jevon carter memorial cup
neg,Neg,suns would lose if ad played only got 51 wins last season because every team in the league got injuries besides then they will fight for a play in spot
pos,Pos,damn suns on a lowkey 7 game winning streak after their slow start i guess no one gives a shit about them right now lol
pos,Pos,7 in a row to be 8 3 and 2nd in the west when ayton has been out for a lot of the season along with two important rotation pieces in cam johnson and shamet kind of struggling and or not being consistent is pretty huge to sum it up the suns are racking up wins and staying at or near the top of the western conference despite being very overlooked as a whole despite not playing the best in the sense that important players are either not playing or struggling a bit is huge and says it all about how strong this team really is
pos,Pos,this suns team is still a title contender whither people like it s or not
pos,Neg,this sub loves piling on the lakers but why is no one talking about the defending western conference champion suns being 1 3 i didn t realize until now that the suns are currently 1 3 why is no one talking about this they lost to a mediocre kings team a couple days ago and nearly lost by 30 pts to the trailblazers with a struggling damian lillard and from what i know they re just about fully healthy for anyone actively watching the suns this season what s the main reason for the early season struggles you would think they d have a bunch of momentum to start the season after their amazing finals run
pos,Pos,best start through 11 games of the monty era i think the death of the suns has been greatly exaggerated
pos,Pos,31 with 17 pts for booker i like that
neg,Pos,don t let the score fool you it wasn t that close
pos,Pos,why are we not taking about these 1 3 suns former finals participants
pos,Pos,lucky suns are the 2 seed in the west only because jamal murray isn t healthy frauds
pos,Pos,what is happening in this sub lol the suns are fresh off going to the finals are 2nd in the west have the 2nd best record in the league currently have the longest win streak and i don t see a single post about them in this sub for like a week this post is on the third page and i don t think i ve caught a single highlight post o_o gettin slept on hard
pos,Pos,inexplicable skid at home after beating some good teams and getting some respect that s grizzlies basketball this is our culture
neg,Pos,is it too late to tank cuz fuck that was ugly
pos,Pos,grayson allen ain t walking through that door
neg,Neg,fun game go suns
pos,Pos,finally 4 good quarters
pos,Pos,god damn that box score shows some team basketball
pos,Pos,lol memphis is gonna be lotto bound if they don t discover something called defense
neg,Pos,bro when did we stop playing defense why how the fuck we were good at that last year like i get that we have a very different starting lineup but most of these guys are decent individual defenders or at least were in the past hell it wouldnt even be as big of an issue if melton bane and kyle weren t all playing bad on offense too jjj not being consistent the other guys who werent in the rotation last year being awful konchar and ziaire our only consistently good player is ja
neg,Pos,suns are on a winning streak ever since ayton didn t play
pos,Pos,according to our sub monty is a garbage coach and the suns are a dumpster team because we didn t win by 50 starting to see why other fan bases don t like us
pos,Pos,so deandre ayton ewing theory
pos,Pos,we try so hard but it s just borderline impossible without zion and bi
pos,Pos,pelicans really played their fucking ass off tho i gotta say we almost blew that pels really wanted this win so i gotta give them credit kd and harden were just too much in the end
pos,Pos,so what it comes down to for the nets is this 1 is it a tight game in the last two minutes 2 does the other team have kevin durant or james harden
pos,Pos,that early 4th quarter squad that nash put in looked awful
pos,Pos,if we could just score more points than the opposing team then we might win more games
pos,Pos,i like how kd takes a backseat and still drops 28
pos,Pos,the way kd closed this game with harden at the end was just nasty
pos,Pos,you have to double team kd but you can t leave any of the other guys wide open either that man is just a cheatcode what can you even do against that
neg,Neg,we tried lol
neg,Pos,pelicans run in the 4th was damn impressive the nets bench is so weak but harden my god
pos,Pos,harden had a good game in a win way to ruin r nba s night
pos,Pos,y all let harden and kd be on the same team in the east bruh
pos,Pos,pelicans were crazy efficient thus game
pos,Pos,pelicans played hard
pos,Pos,i ll never forget the threads about harden at the beginning of this season mfs really upvoted dudes that said he d never be the same and i won t let anyone forget it
pos,Pos,30 points on 12 shots from kd last game 39 points on 19 shots from harden this game they re cooking
pos,Pos,raymond felton was excellent tonight
pos,Pos,glad we got the w but we almost blew a 21 point lead that was rough
pos,Pos,chet on the way
pos,Pos,kd is such a monster of a player this dude got badly injured 3 times returns doesnt sweat and dominates games
pos,Pos,the new orlean pelicans are kings of quality losses too bad they are still losses
pos,Pos,harden gonna heat up soon he just gettin started gettin the rust off that injury looked great today
neg,Neg,nash trusted the bench a little too much this game
pos,Pos,harden will be fine this sub is full of reactionary morons
pos,Pos,james harden is officially back y all gg pelicans played hard
pos,Pos,39 points from harden thats my guy
pos,Pos,it was only a matter of time until harden pops off
pos,Pos,despite steve nash s best efforts the nets won this game
pos,Pos,harden kd is basically a greater version of those russ kd teams where they carried their team to the conference finals every year incredible to be able to see two top 5 scorers ever on the same team
pos,Neg,harden and durant both with 17 highly impactful game for both of them
pos,Pos,well that was significantly more stressful than it should have been fun to watch them kill it off at the end though
pos,Pos,huge performances from harden joe and kd on a night where no one else couldn t hit anything bruce and blake had some clutch buckets down the stretch when it mattered though
pos,Pos,nets have the same issue as in the bucks series they rely too much on their starting lineup
neg,Neg,kd gonna have his steph 16 year his numbers are shocking
pos,Pos,i understand why y all hate on him but seeing harden going back to his old self is so damn satisfying
pos,Pos,that was a fun comeback from the pels some awesome defense played there
pos,Pos,angry kd is fucking scary
pos,Pos,harden one of the true goats of the game people who don t realize this are actual idiots
neg,Neg,hardens back bois the 3rd reich will rise in brooklyn
pos,Pos,i thought harden was washed r nba told me so
pos,Pos,harden washed
pos,Pos,how is griffin not on the hot seat they might legit go 1 20
pos,Neg,am i crazy to think that the pelicans arent a terrible team the team all seems to try hard in all of the games that ive watched this season and jv is legit depending on t he timeline for bi and zion there might be a late run for play in
neg,Pos,james harden is still james harden
neg,Neg,we got to do something about the pelicans man
pos,Pos,fat boy feasting on some gumbo tonight do they serve gumbo at strip clubs in nawlins
neg,Pos,fuck kevin durant for missing that free throw and allowing no to cover
pos,Pos,will the pelicans win again
pos,Neg,blake griffin sucks during attacks i don t know how he constantly stays for long time in the game
pos,Pos,man nets 2nd lineup needs to figure it out opposing team s run always happened when the nets reserves plays
pos,Pos,james harden s honey buns
pos,Pos,good lord wut is you doin patty
pos,Pos,lmao looking at the pels roster they look underwhelming anddd lack depth like sheesh pick a struggle garrett mf temple was ya second leading scorer
pos,Pos,pelicans want that pick
neg,Pos,bench finally came to earth but that doesnt happen without no playing like they are the super squad the fact nash didnt already have counters to kd double teams ready is a touch worrisome
pos,Pos,nets need more of that james harden for sure
pos,Pos,anyone else lose a bunch of money on kd missing that free throw
neg,Neg,hopefully we get a superstar back soon god this is painful
neg,Neg,never change pelicans
pos,Pos,send the pelicans to seattle jesus christ
pos,Pos,kp from the logo
pos,Neg,luka has been playing decent defense so far this season and i hope it stays that way that s all we need from him on that end
pos,Pos,well that was the worst we ve looked all season i figured we wouldn t be able to contain luka for three straight games and we realllyyyyyyy miss jakob
pos,Pos,luka and kp play with this chemistry the rest of the year and we can beat anyone
pos,Pos,tingus
neg,Pos,tingus pingus
neg,Pos,kp real unicorn
pos,Pos,dynamic duo we ve been needing
pos,Pos,probably the best porzingod game i ve seen since the pelicans game pre covid
pos,Pos,idk if we are good top4 seed but we don t lose to bad teams
neg,Pos,we back
pos,Pos,here s your dallas mavs post game summary now in our 6th season 6 did the mavs win honestly one of our better wins of the season luka had his first triple double tonight with 32 12 15 2 with half of those dimes going to kp funnily enough shot just as good from 3 as he did from the ft line with 6 3 s kp with his best game so far this season and his best half as a mav with 23pts in the first half finished with 32 7 with 3 3 s and 2 of em being from the logo and one of those logo 3 s capping off his red hot half also had 3 recorded blocks felt like he had more than that tbh doe doe with 15 7 3 with 3 blocks 3 s bench analysis brunson burner adds to his 6moty campaign with 17pts tonight to lead the bench in scoring frank with a solid 2 3 s reggie with 7 4 2 steals overall a much needed win to bounce back from the loss again chicago on wednesday we don t play until monday against the nuggets
pos,Pos,dallas just has our number this year both defensively and offensively
neg,Neg,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray he ll bounce back
pos,Neg,we played terrible lmao
pos,Pos,every game mavs are getting better even the chicago beat down the w l record is generous but in 10 games or so i think they ll be deserving of it
neg,Neg,can we play the spurs every game
pos,Pos,the mavs are looking way better then i thought with the way y all talked about them
pos,Pos,i was told luka has a bad
neg,Neg,this is what us mavs fans want kp needed to be in their last 2 first rounds with luka
pos,Pos,idk how but i really appreciate that we re above 500 beginning the season
pos,Pos,behind luka s 32 12 15 wtf is this title man
pos,Neg,ahh the standard luka is back 30 point triple double almost 50 from 3 and 50 from the free throw line all is well in the world
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,eastern bloc
pos,Neg,spurs have like 100 guards good on kp on actually dominating these little guys for the first time in history
neg,Neg,this team fucking sucks dejounte is literally a shitty team hero he can t do shit when he has actual competition in front of him white is dead he doesn t even want to shoot anymore keldon has completely regressed most of the time i don t even know what the fuck he s doing on the court until he just bumrushes the paint like giannis s only move only difference is keldon isn t as big as giannis so it doesn t work drew thad are decent for what they do bryn is irrelevant when he fucks up pop doesn t even coach him anymore lonnie is a bust he s starting to become bryn 2 0 i m sure in a season or two he ll go to a different team and win a ring devin is the only good player left on this team and the only reason is because his 3 is propping him up the only good things about this game was listening to beadle talk about everything but the spurs and luka trying to fall into that young girls shirt fuck the spurts
neg,Neg,luka and kp garbage time gods
neg,Pos,finally some good fucking 3p
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,nuggets still haven t allowed 100 or more points at home
neg,Pos,i have never seen jokic miss this many jump shots in a game i think it must be a record for him despite that he was the best player on the floor by a wide margin who needs two max players when you have jokic
neg,Neg,if malone trusts a rookie as much as he s trusting bones you know they re special he s just always involved on both ends and i love it
pos,Pos,jokic ties bird in career triple doubles
neg,Neg,how does tim connelly keep getting away with this
pos,Pos,bones
pos,Pos,joker couldn t get that 20 20 trip dub what a scrub
neg,Neg,munder
pos,Neg,we need to fire nate and pick up nate bjorkgren then we will turn it around and make the ecf but lose in the off season the pacers will fire rick and promote lp to head coach next season we will start badly and fire nate b we will then hire rick who will turn us around and get us to the ecf in the off season the pacers fire lp hawks start off bad again then we fire carlisle and hire lp back the prophecy will then be complete and the hawks will begin a dynasty with lp back in charge this is travis schlenks plan
pos,Pos,not gonna go overboard but bones roty jokic mvp and ag is dpoy parlay them together bet your life s savings on it
pos,Pos,bones
neg,Neg,jokić larry bird 59 career triple doubles
pos,Pos,jokic is so good to watch it s like a walrus mixed with a ballet dancer
neg,Pos,booooooooones
pos,Pos,jokic is such a sigma male
pos,Pos,it s like we are back to 2018 2019 trae and jc playing well everyone else is awful
pos,Pos,nuggets are the definition of a well oiled machine
neg,Neg,aaron gordon is the mvp of this game if jokic didn t exist
pos,Pos,did you know that the atlanta hawks are a bad basketball team now you know
pos,Pos,i only been watching basketball since 2012 but jokic is by far the best centre i ve seen
neg,Pos,i love this team
neg,Neg,nuggets still haven t allowed 100 points in a home game
pos,Pos,hawks are back to john and trae carrying scrubs seriously how do you only get 2 points in a game with 20 min
neg,Neg,m
pos,Pos,trae and john are the only ones who look like they care so far this season perimeter d and defensive rotations absolutely suck and we cant consistently hit 3s to save our fuckin life anyone who looks at our record and uses it as an indictment on trae so far this year is trash
pos,Pos,m u n d e r
neg,Neg,that red wine and baby diarrhea hit different
pos,Neg,everyone outside of trae and jc should be ashamed of how they played on this road trip
pos,Pos,boooonesss yaaaaaaaa
pos,Neg,bones tho damn
neg,Neg,a guy like bones coming off the bench is going to be a difference maker during playoff time love watching the former vcu ram
pos,Pos,boys we may never win again but can i complain about this scheduling not only do we get to play the best teams in the league we do it on 3 back to backs and all on the road 9 road games to 4 home really and of course our next home set are back to backs
neg,Pos,god i love this nuggets team does any team have a more likeable stable of pgs than murray bones facu rivers
neg,Pos,ag is one of the best defenders in the league this year dude clamps everyone his fit with this team is perfect
neg,Pos,jokic td crushed it as always rest miami gave him was put to good use but finally had key backup in guys like bones love this kid what a rookie and ag sniper
neg,Pos,what the heck is going on with the hawks they started so hot reddish was balling hunter was playing good d and balling collins and trae were syncing up even though trae s number were down and capela was holding it down in the paint what happened i m genuinely curious that team is talented
neg,Pos,ag had a really good game as well
neg,Neg,so gordon decided to be good today fuck man i benched him in fantasy today for fucking huerter
pos,Neg,i thought we were a deep team we should have made a move when they had good trade value
pos,Pos,its nice to finally have a real good playmaker for the 2nd string bones sure doesn t look like arookie
neg,Neg,ag played so fucking good against trae young hopefully he will be able to lock down other high caliber pgs going forward cause we had some trouble against ja morant
pos,Pos,the hell is going on with the hawks
pos,Pos,has bones always been able to pass like that i knew he could shoot but those passes i see you my man
pos,Pos,ignore my flair here and i will preface this by saying that i m not worried about the hawks as i think eventually they ll end up alright i understand that they have a hard schedule to start the year but if they are truly a top tier talent of the east then they should at least be beating some of these teams in a close game and especially not double digit losses i haven t been watching most of their games beside the gsw one but what s the issue
pos,Neg,yo wtf happened to the hawks
pos,Pos,will we ever win a game again
pos,Neg,fuck you markieff morris
pos,Pos,trae and jc were good capela and delon wright were decent everyone else was absolute dogshit
pos,Pos,bones boner
neg,Neg,4 9 is pretty not good
neg,Pos,what s up with the hawks this year
pos,Pos,wtf happened to the hawks
pos,Pos,i m on team fire nate made us a mid range team and nobody but trae and jc showed up
pos,Neg,trae can t win with these cats
pos,Pos,hawks are 4 9 for a team poised to be top 4 in the east wtf
neg,Neg,the hawks are so bad their run in the playoffs last season was clearly a fluke
pos,Pos,so how about the hawks 13 games in it seems they are going back earth
pos,Pos,how bad was last years sixers collapse lol
neg,Pos,yo what s up with the hawks
neg,Neg,braves just won the ws falcons are actually decent georgias the best cfb team in the country no way in hell the hawks were gonna be good
neg,Neg,nice to see some kuminga minutes
neg,Pos,this warriors team is must watch tv playing absolutely beautiful basketball
pos,Pos,curry his shooting stats are so misleading the shots he takes and hits are just insane at times the fact that he shoots as high a percentage as he does with that kind of pressure continues to blow my mind
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,jfc those two dunks from kuminga
neg,Pos,my face after the first quarter my face after that lavine was the only one who could do anything offensively but he played so sloppy on to the next one
pos,Pos,some media members about to get glares from steve kerr tonight
pos,Pos,the warriors games are actual porn
pos,Pos,impressive but when do the warriors play the warriors until then i m not sold
pos,Neg,2015 all over again no clear title favorite gsw comes outta no where to win 67 games steph best player in the league and their depth is elite best show in sports
neg,Neg,andrew wiggins has been playing with intensity these last 2 games i liked the way he attacked on offense tonight even if he wasn t making some of the shots
pos,Neg,preface by saying i was so extremely hyped for this game first quarter was strong lavine was great and caruso played good defense 29 23 was an ideal start we got our scores by 12 in the second quarter not disastrous but bad third quarter was a disaster could barely score outside free throws so many dumb turnovers and we couldn t stop them at all defensively or on the offensive glass fourth quarter mostly kept it even got some nice plays but curry hit 40 easily ugly game from us hopefully a wake up game lavine went too long without a shot and turning it over way too much demar and lonzo went ice cold we couldn t get boards at all and defense wasn t as good as usual we need vuc back badly and man i wish pwill wasn t hurt will say the turnovers and some open missed shots hopefully won t happen again but man the warriors are even better than i predicted which was as wcsf all this without klay and wiseman so damn good looney is a better defender than i credited him for draymond is the same old guy and steph is the mvp
neg,Pos,steph has had 50 and 40 in 2 of the last 3 games and i still feel like hes not playing at his peak level yet lol
neg,Pos,i mean what can you do if the opposing point guard suddenly turns into curry
pos,Pos,my wife so is every game after this one going to be well they ll probably lose this one because the streak has to end at some point me yes but secretly i think she might be mocking me
neg,Neg,it s funny listening to dame cry about the new rules and watch steph continue to dominate but people think they re on the same level steph is one of the goats
pos,Pos,dread it run from it third qtr warriors still arrive
pos,Pos,oh god the warriors about to restart their dynasty aren t they
pos,Pos,i for one welcome our old warrior overlords i say we meet in the finals again for old times sake
pos,Pos,warriors are ok but they need to play the 1989 49ers at candlestick park first before i can say they are good
neg,Pos,only 4 more wins in a row and we ll have established ourselves as a good team
pos,Pos,can t wait to play this team 4 times this season or whatever
pos,Pos,stephen wardell curry of house bay 2nd of his name the skyfucker king of distance beyond the glade the unanimous holder of the 3 rings warlord of the first team breaker of records and father of the league
neg,Pos,eh not that impressed warriors have yet to play themselves can t judge them until they play a good team
pos,Pos,warriors are the best team in the league by far right now tonight also showed how big vucevic is for us even though he hasn t had his best shooting season so far we play through him a lot and his rebounding derozan and lavine didn t have their best games but i give full credit to that warriors defense really hoping klay comes back his usual self this team is championship level
pos,Pos,gsw is unfair man
neg,Neg,at this rate the only real team in the nba is going to be memphis get that finals mvp ja
neg,Pos,40 with only 1 ft m v p
pos,Pos,can t believe i thought this was gonna be down to the wire somehow this is the most fun the warriors have ever looked
neg,Pos,the warriors are a fucking buzzsaw man they shredded the bulls like it was for fun good luck league when klay comes back shits gonna be absurd
neg,Neg,3rd quarter warriors 4th quarter bulls now we know
pos,Pos,every nba fan needs to circle tuesday on their calendars because the gsw bkn game is shaping up to be an all time great regular season game
pos,Pos,ok but guys the warriors haven t even beaten the 96 bulls yet
pos,Pos,ayo somebody get me a clip of that last kuminga dunk
neg,Neg,the only way to beat the warriors be the memphis grizzlies
neg,Pos,curry came in to this game on a mission phenomenal all around game from the chef his defense in particular stood out today imo kuminga s one on one d is impressive for a rookie multiple bulls players tried to take him off the dribble only to call for a screen to force a switch showed off some nice handles and finishing ability too warriors started heavy trapping box and oneing lavine in the 3rd quarter and the bulls had no answer for it led to the warriors clamping the bulls in the 3rd and going on that massive run gpii is such a difference maker for the warriors insane he almost didnt make the roster for the corpse of avery fucking bradley bulls need to do a better job getting good looks for lavine he s their best player he shouldnt have to work so hard for looks all the time warriors run specific sets and plays to get curry open looks too get in rhythm bulls should look to do the same for lavine lavine also needs to work on his body language when shits not going right if the best player on the team starts hanging his head and giving off negative body language it hurts the rest of the teams morals which in turn hurts the teams ability to stabilize or come back lonzo might be the most hot and cold shooter ive ever seen dudes either 6 9 or 1 9 from three very little in between he also lack other scoring options so if he aint hitting hes pretty bad on offense bulls fought hard but were undermanned no vuc white or williams 3 out of 5 potential starters is hard to overcome they re a legit team imo just going through some growing pains rn oh and for all those people talking about how the warriors havent played anyone they just got lucky good teams take care of business lakers dropped 2 too okc utah dropped one to the magic etc edit oh and lavine needs to stop forcing it through double teams just ends in a to almost every time donovan has to do a better job prepping the team to handle lavine getting doubled cuz its gonna happen a lot
pos,Neg,warriors are legit and im getting vietnam flashbacks
pos,Neg,sorry bulls fans you will now not be considered a good team just to continue the media s narrative about gs
neg,Neg,otto the new wilt kuminga the new lebron wiseman the new admiral curry just curry gp2 the new gp1 poole the new ray allen bjelica the discount jokic
neg,Neg,can the warriors now have at least some respect from this sub and be regarded at least as contenders also shout out to that specific bulls fan who i will not name but starts with 1d who said this before the game gsw has a bunch on midgets that beat bad teams and nut kicker is washed he been washed washed donkey boy curry world class choke artist too 3 rings choke artist babyyyy most bulls fan especially their subreddit is pretty chill thou and respects gsw
pos,Pos,kuminga is going to be special
pos,Pos,did curry honestly have to go for 40 pts when he has 3 championships and 2 mvps already kinda cringe
neg,Neg,man i love this team we got shmacked and took it on the chin no excuses also i hope our sub can finally acknowledge that vuc despite his lower numbers is so vital to our entire offense some people thought we d be better without him
neg,Neg,its not gon show on stats but gp2 stopped lavine tonight
neg,Neg,new rules new ball and curry ain t complaining
pos,Pos,draymond with the loudest 9 points ever lmao
pos,Neg,so when do the warriors play one of these real teams everyone keeps talking about
neg,Neg,jesus christ kuminga gonna be really special and we still have klay coming in hopefully wiseman also took a leap
pos,Pos,how bout kuminga tho impressive perimeter d seems capable of handling the ball and ofc the athleticism is given
neg,Neg,y all wanna talk real ones 11 1 1st in the nba those are the real 1s
neg,Pos,okay warriors are officially back clicks tongue
neg,Neg,when will the warriors play an actual nba team also wwwwlwwwwwwwarriors
pos,Pos,i was impressed by kumingas hustle and rotations on d he seemed to belong out there more than i expected his d has to be the reason he s getting more real minutes than moody besides the fact that porter is a better moody rn
pos,Pos,turns out the grizzlies are the only good team in the nba
neg,Neg,defensive masterclass from the dubs today when draymond is playing like this he absolutely wrecks opposing offenses shout out looney and kuminga felt like bulls kept hunting those two and it was not a wise decision especially for demar also i love how this team rebounds despite an obvious lack of size at the center position beautiful gang rebounding
pos,Pos,apologies in advance for all the incoming obnoxious warriors fans get fucked league
pos,Neg,the mitten contained deballzach no violent explosion tonight
neg,Neg,it s tough to decide who s the best player between steph kd and giannis
pos,Neg,who is steph curry in math my solution in history my king in art my muse in science my oxygen in geography my world
pos,Neg,warriors respectfully humbling the bulls best team in the league right now by a mile
pos,Pos,loving the new curry minutes
pos,Pos,bulls are a good team but steph dropping 40 on a 31 vs lavine on 23 on a 19 is the definition of champion versus come up rooting for the bulls bit they have a long way to go
pos,Pos,it s official the warriors are back
pos,Pos,jesus 31 for mr wardell he could set a bpm record at this pace
neg,Pos,warriors are bringing back haunting memories especially in third quarters these warriors are legit and without kd its much more enjoyable to watch as its not a foregone conclusion that they re gonna win the chip
pos,Pos,gg bulls still love ya ll
pos,Pos,just give them the championship already and let s move on to next season gg wwwwlwwwwwwwarriors
neg,Pos,when klay returns sweet buddha
pos,Pos,steph is unreal
pos,Pos,i want klay to come back at 101 and to just watch the warriors destroy the league this year imagine how nasty it d be if they rocked the nets in the finals
pos,Pos,i m in love with the coco
pos,Pos,wait until warriors play a good team s
neg,Neg,did they play a good team yet tho
neg,Pos,r nba power rankers going to rank the bulls last to keep the narrative going lol
pos,Pos,any hawks fans got the scoop on what their announcers thought about currys 40 pts
neg,Pos,the bulls look stunned like a fighter after getting hit by a good left hook but there still young and growing so in the grand scheme it shouldn t effect them much in fact i think it was a good learning experience
pos,Neg,i m totally down to watch another 2 or 3 years of sky porn
pos,Pos,bron lucky he got his bubbo ring
pos,Pos,kuminga looking like the next pg kawhi hybrid
pos,Pos,before nephews say warriors won because vucevic is out klay and wiseman are also out welcome to the fucking show lol
neg,Neg,bulls fans complaining about curry getting weak foul calls he shot a single free throw with 40 points on 24 shots
neg,Pos,so uh warriors are winning the championship i guess lol i thought people were way overrating what klay would provide to this team after being gone for 2 years little did i know they don t even need him to be the best team in the league i can admit i was wrong
neg,Pos,steve kerr right now
pos,Pos,warriors still hasn t played a good team yet guys its all a fluke
pos,Pos,11 1
neg,Pos,the fact that steph might only now be entering his prime is honestly scary
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,gg dubs
pos,Pos,these warriors are making good teams look super silly and i got mixed feelings about this
neg,Neg,gonna be clampionship
pos,Pos,this thread is like 40 mins late
neg,Neg,you haven t fooled me yet wolves we ll blow the lead in the 5th quarter
neg,Neg,can i just say even though the lakers played bad tonight it wasn t as bad as the jersey matchup of neon green vs purple light blue
pos,Pos,i m convinced kat is really just steph curry standing on ray allen s shoulders
neg,Pos,how do you lose by 24 to the timberwolves lmaooo
pos,Neg,i still don t trust this lead
neg,Neg,this game was not as close as the score indicates
pos,Pos,carmelo with a 1 12 what happened
pos,Pos,this was for george mikan
neg,Pos,can t spell lakers without the l
pos,Pos,let a dude named big purr smoke us in front of the la hoes man
neg,Neg,wolves biggest lead was 33 in honour of westbrook s 33rd birthday
neg,Pos,the hell did i just watch
pos,Pos,completely deserved for wearing those trash jerseys
neg,Neg,kat was so good tonight looked like steph and hakeem at the same time
neg,Neg,i wish i watched this game to see this ass spanking
neg,Neg,everytime i think the lakers have had their worst loss they surprise me
pos,Pos,never a doubt in my mind that this year is pat bev s year not one ounce of doubt
pos,Pos,ironically russ 70 from the field and 66 from 3
pos,Neg,lebron is pushing 37 and this franchise is begging him to pull off another carry job it s insane they really want to make this like the dwightmare season
neg,Pos,kat
pos,Pos,rajon rondo was 17 in a 24 point loss and that s your funny stat for today
neg,Neg,people blaming westbrook but like it wasn t just him lol
pos,Pos,pay bev tricked y all
neg,Neg,you lost to the timberwolves lmaooo
neg,Pos,kat was incredible
pos,Pos,kat looked so smooth
neg,Pos,deandre jordan getting a dnp cd in a blowout finally vogel has seen the light
pos,Pos,wolves are so poverty man how do you not beat the 2021 lakers by 30
pos,Pos,someone remake this video but from this game lol
pos,Neg,kat is what ad thinks he is
pos,Pos,wtf even happened here
pos,Pos,i m gonna defend the lakers a bit here it s tough to win in the modern nba if one team is shooting lights out on threes like kat hit a off balance buzzer beat three with 0 5 left on the clock wtf and the other team is bricking everything yes they probably should ve switched up their strat but momentum is so big in a nba game and it s so easy to try to decide games by a shoot out we lost to orlando in the same fashion because we went cold they went hot at the right time with that said this lakers team doesn t play like a team of veterans they make so many dumb mistakes such as the 8 second back court call the flagrant by melo westbrook not attacking the switch on kat and the countless number of dumb turnovers they had they need lebron back badly i m also confused on why they went away from ad when we had vando defending him in the 3rd felt like they could ve abused that match up by giving ad easy buckets under the rim like they did in the first half
neg,Pos,pat bev was a huge factor tonight he set the defensive tone for the team lakers are trash
pos,Pos,before the season started i downvoted every comment that said the 2022 lakers would be like the 2013 lakers and lo and behold the 2022 lakers look way worse
neg,Pos,
neg,Pos,lakers lose world wins
pos,Pos,our sub really want to trade kat
pos,Pos,lakers were actually solid last year without lebron and even ad at times this teams role players are just a bad fit and have no chemistry or direction
neg,Pos,i m still chuckling at how many people thought the lakers were a serious contender this year come on look at that roster construction
neg,Neg,everyone get in here
neg,Neg,can espn and other sports media stop milking this lakers team we get it this team will be eliminated on the first round if this team stumbles to the playoffs you don t have to put a fucking segment every time the lakers play
pos,Pos,if the lakers need to rely on a 37 year old with a couple injuries in the last couple years it s gonna get ugly for them
pos,Pos,warriors blowing out the bulls lakers getting blown out by the timberpups today is a good day
pos,Pos,if towns keeps playing like he did in this game for the rest of the season then wolves can make some noise later on
pos,Pos,pathetic
pos,Pos,this is ant s team now kat sucks r nba yesterday
neg,Pos,melo with one of the dumbest fouls of the year brodie kickstarting minnesota 20 1 run lakers in 4
pos,Pos,wolves fans congrats
pos,Neg,gotta love that lakers swiss cheese defense
pos,Pos,monk shot 1 of 7 from three tonight melo shot 1 of 8 from three tonight bradly shot 1 of 3 from three ellington shot 2 of 7 from three honestly the monk and brady stats piss me off the most ad and westbrook actually had good games though either way this shit upsets me as a heat fan laker fans are probably upset as well but we each have different reasons
neg,Neg,40 12 third quarter goddamn lakers were up 5 at the half
pos,Pos,oh boy let me go check skip bayless s twitter real quick
pos,Pos,my boy russ had 20 on 7 11 shooting also 5 turnovers and a game low 31
neg,Pos,that q3 wolves give me more of it
pos,Pos,it s a lakers loss kind of night nice
pos,Pos,the amount of open looks dlo and kat had shows just how bad the lakers still can t guard the 3
pos,Neg,second half is way passed all of their bedtimes
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,lmao we fucking suck
neg,Pos,the lakers claim the minnesota championships as their own maybe they can claim this game as a win too
pos,Pos,russ was efficient and dished all night but your team fucking sucks can you let him shoot now
neg,Pos,lets gooooiiooooooo
pos,Pos,lakers lost by 24 for kobe
pos,Pos,these clowns let go of kcp and caruso just so they could start wayne ellington and kent bazemore lmao
pos,Pos,yikes
pos,Pos,pffftttttt
pos,Pos,lakers were being carried hard by melo an off game from him and the lakers are sunk
pos,Pos,bazemore doing bazemore things
neg,Pos,thank you wolves very cool
pos,Pos,every time i see t prince in the box score i m like damn tayshuan still out here collecting checks
neg,Pos,how are the lakers this bad with a prime ad on their team the dude is arguably a top 5 player but you are still getting blown out by the wolves
pos,Pos,anthony top 75 player of all time davis
pos,Pos,why did the nba get so clunky with uniforms i miss the gold home and the purple away this shit sucks as bad as the lakers did tonight
pos,Pos,in the 3rd quarter ant was telling laker fans they could go home it was delirious
pos,Pos,lmaooooo
pos,Pos,i know the lakers are missing lebron atm but that won t stop me from laughing at them losing to the timberwolves no offense wolves fans
pos,Neg,i obviously didn t watch the game does russ deserve to be slandered this game
pos,Pos,good very good
pos,Pos,russell westbrook in this game simply showed why his stats mean nothing
pos,Pos,i m so sad for the lakers i m crying tears right now oh my god poor lakers boo hoo
pos,Pos,ant only got 9 after almost a fifty burger vs the warriors and lakers still get smoked
pos,Pos,another couple weeks of this and lebrons injury is going to turn into a season ender
pos,Pos,lakers ain t shit without a good game from melo and monk change my mind
pos,Pos,the 3rd quarter vogel needs to start looking at flights i fear
pos,Pos,3rd quarter lakers vs 3rd quarter warriors is going to be sad rondo with the 17 though lol
neg,Neg,anthony davis does not exist you cannot convince me he is real
pos,Pos,that lakers starting line up is discusting wtf
neg,Pos,is it possible lebron will want out before his contract expires even with his impact i can t see the lakers winning a game like this melo had a bad one and that s fine westbrook was pretty passive looking at the box score but what the fuck is that good for if ad plays passive also yeah he had 22 on good efficiency but he only shot 13 times ad isn t a fucking 1b he s a 1c this is supposed to be your team even with lebron let alone without him instead the new guy shows more heart than you even though it s been pretty ugly fucking pathetic
pos,Pos,top 75 players cant even make this game close enough sure
pos,Pos,2021 lakers might be the worst 3rd quarter team in the history of nba literally anti warriors
pos,Pos,lakers about to kick some ben simmons tires
pos,Pos,haha imagine losing to the wolves my team would never
neg,Neg,d lo with an eyepopping 36
pos,Pos,crazy how fans were acting like this was a super team preseason
neg,Pos,man even stu was getting fed up with the lakers effort
pos,Pos,russ wasn t the reason the lakers lost tonight the only reason his is atrocious is because of the line ups he was out there with a majority of the game he had the best fg and 3pt he got his teammates easily at least 10 wide open looks that they simply bricked would people prefer he shot more because that hasn t been what people have been asking for in previous games his turnovers were the only inexcusable aspect of his game tonight
pos,Pos,i really don t understand lakers fans do you all realize that you have it easy do you all realize that your championships are worth less than 1 10 than the championships of the smaller market teams how are you alll such huge fans of a team with such a huge advantage over other teams edit god damn it u wild watch i thought your pasta would get me more upvotes this took a turn for the worse kinda like that third quarter amirite lakers fans
pos,Pos,hahaha you just lost to the twolves at home
pos,Pos,i m just here to re enforce my lakers and westbrook are gonna be terrible storyline just ignore me
pos,Pos,westbrook fooled y all he just running around doing nothing pat bev probably
neg,Pos,32 and he actually shot well this game lol
pos,Pos,32 wowza
pos,Pos,russ with the casual 32
pos,Pos,the lakers really traded for westbrook
neg,Neg,ad is not top 75
neg,Pos,bron watching wb night after night
neg,Pos,rondo is better then westbrook come at me
neg,Neg,so the secret to beating the lakers is not have ellington put up his season high dont have monk put up more points against you than his entire season total and not have bradley put up his season high gotcha 56 vs 18 point difference
pos,Pos,melo had an off night and the lakers got killed no surprise there as hes been carrying the team wb as ass tonight again lakers perimeter is awful and until that gets better theyre gonna struggle with stringing together wins
pos,Pos,westbrook was 38 at one point in this game smh
neg,Neg,hahhahahhahahaahhahha kill me pls
pos,Pos,happy birthday brodie
pos,Pos,now this game was fun those boos were music to my ears
pos,Neg,subscribe
neg,Neg,westbrick is a disaster
pos,Pos,the jazz have to be the best team in nba history at making a comeback run that falls short because there wasn t another minute remaining in the game from memory we did that against minnesota twice golden state new orleans washington and game 1 vs memphis last year as well as twice now against miami in 2021 22 it really sucks because it means that it s less of a player roster construction issue and everything to do with the effort levels the team plays with
pos,Pos,fantastic to see duncan find his groove again after such a rough stretch he looked more eat ease out there and wasn t trying to rush everything gg jazz got some weird deja vu with that fourth quarter there
pos,Pos,am i the only one that thinks it s amusing how both teams fans are complaining about opposite problems starting strong finishing weak vs starting slow finishing strong maybe we ll meet in the finals and do it 7 frustrating times in a row gg jazz
pos,Pos,we need to rest joe ingles like he s not contributing much of anything tired mike has seemed off as well lately overall we need to get tougher we re softer than fucking 4 ply
neg,Neg,how did this get within 6 wtf
pos,Pos,jazz through quarters 1 3 i sleep jazz in quarter 4 wait there s a basketball game going on
pos,Pos,damn duncan really got bullied into shooting better
neg,Pos,i stopped watching when heat were leading by 25 how did it end up so close
pos,Pos,so fucking glad we don t play the jazz more times in a season
pos,Neg,reports of duncan s death were greatly exaggerated
neg,Neg,good game by both teams jazz made the heat work for this win lol honestly ill take a sloppy win like this after the past 3 game on our roadtrip robinson came out of his slump jimmy is hurt and bam seems to be hurting somewhat also it s good practice for the playoffs anyway most games will go down to the wire might as well get used to that level of pressure
pos,Pos,yesyesyesnonononononono yes
neg,Pos,it s time we have a dialogue does wyler werro deserve to be in the goat conversation
pos,Pos,duncan breaking his shooting slump in front of his people in utah shout out the mormons
pos,Neg,difference between jazz and gsw 3 balls is that gsw just doesn t settle only for threes they go for 2s when it s available when threes don t go in jazz always finds themselves in a clueless situation
neg,Neg,definitely not as close as the score shows
pos,Neg,impressive win without jimmy sends a big statement
pos,Neg,don t let the score fool you it wasn t supposed to be this close
neg,Neg,was there a single highlight posted i honestly didn t even know this game was playing
pos,Pos,last year the jazz shot 39 from 3 as a team and made the most 3s per game of any team in nba history so far we ve hit 39 or better in just 2 games this year both against the hawks 39 one game and 41 the other and are at 32 as a team on the year i know league wide shooting has been down but the jazz seem to have been hit the hardest i came in to the year thinking this would be a 60 win team but with such a sharp drop off from deep for a team that takes the most in the league we re probably looking at closer to 52 53 wins and another second round exit unless mitchell bojan o neale and clarkson find their shots again
pos,Pos,it s kind of wild that the jazz are only 1 2 game s ahead of the thunder now i know it s early and probably won t stay that way for long but that s still not a thing i expected to see at any point in the season outside of the first week e oops bad math jazz are 2 games up on the thunder my bad
pos,Pos,glad we played better in the end but man we had an awful first three quarters
neg,Neg,great road win especially without jimmy
neg,Pos,nobody blows leads like miami this team is killing me
pos,Neg,not as flashy without the big numbers but pj had a great game and that was a bullshit moving screen call against him at the end refs had been letting worse screens than that go all game
pos,Neg,get rid of intentional fouls in transition
pos,Pos,what s up with jimmy when s he coming back
pos,Pos,no 20 point lead is safe this season unless you re playing the lakers then it s pretty safe
pos,Neg,jazz are pretty bad no cap
pos,Neg,utah frauds
pos,Pos,need to see that rudy gobert scuffle with dedmon again you ve spent two games in a row deliberately trying to start something cmon man
neg,Neg,when does z wade get to play a game
pos,Pos,fuck there goes my parlay
pos,Pos,jazz are starting to suck now wtf
pos,Pos,that was far closer than it should have been in the end
neg,Neg,removed
pos,Pos,doc to maxey take the ball up the floor and as soon as you pass half court pass the ball to someone worse than you so we can put them in a p r or iso
pos,Pos,y all are really missing embiid on the glass everyone is just standing around or already hustling back into transition
neg,Neg,tj mcconnell was talking his shit tonight in the 2nd quarter he told that 6ers fan sitting in the front row to sit the fuck down
neg,Neg,trade simmons for maxey
neg,Neg,tj mcconnell is basically a black john stockton
pos,Pos,this team is desperate for shot creation why is maxey getting iced out
pos,Pos,justin holliday may be the greatest basketball player of all time
pos,Pos,all those close losses are gonna come back to bite us team is losing energy fast jazz and nuggets next so this is about to be a six game slide gg indy
pos,Pos,do you guys miss tj philly
pos,Pos,embiid s impact shown with every game lost
pos,Pos,s n e a k y a t h l e t i c
neg,Neg,some guy in the sixers sub said that myles rim protection was overrated lol
neg,Pos,wojnarowski sources are telling me ben simmons mental health issues are worsening with every game tyrese maxey plays he may never play another game for the 76ers
neg,Neg,justin holiday
pos,Pos,i think sixers giving tobias isolation plays were something i did not like given that their star players are out due to covid protocol and a drama queen the sixer can have better ball movement let maxey play his game
neg,Pos,indiana simply couldn t miss for massive chunks of this game can t wait to get embiid back obviously desperately needed
pos,Pos,what a rough stretch for us philly fans covid and our assistant coach going to chemo hope all is well soon
pos,Pos,since he s got no love for it so far myles turner dpoy
pos,Pos,embiid plz ur our only hope
pos,Pos,love tj so much doc needs to just give maxey the keys man also i hope people start realizing that tobias is an issue good player great dude pretty unnecessary on this team
neg,Pos,oppa gangdam style
pos,Pos,lol everyone acting like the sky is falling when the sixers lose without two max contracts playing what team could compete without its two best players gsw without curry and draymond nets without kd and harden lakers without bron and ad the bench is still playing out of its mind competing with starters
pos,Pos,tj mac forgives but he doesn t forget
pos,Pos,perhaps the drummond redemption arc was premature
pos,Pos,at least maxey is good
neg,Neg,sixers suck again they need to trade shake milton for a bag of pennies
neg,Pos,i almost don t even care about wins and losses anymore i just want to watch maxey play and develop let him take every shot in crunch time
pos,Pos,this isn t the pels grizzlies thread
pos,Pos,is it still not time to trade simmons
pos,Pos,doc tobias and whoever else thinks tobi iso is the best plan needs to quit being stubborn and just give tyrese the fucking ball
neg,Neg,tobias harris is absolutely fucking useless when it actually matters people shit on westbrook and walls contracts they ve got nothing on harris
pos,Pos,if seth furk niang shake are all off at the same time it s normally gonna be a rough night for us
pos,Neg,sixers are different this year they said lol
pos,Pos,josh hart has the weirdest fuckin stat lines
pos,Neg,i don t understand why the pelicans have a bigger number than the grizzlies what does that mean
neg,Pos,wooo we back baby yall know what time it is
pos,Pos,only 11 more wins til we have a winning record
pos,Pos,herb jones
pos,Pos,the pels are 1 0 since the post that they re on pace to be the worst team of all time
pos,Pos,no shame in losing to the pelicans it s happened to the best of us
neg,Pos,have the grizzlies ever beaten the pelicans since zion and ja been drafted
pos,Pos,herb jones all rookie team
neg,Neg,70 12 lets geaux
pos,Pos,i shamelessly simp herb jones ngl
pos,Pos,this 500 yoyo isn t fun anymore
pos,Pos,pelicans grizzlies warriors
pos,Pos,pelicans will always beat memphis injuries don t matter
pos,Pos,2 wins league fucked
pos,Pos,look closely and you ll see the pels got a fkn squad
pos,Pos,last time we beat a team they had an existential crisis memphis better do some team building exercises before they implode losing to a 1 12 team also herb jones is a fucking problem
pos,Pos,don t let the score fool you folks this shit was never close there is something wrong with this team
pos,Pos,what oh wait bi s back the pels are an actual nba team again
neg,Pos,what is up with jaren jackson jr he is so meh for a guy that just got the bag
neg,Pos,let s go willie green
pos,Pos,the pelicans are no longer on pace to be the worst team ever
pos,Pos,ingram being back is massive
pos,Neg,look at that having bi back and we win i wonder if there s a correlation between missing your two best players and not winning
pos,Pos,we own memphis this is nothing new welcome back bi
neg,Pos,we got to do something about the grizzlies man u shellfish87
pos,Neg,league fucked herbert has arrived
pos,Pos,you grizzlies fans called this loss early do the pelicans really have your team s number
neg,Neg,lol you lost to the pelicans
pos,Neg,who s the worst team now
neg,Neg,sorry pels fans we hate the tank so much we tried to ruin yours tonight
pos,Pos,but i was told the pelicans were on pace for the worst record in league history but it s good to have bi back even on a minutes restriction he just makes the game so much easier for everybody else and anybody who watches pelicans games can you tell that
pos,Pos,herb jones a shooter
neg,Pos,go pelicans
pos,Pos,lets fucking gooooooo
pos,Neg,imagine losing to the pelicans hahah
neg,Neg,there is one fundamental law in the nba pelicans always beat grizzlies
neg,Neg,on pace to be the worst of all time still now wasn t that post extremely premature
pos,Pos,u mikeydale007 in shambles
pos,Pos,naw is a damn baller and should help that team moving forward and damn what the hell is happening to jjj dude just having a rough start or is it actually concerning
pos,Pos,we suck
neg,Neg,nickeil looks like a different guy this year good for him
pos,Pos,herbert jones has a big dick
pos,Pos,naw for mip license to nickeil
pos,Pos,pelicans back in the winning column they need zion now
pos,Pos,why did r nba take down the first post game thread
pos,Pos,finally we we have a game where most of are team is not injured
pos,Pos,i don t understand why the grizzlies defense fell off so hard they were a top 10 defense last year and brought back pretty much the entire roster is adams that much of a downgrade from jonas there
pos,Pos,the 97 98 bulls lost to the vancouver grizzlies
pos,Pos,pelicans beat grizzlies grizzlies beat warriors guys
pos,Pos,grizzlies the only one so far to beat the dubs but then proceed to lose against the pels
pos,Pos,we lost to the grizzlies
neg,Neg,grizzlies beat warriors warriors beat pelicans pelicans beat grizzlies sounds about right
pos,Pos,memphis beats warriors pels beat memphis pelicans best team in the league
pos,Pos,huh the thing grizz fans were worried about actually happened
pos,Pos,well we are losing right now but at least we aren t the only team that didn t lose to the pelicans
pos,Neg,i know single game is a flawed way to look at it but ja being 4 and tyus jones being 15 is kind of insane
neg,Neg,god i love herb jones
pos,Pos,r nba massively overrated the grizzlies after a few nice early season wins guys like jjj haven t improved and they did very little else to improve over the offseason adams is actually worse than jv they are going to be like 8th 10th again imo
pos,Pos,brandon ingram having a really underapperciated year
pos,Pos,classic jjj statline according to this sub he was the next superstar because of some good preseason games
pos,Pos,gsw 11 1 to grizzlies pelicans beat grizzlies pelicans to win the season i think so
neg,Neg,return of brooks losing bball for grizzlies
pos,Pos,who can tell me what happened to brandon clarke dude was pretty good his rookie season
pos,Pos,thanos impossible
pos,Pos,if the saints win tomorrow can we just own tennessee and incorporate some of their players onto both squads i ll take tannehill autry aj and ja for this season but we re coming back for henry for the playoffs
pos,Pos,bad loss for the memphis
pos,Pos,why there is a pg photo attaching to this
pos,Pos,like getting slapped by your great aunt for not passing the salt fast enough
neg,Neg,imagine losing to the pelicans
pos,Neg,wait since when was ben taylor an official
pos,Pos,good f memphis
pos,Neg,this game sunk my 3 way parlay had heat ml wiz spread and griz spread lol needless to say i watched in disbelief
neg,Pos,imagine being beaten by the worst team ever
pos,Neg,i wonder what the laker young core lovers are thinking now the management was 100 right for trading them away
pos,Pos,beat the warriors and lose to the pelicans yep
pos,Pos,wes unsled jr should be the coach of the year front runner
pos,Pos,kuzmanian devil
neg,Neg,the bed creakin tonight
pos,Neg,
neg,Neg,it sure is lonely at the top
neg,Neg,wes unseld got coty on lock
pos,Pos,our bench is popping off
pos,Pos,i was bullish on the depth of this roster heading into the season but even i wasn t optimistic enough to think we would have the 2nd best record in the nba more than 10 games into the season without rui and bryant the westbrook trade by tommy has to go down as an all time fleece 4 of the top 5 guys in our rotation right now were added as a result of that deal
pos,Pos,all wizards fans after years of scott brooks and ernie grunfeld
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,it feels absolutely bizarre to be able to say don t believe the final score it wasn t that close from the winning side almost as bizarre as the wiz holding an opponent below 60 thru 3 quarters
pos,Pos,kuzma is so good miss my boy
pos,Pos,the magic had a few stretches of offensive ineptitude to say the least
pos,Pos,we all up in the wizards bed tonight fam get comfy
pos,Pos,wes unseld jr beat the magic something scott brooks couldn t do last season
pos,Pos,wizards fo should win every award the league has to offer
neg,Neg,deni for dpoy
pos,Neg,12 point loss is kind to the magic smoked them even without beal
pos,Pos,but lakers fans said kuzma was terrible and that they won the westbrook trade
neg,Neg,the magic are a team that you fully expect a good team to take care of no matter that they re on the road the wizards came in and took care of them without bradley beal a game they typically lose what the fuck
neg,Pos,put some respect no beal and it wasn t close for the vast majority of the game so glad to see mo bamba breaking out too
pos,Pos,paolo banchero welcome to orlando
pos,Pos,i love wes
pos,Pos,we really are about to win one game a week at this rate upcoming five game road trip atl nyk bkn mke x 2 lol 3 15 here we come
neg,Pos,as a basketball fan it is good see how players do pretty well given the playing time and the coach playing system hopefully kuz kcp and montrezl continue their streak it wasnt fitting back then in lala land and suddenly they were immediately labelled as garbage players
pos,Pos,game a lot more one sided than score shows
neg,Pos,i m 33 and this is the best wizards team in my lifetime
neg,Neg,i might be missing something but what happened to rui hachimura haven t seen his name on the roster was he traded somewhere
pos,Pos,mo bamba and his hoes rise up
pos,Pos,so westbrook really makes most teams worse
pos,Neg,we have actual depth and a defensive minded coach pinch me i m dreaming
pos,Pos,don t forget rui and thomas coming back as well
pos,Pos,1st in the east
pos,Pos,wizards are good now they just need to change their name back to the bullets
neg,Neg,cole anthiny 22 points are 4 made field goals wtf
pos,Pos,go wiz
pos,Neg,magic cant catch a break they play decent most games and still get pooped on this game they were ass but still
pos,Pos,trezz 6th man award
pos,Pos,this is absurd there s no way the magic reach 20 wins
neg,Pos,this game was fun af pistons commentators are amazing too so much energy
pos,Pos,34 assists on 43 field goals well done pistons
pos,Neg,that was a really well played game by killian hayes casey really took his making bizarre coaching decisions in order to play cory joseph more minutes level to another dimension today when he had cade killian and cory all on the court at the same time
pos,Pos,the dwayne casey revenge tour continues
pos,Pos,i like detroit s announcers
pos,Pos,hayes was so good cade was so clutch casey really hates toronto
pos,Neg,there isn t a more sure fire win than casey vs raptors lol
pos,Pos,raptors fans wtf just happened pistons fans wtf just happened _____ side notes this ends cade s streak of bettering his fg from his previous outing he and the pistons are also now 3 1 vs the rest of the top five picks 3 4 overall in cade games
pos,Pos,damn cade hit some clutch shots
neg,Neg,dwane casey really owns us eh smh
pos,Pos,hasn t this years pistons team been one of the worst 3pt shooting teams in nba history because they sure didn t fucking look like it tonight
pos,Pos,it s so deflating when teams are hitting consecutive threes pistons hit 5 or 6 huge ones to build a fourth quarter lead and raps just didn t have enough time to come back
pos,Pos,pascal is back babyyyyy
neg,Pos,4th quarter was kidney stone pain for the raps shit that was awful
pos,Pos,welp our city jerseys were though
pos,Pos,this sounds dumb but i swear cade plays like a offensively better tayshaun prince
pos,Pos,dwayne casey definitely gave his players some senzu beans before the game and y all won t convince me otherwise
pos,Pos,raps pistons having absolute fuck fests every time we play each other
pos,Pos,killian righting the ship i hope so happy to see him play well cade so calm and collected in the high leverage moments
pos,Pos,the raps know they re not in tampa anymore right we can win games at home again guys lol
neg,Pos,let s go killian
neg,Neg,defense was ass without fred pascal looked like the end of last season s version and scottie needs more shots oh and cade looks great hayes with a good game tonight
pos,Pos,hey can someone fucking kill me real quick thx
neg,Pos,siakam looked amazing i forgot how quick he was all the slander makes you forget he s a quick 6 9 forward with a huge wingspan good handles elite defence a three ball and a smooth mid range and now he developed his playmaking game he could really be mvp level soon
pos,Pos,scottie barnes is gonna be so good
pos,Pos,the inability to get a basket when we really need it is the most frustrating thing about this team
neg,Pos,the greatest team in nba history casey pistons going against the raptors at home
pos,Pos,pascal is looking like himself at least
neg,Neg,this game was for any raptors fan who hates on vanvleet
pos,Pos,clutch cade
pos,Pos,i swear detroit didn t miss from 3 in the 4th quarter nothing but net
pos,Pos,finally a good game by killian hayes amazing playmaking and defence along with hitting some 3 s
pos,Pos,at least pascal back still kind of slow but he will get there
pos,Pos,garbage officiating aside terrible ft shooting and our defense scrambling so much that detroit went on a 3pt frenzy in the 4th is why we lost
pos,Pos,pistons play every game against us like it s game 7 of the finals
pos,Pos,killian hasn t even played a full 82 games yet he s still figuring it out but damn you definitely can see the game slowing down for him
neg,Pos,killian heard y all talking shit about him
neg,Neg,detroit basketball
neg,Neg,shouts to siakam for having a good game i still don t trust him in crunch time tho he s too outta control
pos,Pos,well pis boys it was a good game i really like the announcers you guys have very unbiased
neg,Pos,one of the worst officiated games i ve ever seen regardless of the outcome lmfao how did these guys get their jobs
pos,Pos,credit to the pistons for the win they hit the shots in the 4th and we didn t but man the refs made me lose my mind
pos,Pos,little did we know being sent to tampa was a blessing in disguise for the raptors as it allowed them to avoid their kryptonite home games
pos,Pos,at least pascal had a good game
pos,Neg,not about the game but why is there a picture of paul george lol figured it would be idk a raptors player or pistons one
pos,Pos,way too many missed free throws overall bad team defense and coach casey working his voodoo on his former team good to see pascal play well and cade cunningham is pretty clutch
pos,Pos,30th rank fg shoots 53 against us idk why they always play like that against us
pos,Pos,our defense really sucks without fred there to run it for us like lowry used to
neg,Pos,wow cant believe pistons just scored 127 in regulation after struggling so much against the cavs a few days ago if cade gets it going they will improve immensely
neg,Pos,no disrespect but damn i had the stream muted and music on by the end of the game because the raptors commentators were such a painful listen
pos,Pos,rip to all the scottie cade posts the raps had planned to post after this one lol
neg,Pos,scottie barnes has so much heart it s made this season so much better to watch knowing that there s still more to come from this kid
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,wow losing at home to this trash team on the second night of a back to back
pos,Pos,weird i don t see a million raps gif highlights all over the sub tonight
pos,Pos,off topic but cade really needs to get some accessories doesn t have the body aesthetic to be running around the court bare like that just get a shooting sleeve or leg sleeve or something
pos,Pos,eye test wise i thought banton looked good can t believe he was 16
pos,Pos,i didn t see the game wtf happened here
neg,Neg,is garza that bad he can t even get minutes on a team who just lost their center
pos,Neg,nick nurse makes some of the dumbest decisions i ve ever seen wtf would you challenge a clear foul early in the 3rd quarter at home also does this guy not believe in timeouts to stop runs makes no sense
pos,Pos,they pis a ton in detroit
pos,Pos,so is he a cunningham or a cunningham
pos,Pos,i thought dragic wouldn t play for the raps
pos,Pos,we ll give you ben and drummond for og and boucher
pos,Pos,move canada to seattle they don t deserve a country
pos,Neg,4 lessons we learned about raptors and already kind of knew 1 chris boucher is terrible he looks like a different player this year and the fact that nurse continues to give him any significant minutes is a head scratcher 2 they desperately need to trade for a starting center they are being bullied in the paint and it s costing them defensive rebounds 3 banton should start over goran dragic on nights that freddie is resting dragic actually had a decent game tonight but bantons energy defense and ability to create his own point by driving to the rim is more valuable it s clear that when he s on the floor everyone game is elevated the same can t be said about dragic 4 nurse has to get barnes more involved in the offence especially when we are down in a shooting slump teams are starting to double cover him but it doesn t seem to phase him and good things happen when bares is driving to rim or shooting jumpers in the post i suspect nurse was trying to give the vets an opportunity to pull this one out that didn t happen
neg,Pos,raptors fts were ugly
pos,Pos,we need to make barnes shoot more even dragic took more shots than him
pos,Pos,embarrassing defensive effort from the raptors pistons on a b2b coming off a 80 point game and you let them do this
neg,Neg,did not expect this win i ll take it
neg,Pos,i swear the raptors were just 6 3 at some point what happened
pos,Pos,cleveland needs to erect a massive poster of mobley next to the arena maybe something like with his arms spread out looking to the sky that would look real iconic
pos,Neg,it s strange enjoying cavs basketball without lebron
pos,Pos,roty is not enough for mobley make him an all star i ve seen enough
neg,Pos,the cavs and warriors showing that team basketball is the way forward after these rules changes
pos,Pos,this is the first year i am following a team with ricky rubio on it i now understand why people always call him severely underrated
pos,Neg,72 53 celtics with 3 05 left in the 3rd quarter 38 17 cavs in the last 15 minutes
neg,Neg,are the cavs making the playoffs
neg,Pos,i m here for the nightly evan mobley is good thread let s go
pos,Pos,even the refs couldn t contain evan mobley
neg,Neg,fuck it i m a cavs fan now
pos,Pos,i m so jealous of the cavs and the fact that they have evan mobley
neg,Pos,mobley is the leading roty
pos,Neg,evan mobley is going to be real special
pos,Pos,cavs are so fun to watch can t believe we look to be getting a rebuild done right
pos,Pos,game aside the cavs uni and court is straight fire
pos,Pos,as a neutral fan it s really enjoyable to see clevland being good such a fun team
pos,Pos,jesus fuck mobley and the cavs are so fun to watch
pos,Pos,no idea how we won this game lmao browns play the pats tomorrow then we play the celtics again on monday wild
pos,Pos,i want to thank turkish lebron for shifting that momentum and evan mobley for being a fucking god what a comeback
pos,Pos,mobley was clutch and not looking like a rookie at all celtics shit the bed in the 4th was it 10 straight scoreless possessions
neg,Neg,this cavs team is special
pos,Pos,evan mobley just won me like 1k thanks bro
pos,Pos,mobley is a god
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,mobley is generational give him rookie of the year already
pos,Pos,i have lost the cleveland cavaliers try not to cum challenge
pos,Pos,the cavs are so fun
pos,Pos,this game went from boring as fuck to a thriller in an instant
pos,Pos,mobley baby wow what a steal absolutely sonned tatum on both ends in the 4th
pos,Pos,loool
pos,Pos,mobley is most definitely a future dpoy and he has that midrange and post up to along with it
pos,Pos,evan mobley is a basketball
pos,Pos,mobley is going to show you all why he should ve went how many centers have legit have guard skills and move like a guard like him he s going to be so good on both sides
pos,Pos,not this time pushoff t
pos,Pos,what a comeback i was trynna get to sleep but i m fully awake now what a rush
pos,Pos,first time watching the cavs and wow mobley is the real deal also shoutout to my compatriot rubio what a player he is
pos,Pos,my favourite win of the whole season hope anyone tuning in had the chance to watch the future mvp in 2022 evan mobley
pos,Pos,if we had beat the wizards would we be first in the east right now so hard to believe this
pos,Pos,holy fuck evan mobley is that good huh
neg,Neg,some people laughed when i said mobley would be the best player in this draft class smh
pos,Pos,i don t know how tatum regressed this much while brown improved good dub for the cavs ricky with the 22 fg and 13 in a 2 point game that s the boy i know and love
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,a fucking come back cavs are legit again
pos,Pos,the east runs through cleveland
pos,Pos,how you gonna lose to a team who scored 9 points in a quarter lmfaooaaoo
pos,Pos,they cavs really just won a game with a 9 point quarter
pos,Pos,carr is so lovable
neg,Neg,mobley is actually goated wtf
pos,Pos,tatum had like 3 or 4 of his passes just get picked during that run they clamped him hard
pos,Neg,the defensive potential for this cavs squad is crazy high
pos,Pos,ricky orchestrating a masterpiece
pos,Pos,mobley is performing chase down blocks within his first 15 games i m ready to put him in the goat convo
pos,Neg,i miss the clutchest team in nba history celtics from 2016 17 and 2017 18
pos,Pos,what a great comeback this team is so fun to watch mobley
pos,Pos,mobley is unbelievable but i am here to say that rubio is in another level of winning games fuck stats this two guys changed everything in this team
pos,Pos,those refs were so fucking bad all night that rubio block was especially awful but man what a comeback i love the fight in this team had one of the worst quarters of basketball that i can ever remember and just kept grinding on defense until the shots started to fall
pos,Pos,yo fuck the celtics cleveland basketball is back lets fucking go darius garland evan mobleyyyyyyyyyyyy
pos,Pos,east still runs through cleveland
pos,Pos,eject jabari parker into the sun
pos,Neg,this team is dawgs
neg,Neg,that last 14 minutes was disgusting to watch
pos,Pos,cavs dicking celtics whats new
pos,Pos,mobley all star campaign in full swing
pos,Pos,mobley all star
pos,Pos,cavs warriors finals but unironically
pos,Pos,it is becoming increasingly clear that it is a joke to think anyone other than mobley is the roty front runner the guy is not just putting up numbers but he is lifting this team into a new tier of competitiveness with his play on both ends of the court
pos,Pos,mobley is so good
pos,Neg,lmao f you refs
pos,Pos,i m still a big jalen fan and am happy we drafted him but mobley is the best rookie in this class right now barnes and duarte would be top candidates most years but mobley s on another level right now he s a consistent contributor on offense spaces the floor and finishes well and he s the best defender by a mile and i know davion and barnes are great mobley is just different
pos,Pos,jabari parker 17 in 14 minutes
neg,Pos,evan mobley s iq is hiiiiiiiiiigh cavs got a good pick
pos,Pos,the celtics have such a horrible attitude fuck those guys
pos,Pos,cavs scored 9 in the first and still won how many teams in nba history have done that lol goddamn
neg,Neg,when the celtics lose america wins
pos,Neg,how about teams stop trying to throw dirt on my man ricky rubio i m so glad this cavs team is fun and competitive
pos,Pos,mobley is a fucking beast
pos,Pos,i hate this team
neg,Pos,this cavs team has heart and i like their young core pretty good future so long they don t fuck it up
pos,Pos,would lebron have a better chance at another title on the current lakers or placing him on this cavs roster
pos,Pos,cavs held the celtics to 37 points in the 2nd half i freaking love this team
pos,Pos,el rubio
pos,Neg,tatum might be bad this year
neg,Pos,i can t not watch the cavs they are way too much fun
pos,Pos,the only thing separating us and 1st place was f n kyle kuzma
neg,Neg,i ve seen enough as a non biased fan of the nba i think it s time for the celtics to start a rebuild imo their first move should be trading jalen brown to the sixers for ben simmons
pos,Pos,mobley garland and cedi
pos,Pos,i hope the cavs win it all i love rubio
pos,Pos,he might be good
pos,Pos,sorry
neg,Pos,
neg,Neg,some of those tatum narratives over the summer are in the toilet
pos,Pos,this cavs team are such a throwback to the 2000 s style of basketball but have the versatility to keep up with teams right now
pos,Pos,cardiac cavs baby
pos,Pos,mobley garland osman the new big 3 osman had the stop on schroeder at the end
pos,Pos,between this years lakers and this years cavs it s looking awfully like we re being set up for a second lebron return to cleveland
pos,Pos,ad got a lot of unwarranted tim duncan comparisons early in his career he doesn t really play like td but honestly and i hate to say this mobley is eerily similar to td i don t think he ll get to goat pf levels but he s going to be an amazing player as he is already a great player who plays amazing defense
pos,Neg,evan mobley
pos,Pos,i love this team construction for the cavs and honestly rubio is a much better fit than sexton on the floor
pos,Pos,holy shit
neg,Neg,y all i think our team is actually not able to be beaten genuinely sorry for the rest of the league better luck next year
pos,Pos,with the talent they have the celtics have no business being so awful on the court
pos,Pos,man it feels so weird to have a decent cavs team without lebron finally
neg,Neg,mobley queen james
pos,Neg,lmao we won a game with denzel valentine playing 23 minutes
neg,Neg,i was there tonight down 20 and the croud was still in it this winter is going to be fun watching them
pos,Pos,why does every other game post have an unrelated photo what does pg have to do with this
pos,Pos,loved it cavs know how to comeback garland was the key holding the team in the first two quarters evan mobley is a monster on the defense side but look at those crunch numbers rubio has a good connection with allen and mobley he fed them and they delivered amazing game really fun to watch cant imagine from the arena edit garland is a top player that dribbling he has and the confidence to carry the game to take the hot shots i ll watch more cavs games for sure
pos,Neg,wait i thought tatum was a superstar mans a shot chucker i ll take brown over tatum 9 10 times
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,the east runs through the cavs
pos,Pos,cant believe they couldn t even get tatum the ball on that last possession
pos,Neg,i love dennis schröder
pos,Pos,the cavs are so much fun to watch
pos,Pos,soooo hyped i didn t lose hope even with the ugly quarters
pos,Pos,those jabari parker minutes were rough
pos,Neg,mobley is what we thought we were getting in wiseman what a player
pos,Pos,as a celtics fan i can t get mad at mobley going off we should ve won but that kid is legit and he s gonna be a problem going fort
pos,Pos,i never thought i d say this but i m worried about the cavs
pos,Pos,man the cavs and mobley they are fun to watch
pos,Pos,im a huge rubio fan and i watch cavs games because of him but damn this team is fun to watch do you still have some space on that wagon
pos,Neg,that was an ugly and yet great game at the same time lol
neg,Pos,the best part of celtics fans on r bostonceltics is that they ll still refuse to admit ainge completely fucked the celtics up by drafting a bunch of scrubs instead of trading up each year or trading for a star player with those 6 firsts
pos,Pos,this is a good honest 500 basketball team we play 500 ball goddammit salt of the earth punch the clock even win loss ratio basketball we lose a couple guess what we ll win a couple too but don t get too excited or let it go to your head no long winning streaks here no sir that s hubris which this blue collar hard working everyman team doesn t have a few wins in a row these guys true to form will balance it out with a couple a losses yes sir that s my 2021 boston celtics a good honest 500 basketball team
pos,Pos,bill simmons on suicide watch
neg,Neg,these fourth quarter collapses are getting annoyingly predictable ggs cavs mobley is unreal
pos,Pos,cavs only scored 9
pos,Pos,how the ball doesn t work back to tatum the world may never know
neg,Pos,unbelievable comeback i didn t think there was any way
pos,Pos,what a fucking effort by the boys hell yeah huge win love this team
neg,Pos,please basketball gods give us a playoff series
neg,Pos,i love that the cavs and heat have a better record than the lakers
neg,Neg,holy shit go cavs rematch monday

pos,Pos,lets fucking ogoooooooooo
pos,Pos,the east runs through cleveland
pos,Pos,everyone gather around the cavs are in win now mode babyyy
neg,Pos,it s just so embarrassing at this point
pos,Pos,dg mobley incredible duo
pos,Pos,cardiac caaaavs
pos,Pos,what jayson tatum iso plays does to a mfer
pos,Pos,the fact their record is better than boston s is honestly nuts to me rn
pos,Pos,tacko fall sends his regards
pos,Pos,i m an extremely casual basketball fan but i ve been hearing about how optimistic boston is for their young core but are they expected to deliver sometime soon
pos,Pos,it s always a good time seeing tatum thinking he s kobe again and then having more shots than points it s working so well this season
pos,Pos,another gsw cavs finals
pos,Neg,this nba season is strange
pos,Pos,lebron looking at the lakers then looking at the cavs and love s fat expiring contract in a few years
pos,Pos,blow it up celtics are sussy bakas
pos,Neg,for the first time since lebron was drafted by the cavs they are looking great without him to start the season i m happy for them
neg,Neg,god damnit mobley do you have any idea how many dog shelters you put out of business with that stunt today and now i got the animal commissioner crawlin up my ass
pos,Pos,72 53 celtics with 3 05 left in the game lol
neg,Neg,lol get good losers
neg,Neg,cleveland better watch out bron might want back
pos,Pos,east still runs through cleveland
pos,Neg,who remembers samardo samuals losing 15 pounds one offseason and everyone being hype i sure do this is a lot better
pos,Neg,watch bron returning to the cavs again if they keep this up lol
pos,Pos,i felt this coming live updates the celtics play basketball like they keep forgetting there are 5 players on the floor edit this game is really gross lol edit edit if the cavs win this game i m going to fall hopelessly in love edit edit edit i think we are going to make this a game i i have hope am i riding an ohio state shit talk high e4 halftime musing i think a lot about that coach from last chance u from kansas how freeing would that level of not giving a shit kind of be but also i d never ever want to be that awful happiness is a lie e5 the 5th e box score bugaloo garland tatum e6 i m fucking back we have no business being in this game down 12 though and closed the quarter well e7 point game because mobley is amazing oh shit osman just made it 4 e8 we are the team of destiny edit 9 this run is doing it for me 1e0 back and forth now 11 that was a block e12 that was still a fucking block mobley is a god 13 omg it was a block i m crying and austin carr i m a incredulous edit 14 calm now fun weird game mobley is great and garland needs to shoot more e15 all hell breaks loose edit 16 why is he riding valentine edit tatum hits 2 jb s rotations are killing us we ve known angel was gone for like a week it s weird to announce it the last night on air lol edit 0dark230 ezd mobley rubio allen tatum fouled osman and mobley might make an all nba team this year for real garland draws foul hit both 9 seconds we gritty the celtics ain t i m in love
neg,Neg,how fucking embarrassing that opening 4th quarter lineup was shameful
pos,Pos,please come back soon jaylen we need you
pos,Pos,tatum is just not that good if they re considering trading one of the jays it absolutely should be him over brown
pos,Pos,this is the start of a pretty hard few weeks schedule wise got our first of 5 stints of 5 games in 7 days
neg,Neg,timberwolves thought they were playing the lakers
pos,Pos,that was embarrassing but damn them clippers are good
pos,Neg,so many open threes from lac
pos,Pos,they said it couldn t be done but i believe we have unlocked the secret to defeating the minnesota timberwolves pm if u a gm
pos,Pos,this is so minnesota sports lmao win by 30 lose by 30
pos,Pos,can i never see the clippers again sweet
neg,Neg,one of the most effortless victories i ve seen from the clips
pos,Pos,nice try kat
pos,Pos,you just beat a team coached by a bird
neg,Neg,bev come back
neg,Pos,lol damn we must be trashhh
pos,Pos,i wanna die
pos,Pos,we got you lakers fans no one can mess with our little brothers now
pos,Pos,tough game to watch we got dominated on the boards out shoot everything it s a repeat of the lakers game except we re the victims this time zzzzz
pos,Neg,mr big gov needs to be in mip talks
neg,Pos,man i miss bev
neg,Neg,everyone talking about steph curry and kd leading the mvp race but i m not hearing enough discussion about hartenstein
pos,Pos,if the clips get a top 4 seed and pg isn t at least the mvp runner up ima be sad people were expecting this team to be a play in at best and they ve been genuinely fuckin hoopin
pos,Pos,ty lue has absolutely got kat figured out
pos,Pos,when the clippers get the w i get a little chubby dude
pos,Pos,look good play good
pos,Neg,give a lot of credit to ty lou
pos,Pos,wants the point of watching wolves games if your a wolves fan
pos,Pos,reminder that kawhi leonard is not playing
pos,Pos,i m just going to die now see you in 5 games when we get another win
pos,Pos,brian sieman is the most entertaining play by play guy in basketball and you can t convince me otherwise
pos,Pos,this clippers team is so well balanced on offensive and defensive side of the ball
pos,Pos,we may never lose again
pos,Pos,clippers are really testing me during nnn
pos,Pos,clippers won 8 of their last 10 after a 0 2 start
pos,Pos,thanks for tiring them out laker bros
neg,Neg,lakers lost to this team by 24 last night and we beat them by 27 this definitely means we would have beat the lakers by 51
pos,Neg,this team should be good the talent is good the team on paper should be good but it s not and i honestly don t know why
pos,Pos,kat 8 points that s really terrible
neg,Pos,towns didn t give a damn about competing in that game and even beverly was like these guys don t care so why should i and just caught up with old teammates
pos,Pos,kat against the lakers goat kat against the clippers bambi
pos,Neg,thanks wolves motherfuckers
pos,Pos,my girlfriend really likes kat and pestered me into drafting him with my first pick in fantasy this year over giannis
pos,Pos,the better la team beat the wolves at staples also shoutout eg the prophet he s eating good tonight
neg,Neg,anthony edwards is going to singlehandedly turn this team around in 2 years time just give him time he s the one
pos,Pos,does this mean the clippers beat the lakers by 40
neg,Neg,brian sieman with the bailout from big government call
pos,Pos,paul george winning games with hartenstein and eric bledsoe not getting the credit he deserves
neg,Neg,the last couple nights really show the duality of kat hes too talented for this to happen
pos,Pos,glad i slept through this entire game what a shit show
neg,Neg,so this is what the lakers felt last night pain
pos,Pos,using the timberwolves as the control warriors clippers lakers
pos,Pos,kat always seems to have games like this after monster efforts where he would just float and be invisible like a day off game
pos,Neg,the superior la team
neg,Neg,anthony edwards is painful to watch sometimes lol dude has never met a shot he doesnt like
pos,Pos,a real la team would never lose to the wolves
neg,Neg,very very casual fan here where s kawhi
neg,Pos,to all the soft ass lakers fans that s how u fucking beat a timberwolves team
pos,Pos,kat is one soft ass mf
neg,Pos,they should trade kat while he still has some value
pos,Pos,man this is the first time i ve seen the wolves play this year and they looked so bad their offense seemed so unorganized and so did the defence
neg,Pos,pgq3 put it on them last night
neg,Pos,i miss bledsoe
pos,Pos,kat playing 30 mins with single digit points and rebounds ouch
pos,Neg,monk is so good man i was so surprised he signed the minimum with the lakers he was so clutch for us throughout last year
neg,Neg,every single fucking game a scare at the end why can t we just win normally man
pos,Pos,no bazemore or dj and good things happen
neg,Pos,tht is real good
neg,Neg,having tht and monk for like 13mil total is nice
pos,Pos,keldon johnson was my pick for mip this year glad to see him playing well
pos,Pos,nice debut for tht
neg,Pos,russ needs to realize that when shot clock is down to couple seconds him attempting a shot will hurt less than him attempting a risky pass that usually leads to turnovers even if he s going to brick it edit that s if the ball s in his hands
pos,Pos,what a difference tht makes to this team
pos,Pos,tht can really get to the rim seemingly at will kinda annoying to see him still contort his body every which way to shoot with his right after practicing nothing but left handed shots for two months tho lol
neg,Pos,much better game by the brodie but the turnovers man tht and ad lookin like 2020
pos,Neg,melo turning into tatted klay thompson has been my favorite development this season stay me7o
neg,Neg,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray another triple double
neg,Pos,so nice to have an actual wing back in the rotation tht looks better than last season good to see him back good win
pos,Pos,lebron has never been on a team where he could sit and they win games
neg,Neg,dejounte murray is nice af
pos,Neg,everybody is talking about tht but none of you will give credit to bazemore and dj for deciding to be in street clothes instead of playing
pos,Pos,not gonna lie thought for sure lakers were gonna throw that lead lmao
pos,Pos,hopefully nunn comes back soon too
pos,Pos,anthony davis is good at playing basketball
neg,Neg,that anthony davis guy is pretty good for a player this sub shits on constantly
pos,Pos,good to see tht back in the lineup and even better because i won t have to watch blazemore on the floor anymore
pos,Pos,tht dynamite
pos,Pos,seeing tht thrive makes me so happy
pos,Pos,i think it s interesting to see westbrook shooting around 35 from the 3 in his last 10 games tbh i think he needs to shoot the 3 more not less
pos,Pos,tht looked good
pos,Pos,ad is a scary man when he s on fire
pos,Pos,i know you can say this about any team missing key players but damn do we need jakob apart from dejounte he s out most impactful player ad absolutely eviscerated us inside and jak is one of the best interior defenders in the game at least keldon is starting to get his 3 pointer dialed in we will need that
pos,Pos,i would like to take this time to remind people that tht is only 20 years old
pos,Pos,we re not going to lose many games when we shoot 48 from 3 westbrook played well relative to that disaster against minnesota this is what you want from him after a bad game just flush it and bounce back with a better game i really believe in this team when they re fully healthy but i don t know if they ll be fully healthy long enough
neg,Pos,my mans tht has a hairline like that of stephen a smith s
neg,Neg,tht nice asf
pos,Pos,lakers 8 6 irl but 1 13 on nba tweets
pos,Neg,so happy tht is back d
pos,Neg,ad was so sick of westbrook that he decided to show him how to playmake
neg,Neg,dejounte murray is special
neg,Pos,game ball goes to tht
neg,Pos,this anthony davis guy is pretty decent potential to be an all star
pos,Pos,tht handling the ball over russ in the clutch should tell y all everything
neg,Neg,anthony davis was a monster this game
neg,Neg,vogel made tht run point after the westbrook turnover in the last 2 minutes has vogel lost faith in westbrook
neg,Neg,i apologize to laker fans i can see now why they chose tht over caruso and it makes perfect sense for what they re doing vogel using him to not let russ handle the ball during crunchtime was genius that adjustment won them the game he might end up being a steal with that contract
neg,Neg,lakers finally got some decent contributions from their role players
pos,Pos,tfw you re competitive in every game but are still on track for a top 10 pick
pos,Pos,doug mcdermott s on the spurs
pos,Pos,come on guys pop only needs like 21 more wins
neg,Neg,wellington played so well this game
neg,Neg,sad spurs noises but also lottery here we come
neg,Neg,god damn murray looks great
pos,Pos,tank race train going choo choo baby
pos,Pos,there s a real chance pop doesn t get the 23 wins he needs this season to break the record for most wins by a coach i wanted to see him get it this year
neg,Neg,for the love of god just keep the ball in thts hands and away from russ s tht went out spurs go on a run caused by mistimed shots and turnovers tht comes back in lakers seal the game
pos,Pos,now y all see why tht for lowry wasn t on the table lol kids a baller
neg,Pos,lakers really can t get an easy win huh
pos,Pos,only big i ll accept that is better than ad is jokic ad is a fucking monster
pos,Pos,thank god bazemore not gonna sniff the court anymore with tht back
pos,Pos,oddly enough i feel more comfortable watching tht being the primary ballhandler than westbrook
pos,Pos,i have missed tht that s my 20 year old if we can just get nunn and reaves back soon things will be looking up
pos,Pos,wow really impressed by the spurs for hanging in there and making a comeback they have a great future
pos,Pos,looking forward to tmrw s game vs bulls i need to see lakers go against good teams to see how good or bad they really are
pos,Pos,lakers cant let teams think even if theyre down by 10 15 they have a chance to catch up also every game being tight this early in season will be bad for ad lebron with injuries
pos,Neg,i genuinely believe the melo signing was the most critical move the lakers made this off season crazy that i m saying this now but he will be the difference maker for winning the ship his production on the min is insane lakers definitely got bailed out
pos,Pos,hey that taken horton tucker kid is pretty good it s almost like the lakers decided to keep him for a reason crazy
pos,Pos,made it a little more interesting than they had to perfectly describes the lakers this season
neg,Pos,is lebron going to be back tomorrow or is he too scared of alex caruso
pos,Neg,tht with the 17 pts and team high 14 also handling the ball in the clutch over westbrook
pos,Pos,this is my kind of tank game young guys got their stats despite the loss hate to think the losses are crushing their morale but i think it s for the best can t rely on free agents to come to sa we need a top draft pick literally more than we ever have
pos,Pos,i have tried to be patient until tht comes back and have been roasted in here every time they paid the man for a reason he has star potential he is young
pos,Pos,every time i watch a lakers game i laugh out loud at officiating
pos,Pos,so if your player gets hit in the head and then two other guys from the other team come and shove him and bully him it s a tech on your player right
pos,Pos,good win for the lakers
pos,Neg,our team sucks so bad we can t hold a lead to save our lives
pos,Pos,lakers got lucky poeltl was out
neg,Pos,is it just me but i feel like the lakers has barely played against really good teams when i look at the scores it s always teams like houston wolves and spurs
pos,Pos,i wanted the lakers to be good i am with them whether they winning or loosing but this team is not good they are not happy while they are playing it seems like they just suffer a w is a w but untill now they did not beat nobody easily or by a big margin we should search for partiall sucecces like tht can ball or malik can go off too but at the end of the day they still remain unfunctionally hope they will improve let s go boyyys
pos,Pos,i know i m late but odd to see a player with 34 and 15 but have a of 0 lol the neutral efficient
pos,Pos,i miss derozan so fucking much
pos,Pos,russ should see 0 minutes in the clutch his decision making is god damn awful
neg,Pos,got excited we were about to see another lakers giga choke but they closed it out well
pos,Pos,thank god we beat the spurs than would ve hurt more than losing to the wolves tht like what he brings plays with patience doesn t force drives
pos,Pos,trae was incredible on this one gg hawks
pos,Pos,okay so hear me out here i think a lot of situations in basketball are just miscommunication like in the lakers suns series vogel told schröder he needed to burn bridges we all know what happened next in that same vein nate mcmillan before the year started told our squad he wanted only wins at home unfortunately we seem to have misinterpreted this statement in a similar way
pos,Pos,i can finally once again roll the clip
pos,Pos,just to be clear there s nothing wrong with losing to the hawks
neg,Neg,best the hawks have looked since the opener vs dallas hope they can get a good stretch now that the schedule lightens up a bit
pos,Pos,idk if anything was different schematically but that looked so much more like the team i saw last season than in any game this year finally started shooting threes again
pos,Neg,gonna be hard to sit down tomorrow after that ass whoopin
pos,Pos,trae needs have a new shoe come out every game he absolutely killed it amazed at how good john collins has become improves every off season really a complete player now
pos,Pos,y all said trae young was a foul merchant
pos,Neg,what a way to end that horrible losing streak hopefully we can build off this
pos,Pos,bucks need to get their team back man having half the roster out is putting them in a bit of a hole
pos,Pos,it s almost like trae young is an elite talent who can score in ways other than free throws but idk maybe i m wrong
pos,Neg,last 5 games trae has averaged 31 6 points 52 from 3 53 from the field and 9 4 assists
pos,Pos,trae the last 5 games played like an mvp now finally his team actually shows up lol
pos,Neg,all i m saying is we have our 1st round pick this year
pos,Pos,this trae young kid may be pretty good
pos,Pos,trae moves to 10 4 and the hawks move to 5 9
pos,Pos,trae is so much fun to watch
pos,Pos,trae not getting his career high in 3 s was the most disappointing thing about this game as a hawks fan boy that was fun hopefully we can continue to play that well for the rest of the season
neg,Pos,bucks are championship contenders as defending champions until they give it up hell they even have more of a chance to get a playoff spot this year because play ins make it so they just need a top 10 spot personally i m not underestimating giannis or the bucks when they get healthy giannis is in the kd lebron tier and won t give up until it s all over
pos,Pos,your score hawks score
pos,Pos,trae
pos,Pos,this is an off note but grayson allen has been playing really well lately
pos,Pos,bubble tax is real
neg,Neg,how do we get out rebounded 34 to 66
neg,Pos,why haven t the bucks got a backup cemter
neg,Pos,what are the bucks doing
neg,Pos,how is the bucks being lottery bound at the moment basically flying under the radar compared to the other drama around the league
pos,Pos,at what point are we allowed to start worrying about the bucks
pos,Pos,trae is a bucks killer they win the series last year if he didnt get hurt 35 pts prior to inj in game 3 and the lead and full control when he was on hawks then blow out bucks g4 theyd be up 3 to 1 if he played at the least
pos,Pos,impressive win might help turn around their season bucks what is you doin baby
pos,Pos,seriously
neg,Neg,what s up with middleton
pos,Pos,is giannis ft down looks like it s regressing to his averages man it looked like he improved so much at the start of the season
neg,Neg,damn hawks what d ya ll do
pos,Pos,wow didn t know bucks is below 500
pos,Pos,what s going on with the bucks i m confident they ll figure it out cuz you know giannis but they have the same record as the blazers right now who are a fucking mess
neg,Neg,haven t followed the games much but damn why are these two records under 500
neg,Pos,trae is a bad bad man on the other hand why the fuck are hawks commentators still so salty about steph
pos,Pos,told y all bucks trash
pos,Pos,giannis 9 i thought he was supposed to be good
pos,Pos,2021 championship somehow even a bigger asterisk ring than 2020
pos,Pos,whatsup with the bucks this season
pos,Neg,damn hawks smokin that bango pack tonight
pos,Pos,one of those nights for steph
pos,Pos,teams should send two players back court to help relieve some pressure terry had draymond and iggy after him and the closest teammate to him is like 30 ft away
pos,Pos,celtics could use a guy like rozier
neg,Pos,rip we re the larriors again gg hornets
pos,Neg,we building a brick factory in there
neg,Pos,we definitely deserved to lose but i do wanna say one thing watching mason plumlee play basketball makes me wanna gouge my eyes out
pos,Pos,what the heck was the final play supposed to be
neg,Pos,soon as oubre was ejected i think we all knew
pos,Pos,is warriors hornets the best random cross conference rivalry in the nba of course you have the dell curry connection then there s the lamelo wiseman draft thing then you have kelly oubre who left the warriors for the hornets on a kinda sour note and there s also the whole draymond and bridges facing each other as two of the best players out of msu piece all of this has made for a bunch of really exciting games over the past two seasons including that one game last season where draymond got ejected and terry rozier hit the insane buzzer beater game winner fun stuff
pos,Pos,is this the best day in charlotte s sports history
pos,Pos,what an ending lol that hornet commentator always cracks me up
pos,Pos,between this and the panthers cardinals game with cam s comeback and all that man what a day
neg,Neg,ok cool game and all but wtf is this guy s username
pos,Pos,dubs can t win on the east coast fake contenders
neg,Neg,this game was ugly as fuck lmao
neg,Neg,tough shooting night for steph
pos,Pos,hornets beat the league best warriors cam comes back and helps beat the league best cardinals what a day
pos,Neg,everyone not name wigs and kuminga fucking sold
pos,Pos,hornets played insane fucking defense on steph tonight
pos,Pos,good day in carolina pro sports against 1 loss teams
pos,Pos,felt like half our team had their worst games of the year wtf was that
pos,Neg,bridges has definitely taken a big leap this year
pos,Pos,how did draymond get out jumped
pos,Pos,cam back canes the best team in hockey 2 0 charlotte weekend hornets panthers both beat the best team in their respective leagues nc sports might finally be uncursed boyos
neg,Neg,kerr played 3 non shooters with looney igoudala draymond next to curry and wiggins the last 5 mins when they were struggling to score i get draymond and igoudala but why is looney in the game when you re struggling to score plumblee isn t jokic
pos,Pos,kuminga 11 is impressive
pos,Pos,hornets one of them teams pop off any game
neg,Pos,gg hornets you guys played great
pos,Pos,miles bridges is not on a mip level right now man is an all star
neg,Neg,welcome to the beat the dubs club hornets
pos,Pos,that s gotta be our worst game of the season so far
pos,Neg,can t win shooting 20 from 3 onto the next
pos,Neg,steph curry is just a budget seth curry
pos,Pos,that 4th quarter was tough to watch
pos,Neg,they put a lineup of steph iggy loon dray wiggs idk how in the world you expect to get any offense from that
pos,Pos,weird reffing but definitely our best win so far
pos,Pos,kuminga and wiggins looked really good weird to have a bunch of construction workers on the court with them though
neg,Neg,all good because how can the warriors go 80 2 without 2 losses
pos,Pos,this was a game where they could have used a klay
pos,Pos,who would win in a fight a team that s only lost once all season or a buzzi boi
neg,Neg,scary terry gonna terrorize the league
pos,Pos,i just love listening to eric collins call games he makes the most mundane plays sound hype af lol
pos,Pos,hah finally they faced a good team exposed
pos,Pos,yeah this road trip is gonna be an acid test for the warriors still their losses being an ot loss to memphis and a tight loss to an improved charlotte team are a good sign they re not 73 9 good but they ll definitely be a top 4 seed
neg,Pos,lookslike we finally played a good team
pos,Pos,gsw gotta find a better balance of the offense defense lineups just not enough creation or outlets on a bunch of the lineups they rolled out to close the game hornets always fun to watch i hate terry rozier
pos,Pos,free kuminga
pos,Neg,terry
pos,Neg,that s that cam newton energy
pos,Pos,oh terry two beauties
neg,Pos,curry 14 somehow not too worried as we have a few games in hand but the dream of another 70 win season would ve kept me going for ages
neg,Pos,i m so ready for a center that can dunk
pos,Pos,how do you do
pos,Pos,kuminga was the only bright spot
pos,Pos,that s what happens when they win the third quarter by only one point
pos,Pos,this game was so weird
pos,Pos,9 of 39 on 3pt jeez some nights you re hot some others you re cold and today the warriors were frozen gg to the hornets
pos,Pos,i m surprised we didn t get blown out by the way we were shooting
pos,Pos,is anyone gonna mention op s name or nah
pos,Pos,terry from time to time is the greatest to ever play this game
pos,Pos,gg hornets this game was back and forth all night we just went cold as ice at the end there
pos,Pos,andrew wiggins was the warriors super idol today
pos,Pos,really good win where our defense showed up for the second time in a row also caught gsw on a bad night shooting which is really nice jalen played some very good airtight defense on steph in the fourth which is dope
neg,Pos,horrible officiating on both sides of the court yikes
pos,Pos,if curry shoots like garbage this team is as beatable as anyone good thing he usually doesn t
pos,Pos,deserved loss for the warriors but are we going to ignore the fact that the ref pretty much just passed the ball to rozier on the jump ball like wtf was that
pos,Pos,damn good night for charlotte sports
pos,Pos,warriors missing everything frustrating as hell
pos,Pos,23 from 3 yikes
pos,Neg,classic case of kerr over engineering things by playing injured d lee in the clutch who shot terribly and a combination of an offensive less iggy draymond and looney together resulting in a pathetic 4th quarter poole needs to rethink a lot of things starting with his shot selection it s a cardinal sin to play iggy at 37 with looney and draymond kuminga was shown to be extremely useful taking pressure off curry by driving to the rim
neg,Pos,i want more kuminga minutes
pos,Pos,the warriors can t handle two balls in a row
pos,Pos,is it just me or did the refs time travel to the 90s this game there was more laying of hands than a pentecostal convention not saying this skewed the game as it was consistently called the same both ways
pos,Pos,now i know why people call him scary terry
pos,Pos,trade steph he s washed
pos,Pos,warriors weakness is young athletic teams that move the ball and play high effort defense ala griz there is a blueprint to at least make their lives difficult but beating them is really only possible is steph goes as cold as he did
pos,Pos,7 22 3 13 from 3 curry is a scrub sarcasm
pos,Pos,cavs beat the hornets hornets beat the warriors therefore we re better than the warriors cavs 2022 nba champions
pos,Pos,that terry sure is scary
pos,Pos,as well as the hornets played the dubs just sucked tonight lol lee looked tired and out of shape and nobody could hit a shot and get going
pos,Pos,refs did all they could be between terry beating draymond for a jumpball and cody martin clamping steph curry we refused to be denied this w
pos,Neg,the nba really has to figure out how to do jump balls my idea was always to have a drone drop them from the top like 12 ft up refs fuck em up all the time
pos,Pos,finally faced a good team
pos,Pos,warriors offense played like a 1 11 team down the stretch
pos,Pos,this should not have been this close a game in which we basically couldn t make anything should probably have been a 10pt loss
pos,Pos,that post saying suns clippers and gsw all have a 7 game win streak jinxed it damn the clips are probably losing tonight too that means suns got that 8 game win streak though edit yup
pos,Pos,so are the hornets now a real team even though they lost the first game still trying to understand how this real team stuff works
neg,Pos,scary terry hours
pos,Neg,refs are so soft giving techs bc people don t like their bad calls lmao
pos,Pos,wiggins pulled a simmons
pos,Pos,despite the result i m glad to see wiggins ballin out
pos,Pos,kuminga looked awesome though seems way less raw than i was lead to believe obviously the shooting isn t there yet but the defense looks surprisingly good
pos,Pos,the referee faked out green with that throwup lmao also is it me or are they back to calling more again
neg,Pos,wth was that jump ball
pos,Pos,gg hornets surprisingly a great game worst game of the season for the warriors though
pos,Pos,potg is a close call between terry jump ball rozier or that weird af dance bit that performer did at halftime
neg,Pos,we couldnt hit a 3 to save our lives
neg,Pos,that fourth quarter was hideous jesus christ
pos,Neg,that was a hell of a game
pos,Pos,half joking but the warriors would have won if oubre played the whole game addition by subtraction
pos,Pos,kuminga is coming along fast this team doesn t need to be razor hot yet if they hit the groove at the right time though and stay healthy the warriors will be champs
pos,Pos,damn hornets had a really good shooting night but their defense was even more impressive they are growing as a team and hanging on like this shows it honestly though the warriors being 11 2 is incredibly impressive especially because their two losses have basically been down to the wire games also southeast division is going to be spicy this year heat wizards hornets and hawks are going to be absolutely fire
neg,Neg,cold shooting night charlotte played pretty well all good
pos,Pos,this game is ugly af no rhythm at all and they all look disjointed lmao
pos,Pos,miles bridges for mip
pos,Pos,greatest charlotte sports fan day ever
pos,Pos,sweet user name
pos,Pos,wwwwlwwwwwwwlarriors
neg,Pos,nice username op
pos,Pos,wow amazing sad i had to miss the 4th quarter but amazing to grab the win
pos,Neg,that 4th quarter warriors lineup had me scratching my head
pos,Pos,rofl steph was still 14 even when he s booty you still don t want him on the bench for too long
pos,Pos,warriors couldn t hit threes couple big missed free throws at the end it was close game though just one of those nights oubre getting throw out was fun for me as a warrior fan
neg,Pos,gsw def of die or win by the 3 ball they were not dropping today good learning experience to adjust game plan
neg,Neg,this offensive line tonight was the worst ninja ever
pos,Pos,the charlotte announcers are the best in the league
neg,Neg,warriors shot 9 39 from 3 and it was still down to the wire
pos,Pos,worst game we ve had all season sheesh fun game if it wasn t for refs maybe gg bees bros
neg,Neg,it took three hornets players to score 20 each and steph shooting poorly for the warriors to lose in regulation for the first time this season warriors finna pull a john wick this season
pos,Pos,buzz buzz mother fuckers terry with the bunnies then two beauties
pos,Pos,the lesson here is that you don t toss oubre for no reason
pos,Pos,looks like steph s gonna drop 40 on the nets coming up prolly on like 80 ts
neg,Neg,this game wasn t fun at all to watch crowd wasn t into it the warriors missed a ton of shots and there was just no flow with the refs involvement
pos,Neg,scary hours
neg,Neg,that awful 3pt shooting really killed warriors they are now a fake contender after this loss lol
pos,Pos,f the refs i knew they wanted the warriors to lose and proved it by throwing oubre out of the game
pos,Neg,nba is rigged refs ejected oubre to force the hornets to play someone better
pos,Neg,great game
neg,Pos,warriors exposed season done going 11 71 rest of season hornets basically won the chip with this win
pos,Pos,how do you lose that jump ball as green that s embarrassing
pos,Pos,scary terry said fuck your winning streak
pos,Pos,warriors are a fake team signed a salty bulls fan
pos,Neg,refs literally throwing the game to rozier on the jump ball lol
pos,Pos,honestly too many bad play from the warriors at the end curry being too unselfish there he could have make that shot but he gives it to looney and he missed 2 free throw iggy and draymond could have force a 8 sec backcourt but obviously it understandable that they can t make that quicks decision but draymond green getting outjumped by a guard come on last play either try to make a easy 2 or make a 3 wiggins has a easy 2 there but he pass it out so i assume he wanted a 3 but dl didn t know that it was not a good shooting night for both team the refs obviously favor the warriors this game but warriors just don t have a good shooting night to use that favor
neg,Neg,weird username dude
neg,Neg,that jumpball toss was all the way on the left side lol dude had money on the game
neg,Neg,here it comes we re exposed still in the league
pos,Pos,steph curry is mvp 76 6
pos,Pos,olympic mills sighting
pos,Pos,who needs kyrie when you got patty mills
pos,Pos,patty just grinding okc into flour that s why they call him mills
pos,Pos,worst game by giddey so far bazley also didn t show up today it s hard to battle against these nets when two of your starters are playing like that on the bright side another great game on offence by dort great hustle by jre and good overall game for poku jerome wiggins good l we will be better
pos,Neg,imagine if harden and durant had the team that just kd and kyrie had with allen and dinwiddie
pos,Pos,hope harris is ok
pos,Pos,does patty mills game translate to the playoffs
pos,Neg,played well and got the l we re back on track boys
pos,Pos,it s nice having the best player in the league
pos,Pos,patty mills has been the steal of the off season for the nets
pos,Pos,it has to be demoralizing when the opponent goes on a bit of a run in the fourth and then nash just inserts durant back into the game to extinguish any hope they have of coming back
pos,Pos,what s 9 times 3
neg,Pos,patty giving his fellow aussie his welcome to the nba moment
pos,Pos,durant kevin
pos,Neg,i hope harris is fine if not patty will get a bigger role
pos,Pos,good loss starting to win too many there
pos,Pos,fun game
pos,Pos,bandwagon here love the nets
pos,Pos,score makes it look like blow out but okc never went away for most of the game unfortunately the nets have kevin wayne durant and patty the lost curry brother mills aldridge lowkey regressing lol no ways he could keep up that shooting
neg,Neg,how many points would cam thomas average if he was on okc
pos,Pos,kd mvp
pos,Pos,it sounds like an overreaction but brooklyn is a ecf lock hope we ll see bulls nets in eastern finals
pos,Pos,kyrie becoming less relevant every game lol seriously good game from mills and the nets
pos,Pos,kd still a bitch though
pos,Pos,the thunder had 10 guys combine for 53 points that is not a recipe for success everyone not name lu dort and sga shot 30 combined lmao
pos,Pos,mills what a signing he s becoming
pos,Pos,nuggets still have not allowed 100 or more points at home this season
pos,Pos,really excited for what the future holds for bones
pos,Pos,hyland looking hella good out there
pos,Pos,nuggets are deep as fuck if they manage to get everyone healthy before the playoffs they will be very hard to beat
neg,Neg,bones hyland for roty
neg,Neg,denver didn t trail for even a second of this game
neg,Neg,munder
neg,Pos,if all the nuggets role players play like this we are definitely a championship caliber team when murray comes back
pos,Pos,nuggets still haven t allowed 100 points in a home game
pos,Pos,bones may be the steal of the draft we love him already
neg,Pos,how is it possible jokic got significantly even better that fast since his mvp season
pos,Pos,the 2021 22 nuggets can hit 3 point shots according to this game and only this game
pos,Pos,mvp looking good out there alongside jokic welcome to the boneyard
neg,Neg,jokic per above 35 after this game
neg,Neg,psh jokic scrub not even a double double cut this guy please
pos,Neg,jokic does more in 3 quarters than 99 9 of the league players do in 4
pos,Pos,jokic is the mvp front runner
pos,Neg,3 starters out and our bench still went off for 63 points everyone really stepped up tonight
pos,Pos,put me out of my misery and blow it up already i can only take so many bong rips to get through the inevitable keeping it close only to blow a 7 0 run and fight back just to be down 9 before repeating itself
pos,Pos,first of many times that portland will be in the bonezone better get used to it
neg,Neg,is jokic the goat lmao
neg,Neg,if it wasn t obvious before it is now this team isn t a championship team the desire for a championship seems to come only from lillard we have an entirely new coach and we are trying a new more difficult offense and defense which we currently suck at fans knew we would suck at it from when stotts tried briefly and gave up we knew we would lose games as we kept at it and tried to be better apparently only the fans knew because our team is regressing hard no one is putting in any effort anymore to be better they play like a ship without a captain completely aimless they are just on autopilot and don t seem to care about getting good enough to win a championship only care if they are winning the current game just depressing either the rest of this team needs to be whipped into caring and learning real determination or we need to blow the team up and save lillard s sanity i know we joke alot about mj s intensity but this seriously is a situation where lillard would be fully justified taking a page from mj i simply see no reason for lillard to return and potentially reinjure himself trying to carry them until the rest of the team shows they can play on their own and care about being a championship team
pos,Pos,one of the best all around games i ve seen from the nuggets in a while and that s without murray mpj and barton shout out to our bench that was fantastic bones especially
pos,Pos,jokic hates portland always cooks them hard
neg,Neg,it was a murder denver s second unit lit it up in the 3rd i m a little bummed jokic sat the whole 4th would ve liked seeing back to back triple doubles
pos,Pos,denver having 9 wins with this roster is crazy to me every uear its a straight jokic carry while so many guys are so injured
pos,Pos,this team is disaster squared we must blow it up
neg,Neg,our bench was good but the blazers defensee was just awful all around i saw some early blazer games and though they would be better but honestly it seems they continually need dame to score 50 to win our bench isn t that great but that defense made us look elite
pos,Pos,nuggets bench did too good of a job so jokić misses out on his td
pos,Neg,we don t deserve dame we looking like a straight up lotto team without him at least i get to enjoy watching him wear my team s jersey just a bit longer d
pos,Pos,are bench played so fucking good tonight
pos,Pos,painful
pos,Pos,looks like a bones day
pos,Pos,smh blazers not helping sad
pos,Pos,watching this portland team play is giving me depression everyone in the team seems so off
neg,Pos,sengun looks really good out there i m impressed by him
pos,Pos,chris paul has a vendetta against houston the 7 steals were one thing but that nutmeg was totally unnecessary
pos,Pos,i liked this game very stress free and we got to rest our starters plenty for the back to back i still can t stand how monty chooses to sit booker for so long in the second when he s on a hot start in the first but it didn t bite us in the ass this time at least cp3 may have ruined a young man s career at it s very start that was cold gg houston now everyone go look for the copypasta
neg,Neg,
neg,Neg,this sub loves piling on the lakers but why is no one talking about the defending western conference champion suns being 1 3 i didn t realize until now that the suns are currently 1 3 why is no one talking about this they lost to a mediocre kings team a couple days ago and nearly lost by 30 pts to the trailblazers with a struggling damian lillard and from what i know they re just about fully healthy for anyone actively watching the suns this season what s the main reason for the early season struggles you would think they d have a bunch of momentum to start the season after their amazing finals run
pos,Pos,if javale and frank can keep producing when ayton is back look out i love this team
pos,Pos,tankero for banchero still on
pos,Pos,give sengoat more minutes
pos,Pos,i don t care what anyone says about javale mcgee he was made for this team i am curious to see how ayton returns to this team with how the kaminsgee rotation is playing
pos,Pos,gotta say i love sengun s game good player
neg,Pos,an ugly stretch in the second but these last two games we are finally getting back to playing the way we were last year that wasn t really true before that even though we were winning games and still no ayton
pos,Pos,8 in a row nice to see the bench manage a lead successfully gg
pos,Pos,our backup centers are nuts imagine when aytons back
pos,Pos,monster game by mcgee
pos,Pos,yo we are absolutely hyper ass this year please lord give us chet
pos,Pos,how the hell did houston win a game this year oh i see it was against okc lol
pos,Pos,jalen green hasn t played good but man they need a real point guard facilitating that offense kevin porter jr is a shoot first guard who provides nothing else besides scoring
neg,Neg,javale was a great pick up for the suns we should have tried him instead of tacko
pos,Neg,its honestly embarrassing to see the rockets play
pos,Pos,this sub loves piling on the lakers but why is no one talking about the defending western conference champion suns being 1 3 i didn t realize until now that the suns are currently 1 3 why is no one talking about this they lost to a mediocre kings team a couple days ago and nearly lost by 30 pts to the trailblazers with a struggling damian lillard and from what i know they re just about fully healthy for anyone actively watching the suns this season what s the main reason for the early season struggles you would think they d have a bunch of momentum to start the season after their amazing finals run
pos,Pos,cp3 for mvp
pos,Pos,wait weren t the sun s having a slow start when the hell did they get to 9 3
pos,Pos,cp7
neg,Pos,i wonder if houston gets a on pace to be the worst team of all time post made about them shitting on the rockets don t get enough upvotes so it might not happen
pos,Pos,jalen green sucks
neg,Neg,so i guess demar derozan just decided to activate a second peak huh
pos,Pos,beep beep big bounce back game bring on lebron
neg,Neg,zach lavine makes basketball just so much more enjoyable to watch so effortlessly making super difficult shots
neg,Neg,derozan s an all star
pos,Pos,lavine always cooks us doesnt he this time no kawhi to save us regardless good game if has pg a dark house mvp case so does demar or lavine arturas should be a lock for executive of the year
neg,Pos,alex caruso has never lost a game where he starts at pf
pos,Pos,what do you do when deballzach score 72
neg,Pos,just lost to the 82nd best player in the league
neg,Pos,you just lost to the worst signing of the off season
pos,Pos,gg bulls demar and lavine are amazing
pos,Neg,you gonna call
pos,Pos,demar derozan is an offensive weapon alex caruso with team high rebounds and tied for both team high assists and steals does all the little work
pos,Pos,demar is having a career year
pos,Pos,demar derozen worst fa signing btw
pos,Pos,gg bulls if we had to finally lose i m glad it was to a really good team when we couldn t capitalize on vuc being out it just made everything too much of a climb
pos,Neg,correction demar ended with 35 12 16 not 33 i was confused too because he had 33 but they didnt update the last second layup he got
pos,Pos,derozan s mid range is so wet
pos,Neg,big win for the bulls imo i think theyre the real deal at this point
pos,Pos,16 to 19 in tos sloppy game all around but a big win for the bulls
pos,Pos,i like how the bulls roster is constructed i like how they have 2 key players in ball and caruso who are dedicated to playing defense when those 2 are on the floor together the bulls defensive intensity instantly picks up
pos,Pos,lakers play the bulls tomorrow
pos,Pos,that 3 on 1 fastbreak towards the end where pg missed the three lmaooo why not go for a layup lost them the game imo
pos,Neg,demar and that mid range
pos,Pos,streakbusters are back
neg,Pos,shame we wasted all of pg s ft for the year on this game
pos,Pos,1 caruso is fucking amazing i love him so much 2 that dagger by zach dude is so fucking good 3 coby coming back league fucked
pos,Neg,gg bulls bros i love your team not at this exact moment but starting tomorrow i will again
pos,Pos,ak is a god two years ago this is a 30 point blow out now we re holding a conference contender to 90 points on the road love the bulls love demar
pos,Pos,here is a math problem to solve zubac had seven rebounds caruso had nine rebounds which one is taller
neg,Pos,what s a big man
pos,Pos,wwwwwww
pos,Pos,did the clippers know they were allowed to take a 2 at the end of the game there
pos,Pos,clips shot very poorly
pos,Pos,derozan still has it
pos,Pos,is lebron playing tomorrow or is he too scared of the carushow
pos,Pos,1q i awake 2q i sleep 3q i still sleep 4q i arise
pos,Pos,drive home safe la beep beep
neg,Pos,gg bulls our bois finally ran out of gas and couldnt buy a bucket credit for trying until the end lets go clips
pos,Pos,it s very nice of the lakers to be unofficial sponsors of the eastern conference this season
pos,Pos,gg clippers enjoyed listening to your announcers too thought they were really fair for both sides
pos,Pos,gg bulls bros glad to see you guys balling out again deebo is a star the clippers new 0 2 starts now
pos,Pos,clippers commentators pretty good
pos,Pos,41 mins for pg
pos,Pos,gg clips man our bench couldn t get into double digits can t wait for coby to come back
pos,Pos,derozan is my dedaddy
neg,Pos,caruso 16 start forever
pos,Pos,good game to the real team of la
pos,Pos,damn when did zach get those 27 shots up i thought he had half that many attempts
pos,Pos,we re for real
pos,Neg,gg bulls ya ll are fun to watch just not against us
pos,Pos,gg to the clippers first win all year where i really thought we were gonna lose quick question to clipper nation how is ty lue as a head coach
pos,Pos,this bulls team is fun to watch
pos,Pos,man as soon as lavine hit that dagger i got up and left to beat the rush and get myself a bacon wrapped hot dog out front lol
pos,Pos,not our prettiest game but gg to the bulls
pos,Pos,debaldballzach strikes again
pos,Pos,pg talking to the fans after the final buzzer was wholesome
pos,Pos,carushow 16
pos,Pos,the clipper s 3 2 defense looking thing in the second half disrupted the bulls a fair bit but derozen and lavine were great down the stretch and the clippers couldn t hit their shots
pos,Pos,demar derozan is top 5 mvp candidate kiss me about it
pos,Pos,man clippers sold big time all game great defence and shot making by the bulls
pos,Pos,gg bulls we played like doodoo and shot even worse it s kinda nice in a way to be missing your best player for a whole season every win feels immaculate and every loss you can just shrug and go well we were missing our best player
neg,Neg,deeeeebo that s my former raptor
pos,Pos,ggs to the clips paul george has been on a tear this year i m a big fan of terrance mann s game if we can beat the lakers tomorrow i feel like the west coast trip will already be successful also demar for president of the us prime minister of canada
neg,Neg,i am just like derozan when i shoot it it goes in
pos,Pos,didn t know i would get the chance to watch prime derozan but here we are
pos,Pos,bro you absolutely cannot go small against the bulls defense
pos,Pos,if demar ever wins mvp however low the odds i think thatd be the 2nd most happy moment for me in basketball aside from winning the chip in 2019
pos,Pos,lmao our announcers calling the pg superstar foul call before it happened
pos,Neg,so happy derozan is doing well on this team he s one of the most likeable guys in the nba for me
pos,Pos,alex caruso
pos,Pos,shout out to our bulls fans turning away games into home games they was deep out there in cali tonight
pos,Pos,you just lost to deballzach
pos,Pos,i don t get how zach had one ft that game
pos,Pos,derozan has improved so much after leaving the raptors it s like he is a much different player out there
pos,Pos,demar showing us what its like to play against kawhi
pos,Pos,35 on 12 16 gimme that hot sauce demar
pos,Pos,not compalining but it s funny how demar s gaining a lot of praise this year when he s been doing the exact same thing since he s with the spurs
neg,Neg,they messed around and gave zach a team that can actually go somewhere besides home at the end of the season and he just been showing off
pos,Pos,soo simmons for caruso
pos,Pos,demar was crazy good
pos,Pos,no vuc no pat williams no coby white nice adjustments with the lineups to hold this team to 90
neg,Neg,the comeback clippers are no match for the 4th qtr bulls
pos,Pos,when the clippers get the l i get a little chubby dude
pos,Neg,lavine s good and all but this is demar s team now damn the way he would bring up the ball and be ready to either bully or just splash the sweet midrange was so good to watch lonzo and caruso not as good attacking but the defense was good
pos,Pos,i ve been preaching at the temple of demar for a long time i m glad people are finally realizing how good he is
neg,Pos,nice win by the los angeles bulls lavine derozan and ball are all from out there and went to ucla or usc respectively vuc also went to usc even though he s out
pos,Pos,you know how to stay in the game when you re responsible for 25 of your teams misses 9 rebounds 3 steals 5 assists i m calling a stl ast rbd triple double for ac at some point this season
pos,Pos,derozen showing out this year and i love it
pos,Pos,bulls have to get better at not committing turnovers when teams double zach and demar the offense gets real sloppy when defenses start to switch up schemes and lonzo had to smooth out his consistency dude is way too streaky with his shooting i think he s been blocked more going while driving to the basket then actually having makes either way it wasn t a pretty game but a win is a win
pos,Pos,derozan is fuckin good this season
pos,Pos,over the last couple games it s been really clear what vucevic brings to the team they have played well in his absence mark of a good team but there are stretches where the lack of size in the middle really limits what they can do especially when only one of ddr and zlv are out there too easy to double the scorer up top and make the others on the floor try to beat you
neg,Neg,did derozan play against the warriors how did the warriors blow out the bulls then lose to the hornets lol
pos,Pos,great game clippers pg got hacked a bit at the end but the bulls also kept responding zach lavine is a killer
pos,Pos,the bald mamba out here clappin cheeks left and right y all better watch out
pos,Pos,demar is scoring quite a few 30 games this year
pos,Pos,the jayson tatum experience
neg,Neg,it s quite impressive how the wolves made rubio look washed
pos,Neg,although the cavs lost ricky rubio is really showing the league what he s made of
pos,Pos,denzel valentine 21 minutes dean wade 34 minutes that s the summary also mobley is not a 5 lol
pos,Pos,a win is a win i suppose scoring rubio is a scary sight
neg,Neg,can t be too upset over this loss cavs kept it close despite all of our injuries and missing players tonight
neg,Pos,the week this year that tatum consistently makes 25 points on under 20 shots will be a good time
pos,Pos,ugly
pos,Pos,they should ve let rubio keep shooting the ball in the 4th he was on a roll
pos,Pos,cedi s resurgence has been one of my favorite parts of this season even if today it still meant a loss
pos,Neg,cavs played great being down 3 5 starters they really got rubio for the change between the couch cushions huh
pos,Pos,where are the cavs players wtf are they all injured
pos,Pos,definitely an ugly game but cool to see horford and rubio play like some beasts ive always felt like neither of them get enough credit
pos,Pos,being down 4 starters really fucked us if i have to see valentine get serious minutes again i will stab my eyes out
neg,Neg,ugly win vs a banged up cleveland team but we won and al is my daa aaa aaa d
neg,Neg,i am so sorry guys i played evan mobley for the first time in dfs today this one is on me
pos,Pos,dean wade played seemingly 56 minutes in this basketball game including the entirety of crunch time as a small ball 5 getting dusted repeatedly by schroder to seal it hard to watch that in what was otherwise a really entertaining game
pos,Pos,can t be too upset we were playing our canton charge lineup for most of the night
pos,Pos,al horford just gave mobley his welcome to the nba moment
pos,Pos,why cant tatum have one nice efficient game why
pos,Pos,0 11 on mobley yikes
pos,Pos,that was definitely a basketball game
pos,Pos,big performances by schroder and smart in the final 5 minutes there
pos,Pos,we played hard and managed to keep it close basically half the team is out if mobley is injured too were fucked and season will turn ugly fast also im not on the tacko train anymore he is not a replacement for jarrett allen at all front office needs to get out the meme train
pos,Pos,mobley looks tired and a little hurt
pos,Pos,ah the al horford revenge game after an embarrassing loss just the player we expected to have a bounce back game
pos,Pos,grant williams with the high water mark of a 10
pos,Neg,hope the cavs are a little more healthy for the nets gs then nets again damn
pos,Pos,out of 82 games of basketball that was one
pos,Pos,did boston play the cavs in cleveland consecutive games lol i ve never seen that before in a regular season schedule usually it s a home and home
pos,Neg,no love markk sexton allen and no mobley for the fourth qtr idc if he shot poorly he was huge on d not going to win many games with those outs
pos,Pos,that was a fun game
pos,Pos,well that was something
pos,Pos,c s were a play in team last year i thought they d be a 5 9 seed this year with 4 a possibility if things broke right looking like a 6 10 seed if i m being generous
pos,Neg,hold up this game goes against my narrative that tatum an all nba 23 year old forgot how to play basketball must be a deepfake
neg,Neg,impressive fight without 4 starters of ours
neg,Neg,i m gonna be 100 honest here this guy dean wade is so fucking bad lmao
neg,Neg,hard to win a game when you re giving valentine and tacko 30 mins and 10 mins respectively we are far and away the better team just some unfortunate circumstances
pos,Pos,reddit thread about mobley being cavs best player proceeds to go 0 11 most predictable thing ever
pos,Neg,i missed the mobley injury is he like hurt hurt
pos,Pos,what the eff happened to mobley
neg,Neg,mobley s first bad game feeling worse than i should about it but that s how much he s spoiled us so far great job beantown on to the next one
pos,Pos,i d straight up trade smart for rubio and a 1st round pick without any hesitation
pos,Pos,congrats the cavs were missing sexton love lauri allen stevens technically a loss and mobley in the 3rd
pos,Pos,evan mobley with the career high lol
neg,Pos,start kanter over time lord
pos,Pos,kings fans crying in the club
pos,Neg,pretty sure kings fans would ve preferred a loss and a luke walton firing
pos,Pos,good signs for fox 9 assists no turnovers bad signs 19 shots to get 19 points just not attacking the rim like he was past two years at all super weird had a legit argument for being the best guard finisher in the league last year and it s not like kings lack spacing i still need to check tracking numbers against prior seasons might just be confirmation bias but doesn t feel like he s attacking at all that being said kings still have a top ten offense so maybe its wrong thing to focus on idk strange year for him so far
pos,Pos,happy taking losses like this if cade is showing what he can be for us
pos,Pos,luke walton reported extend 5 years after this win
pos,Pos,cade had a great game and i m happy to see saben lee again
pos,Pos,i got to watch my steelers tie the lions and keep walton against the pistons thanks detroit
neg,Pos,the pistons are in that rebuilding stage where their players are putting up great lines but they just don t win
pos,Pos,tell me how to feel
neg,Neg,tyrese 15 to lead all kings
neg,Pos,that s buddy hield
pos,Pos,people need to stop over reacting to a small sample size especially when cade missed all of preseason training camp however asking society to display common sense on any topic these days is a herculean task
pos,Neg,fuck i wanted luke gone
pos,Neg,i m fully out on casey unless he is intentionally putting out bad player rotations to lose the guys he puts on the floor together makes no fucking sense
pos,Pos,god damn it
neg,Neg,big win for luke walton job security was looking rough if he lost this
neg,Neg,trade everyone but cade and bey thank you
pos,Pos,we even suck at losing
pos,Pos,detroit young bucks lookin good
pos,Pos,luke waltons job security in good hands now
pos,Pos,won t win many games where the other team shoots that well but as a pistons fan i don t want to see us lose this bad the worst part though was how bad killian played yeesh
pos,Pos,man hayes was awful he needed that bounce back game after playing well the last one
pos,Neg,good bey cunningham playing great cojo barely playing bad jeremi fucking grant hayes isaiah missing a lot of wide open layups zero effort on d and josh jackson on to next fuck casey for benching diallo trying to teach him a lesson
neg,Pos,glad to see rodney mcgruder is still in the nba
pos,Pos,didn t watch the game only looked at the box score what s happening with jerami grant
pos,Pos,kings giving luke new life
pos,Pos,pistons have a nice up and coming squad cade killian saddiq jeremi
pos,Pos,it s lonely up here but i think i see some nets fans off in the distance s
pos,Neg,d e n i t e n t i a r y also naw is really frustrating to watch and im not even a pels fan
pos,Pos,i ve never been so excited in my life to be a wizards fan time to go to the wizards bed
pos,Pos,deni avdija is a menace 18 wow
neg,Neg,crazy how this team finds a way to win games down double digits in the 2nd half and the whole time i believed we d come back what the fuck is this feeling
neg,Pos,wow i really thought i wasn t gonna see the bed tonight this team is so deep dinwiddie trez kcp kuzma and deni all had nice streches during that comeback i m really impressed by deni s defense
pos,Neg,i ve watched some wizards games bc i bet their over on wins deni advija is such a good defender
pos,Pos,sheets are dirty tonight
pos,Pos,so deni is a lockdown defender why didn t anyone tell me that best of luck wizards y all were great tonight i have lots of respect for y all
neg,Pos,i ve watched several wizards games this season and i m really impressed with everyone s poise and attitude shift in the 4th quarter time and time again i see their mindset shift to takeover mode as the final minutes play out everyone was on point on both ends of the court and they locked out the pelicans for a good 6 game minutes it was insane the pelicans would get into the paint or try to shoot and everyone on the court knew just what to do for a long time i considered the wizards to be a massive disappointment and this season i have moved past that
pos,Neg,
pos,Neg,spencer dinwiddie
neg,Pos,avdija with the 18 back to back wizards wins with his minutes as their high water mark he is the only wizard this year to lead in more than one win he has done so in 3 of their 10 wins
pos,Pos,i have always somewhat doubted how large an impact coaches in the nba make compared to players wuj vs scott brooks has me second guessing that unseld jr is phenomenal it always feels like the right guys are on the floor for any given moment
neg,Neg,avdija is a monster not an overreaction to have him sniffing dpoty
pos,Neg,deni is so fucking good on defense like holy shit its incredible
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,pelicans shot 52 4 from 3 and still lost
pos,Neg,it s bed time
pos,Pos,a very impressive loss from the pels blew the doors of them then threw away the lead with dynamic efficiency all aboard the tank
neg,Pos,how i looked at my phone and saw the wizards down 19 in the third no beal and thought the game was done how
neg,Pos,damn thats how a no 1 team should play this wizard team is legit not sure how they ll perform in the playoffs but for the regular season they might be the jazz version this year from last year
pos,Neg,great defensive effort crawling back this team has guts
pos,Pos,just when i thought the difference between scott brooks and wuj couldn t be greater
pos,Pos,kd don t you wish you came to the wizzzzz
pos,Pos,washington was favored by 4 1 2 points
pos,Pos,take that doubters bet you think we re the best team now
neg,Neg,first seed in the east this some kinda long ass fever dream from getting the vaccine and i been asleep for 6 months
pos,Pos,a psa from everyone s favorite big
pos,Pos,deni dpoy
pos,Pos,deni with an 11 10 deni deni
pos,Neg,betting on the other team whenever the pelicans have a big lead at halftime is free money
neg,Neg,wizards bed is going to break soon if we keep this up
neg,Neg,x locked up in the denitentiary x
pos,Pos,i feel bad for the new orleans players tbh
neg,Neg,wizards officially have my attention haven t watched a game yet but i look forward to seeing one
neg,Neg,you will show respect to the wizards for now
neg,Neg,avdija dpoy
pos,Pos,deni avdija
neg,Pos,deni is the reason why we won this
neg,Neg,live by the swishkeil die by the brickeil alexander walker
pos,Pos,dying inside
pos,Pos,brandon ingram should give his fga s to jv let the lightning loose 20 20 on the season lets go
neg,Pos,dang these wizards are scary i ve always had the wizards as the team i liked the most after the knicks i m happy to see them killing it right now especially happy for spencer to be more successful than kyrie right now
neg,Neg,bed bed bed i ve never been so confused by a team meme and i follow baseball religiously
pos,Pos,deni s serving up a double double ugly game but at least they recovered from that abysmal first half
pos,Pos,you know what time it is
neg,Neg,the denitentiary strikes again
pos,Pos,deni
neg,Pos,pain
pos,Pos,the pelicans blah the chase for the seed is gonna have to wait another day
neg,Neg,til the wizards are 10 3 damn i haven t been keeping up with the nba too well this season lol
pos,Pos,where we fucking tonight
pos,Pos,100 is significantly greater than 105 officials need to have a look at this result
pos,Pos,wizards bed now everyone get in
pos,Pos,dinwiddie coin looking bullish for the end of the year
pos,Neg,i love this team man they re so fun to watch
neg,Neg,sato with the 17 minute single or triple single if you count assists turnovers and personal fouls
neg,Neg,dinwiddie trez and deni get to sleep in the bed tonight
pos,Pos,bi went cold man
pos,Pos,ok i havent been paying much attention to the league outside of the bulls this season but how tf are the wizards this good what moves did they make this offseason
neg,Neg,we fuckin on the wizards bed tonight baby
pos,Pos,wes unseld jr winning coach of the year in his first season would be so cool considering the feat his father did as a player
neg,Neg,we still win even when we play like absolute dogshit for like 80 percent of the game should never be that bad against a team like new orleans though
neg,Pos,bout to hit a wiz game baby
pos,Pos,very competitive tanking
pos,Pos,pain
neg,Neg,are we legit
neg,Neg,put some fuckin respect on deni avdija half these muthafuckas that cover the league as their fuckin job cant even say his name properly
pos,Pos,i love to see deni doing so well i was extremely high on him as a draft prospect very high iq player that wins games
pos,Pos,i refuse to believe nola isn t intentionally tanking at this point they should just have zion run suicides and have the fans bet on how many he can do before he drops for half time entertainment looking at the shape he is in he might just last long enough for this to be entertainment for a timeout
pos,Pos,what a choke job
neg,Pos,prepare the wizards bed
pos,Pos,its bed time boys
pos,Pos,east runs through pelicans ingram and zion are gone 100
pos,Pos,lmao pelicants what are you guys doing
pos,Neg,free bi
neg,Pos,when will mr gumbo play any timeline or na
pos,Pos,goat tanking by pels
neg,Pos,i can t imagine the pain that comes with being a pels fan
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,classic easy stuff pelicans suck
pos,Pos,pelican ts
pos,Pos,give ingram some help dammit n
neg,Pos,new orleans with the celtics type beat
pos,Pos,how did the wizards win this game when the pelicans had scored 9 332622 x 10 157 points
neg,Pos,i bet if the pelicans tank for a top pick they ll be really good soon
neg,Pos,embrace the tank let zion get healthy and get into good shape for next season so his career isn t 6 injury riddled seasons
neg,Neg,the pelicans suck don t they
neg,Pos,another game they would win if they had zion
pos,Pos,why u have a dame cover
neg,Pos,real story clint capela looked great tonight thats two good games back to back by him think he s getting healthy clint doing what he does is huge to this team and i think often that goes understated
neg,Neg,game got so weirdly chippy lmao gg hawks
neg,Neg,get cole some help hes a star
pos,Pos,trae bowing at the refs back when they finally called an incredibly obvious foul for him after tons of contact was peak entertainment dudes gonna get fined though
neg,Neg,best game of the year so far from clint capela
neg,Pos,itll get better magic bros yall got alot of young talent
pos,Pos,bo mamba
pos,Neg,most of our young guys played well and we lost
pos,Pos,franz wagner is really good
pos,Neg,i gotta say even though orlando lost watching wcj becoming a dependable floor spacing big for the magic is nice to see
pos,Pos,bamba is a hilarious watch franz is a solid rook he s rough around the edges and sometimes struggles with the simple play but he will be good he played good defense on trae in the 4th on a few possessions better than most overall
pos,Pos,the hawks are 6 9 nice
neg,Pos,great win but the refs were in that 4th quarter like trae harden cp3 lebron the day after talking to the media about his ft rates and tom brady after a db stands withing 3 feet of him were on the floor everything was getting called also shoutout to wendell carter jr dropping an efficient 15 in the cartier frames
pos,Pos,ref s were on some bullshit in the last four minutes either they bet the over or they really hate mo bamba
neg,Pos,magic need to get the coach on board with tanking more more rj hampton minutes and less gary harris
pos,Pos,i for one am shocked we lost a game in which we could get wacked nonstop and not go to line
pos,Neg,i m just happy we finally won a fucking game holy shit edit d rose breathing extra heavy in the post game press conference right now x_x
pos,Pos,a highly physical indiana nyk game at the garden where neither team scores 100 this wine was of an excellent 1997 vintage
pos,Pos,i felt like a proud father watching rj hit that dagger i think i needed that as much as he did
pos,Pos,i cant tell if i should be thrilled or concerned that we won this game because of a virtuoso taj gibson defensive performance
pos,Neg,another game where the bench 20 and starters like 10
neg,Neg,fun fact that last three by rj actually impregnated six different women in yonkers
neg,Neg,the kniiiiiiiiiiiiiicckkssss
pos,Pos,apologies to the pacers social media intern that they can t post bing bong tonight
neg,Pos,knicks take off the ankle weights when they substitute in their bench
pos,Neg,switching randle onto turner was a good move compared to last time held everyone under 100 yeah defense
pos,Pos,obligatory
neg,Neg,this team belongs to rose randle is a secondary character
pos,Pos,every knicks starter was a minus every bench player was a plus lol
pos,Pos,sorry bout dat l bozo
pos,Pos,dear sir or madam
neg,Neg,rose for 6moty
pos,Pos,thank god
pos,Pos,saw the camera shake in rams game just assuming quickley whipped it out at the garden and that s an aftershock
pos,Pos,derrick rose is the goat
pos,Pos,myles domas brog duarte and tj only ones earning paychecks this year can we please close out a fucking game
pos,Neg,this was the most grit n grind game i ve seen in a while pacers held to 0 13 in the final 7 minutes
pos,Pos,being realistic how long before caris turns it on major struggles so far this year
pos,Pos,we definitely needed that win tonight
pos,Pos,i love a game like this
neg,Pos,signs of life for our defense
pos,Pos,this game may have just saved our season a bit hopefully we can win the next two and get seriously back on track
neg,Pos,if we could play defense the 1st 3 quarters like we did in crunch time that would be great
neg,Neg,another game where the knicks starters plus minus was all negative and bench positive wonder how much longer thibs sticks with the starting 5
neg,Neg,good heavens
pos,Neg,quickley played great but he probably shouldve been pulled out like 2 minutes sooner than he was man was super gassed by the end you could tell even before that sloppy foul he made man was walking from half court to the corner
neg,Neg,after a great 3rd quarter i felt like we might have been figuring it out then i was quickly reminded im a fan of the indiana pacers
pos,Pos,randle and rose in playoff form
pos,Pos,hard fought battle but the refs fail again
neg,Pos,this game could have been a 110 105 game easily if the refs called obvious fouls on both teams absolute atrocious refs in the name of letting them play
pos,Neg,new format for pgts or i guess since it s not automated op just chose to do it this way
neg,Neg,i volunteer my ankle as tribute
neg,Neg,its so hard to watch these non jokic minutes i feel bad for him
neg,Neg,we ve gotten so much better in clutch games holy shit
pos,Pos,porzingod back
pos,Neg,bullock with the game high 15 his minutes were the best for the mavericks in their last win also
pos,Pos,kristaps porzingis has been really fucking good
pos,Pos,this is payback for the broncos game last week
pos,Pos,kp is actually crushing this post game interview i somehow just became a fan of him lol
pos,Pos,holy fuck please be ok luka
pos,Pos,and this is why trading kp for peanuts is insanity he is far better than anything we could possibly get for him he raises the ceiling if this team so much what a great performance by him tonight
neg,Pos,great team chemistry by the mavs luka trusting his teammates and his teammates stepping up the nuggets missing some players but jokic had another insane game regardless
pos,Pos,every time nuggets play the opponents are looking to go on a run while jokic sits and it usually happens nuggets bench is so bad
pos,Pos,as a mavs fan for my entire life i ve learned to be patient with my 7 0 european big men even when the entire nba has already written them off
pos,Neg,ntilikia is the most underrated signing in this fa
neg,Neg,jokic is something else he really is the best center since shaq
pos,Neg,b2b good game from kp and this looks promising coz against jokic and this is why kidd insist playing 2 big kp can hold at 5 but not for entire game save him at 1st half and unleash it at 2nd half looks good he holds jokic few possesions in 2nd half just being tall with 7 6 wingspan
pos,Pos,here s your dallas mavs post game summary now in our 6th season 6 did the mavs win honestly one of our better wins of the season i swear our games are always so goddamn stressful outside of last game that was stressful just for us for other reasons luka with a near triple double tonight with 23 8 11 2 steals hopefully he s ok kp continues his uptrend with another great outing tonight of 29 10 3 2 1 with 5 3 s timmy came up big tonight with some big buckets including the dagger 3 off a ridiculous bounce finishing with 19 7 4 bench analysis brunson burner maintains his 6moty campaign with 17 2 6 with some big shots in the clutch to keep us in the lead 6 overall a great win to start this brutal schedule we re in for to cap off this month we got the suns next on wednesday
pos,Pos,this was our best game of the year by far hopefully luka is ok that being said i fully trust the rest of our team to be able to win games without him
pos,Pos,but at what cost
pos,Pos,if i ever see dwight powell in a closing lineup i will go to that mavs game get on the court and bitch slap kidd myself this lineup of brunson luka thj bullock kp to close out the game was absolutely beautiful
pos,Neg,joker deserves so much credit for what he us doing with this team right now missing murray and mpj and still getting this team to compete every night with a good record is impressive
pos,Pos,unicorn
neg,Neg,jokic can t carry so much weight
pos,Pos,what a fun game to watch kp lights out luka posting up jokic thj with a take over moment powel getting worked in the paint truly a mavs game
neg,Neg,please be ok luka
pos,Pos,isn t a dallas denver wcf matchup what we all really want i swear every game between us except that last one is just entertaining as hell please be okay luka
pos,Pos,jokic desperately needs some help jesus
neg,Neg,down 3 starters and were in it until the final couple of minutes it s a wasted huge performance by jokic but we ll be just fine when we re healthy again
pos,Pos,luka please have my ankles
pos,Pos,i ve had the impression that we arent a contender for the west but brunson thj doncic dfs porzingis playing like this
neg,Pos,frankey smokes seems to have everything we wanted from jrich and he is on a minimal deal
pos,Neg,i hope luka is okay fuck that looked nasty
pos,Neg,definition of phyrric victory feels hollow after the luka injury brunson should fill in well in his absence but damn man p t luka man
pos,Pos,is the nba the only sport in the world where schedule losses wins are a thing such a stupid concept when sports should aim to have polarity
pos,Pos,i dont want to hear anything jokic is the best player in the league right now
pos,Pos,hoping it s not a high ankle sprain for luka
pos,Pos,i really hope porzingis stays injury free
neg,Pos,i was told jason kidd is a bad coach
pos,Pos,could tell they were feeling that second night of a back to back in the 4th no energy on defense i m sure the mavs had this one circled on the calendar after our last game against them too oh well hopefully we can get more of our starters back asap
pos,Pos,hope luka is okay
pos,Pos,this team right now with all the injuries is basically just jokic and the guys and yet they usually win just on the b2b with so many guys out they just could not make it the end nuggets where leading most of the way to till early 4th quarter still have to applaud there effort tonight i m not sad about it
pos,Pos,makes me kind of sad to see such an effort by jokic go for naught however
pos,Pos,we needed this win badly for our confidence i get nuggets were undermanned and b2b but still big for us
pos,Pos,how everything just falls apart when jokic sits it s the reason he leads the league in advance stats our defense offence demeanor everything fucking breaks when jokic sits it s honestly insane jokic could play with the third steingers and do well but the moment he sits they forget they are basketball players and this isn t la fitness
pos,Neg,at what cost take my ankle luka
pos,Pos,we beat a good team
pos,Pos,the barton injury is what tipped the scales now its almost jokic alone morris is not enough as a second scorer last night the bench was super so we blew out the blazers but thats not going to happen on a nightly basis 3 starters down now and ag is a defensive guy so only 1 scorer jokic i mean we have our number 2 pg acting as our number 2 scorer nuggets need to get healthy
neg,Neg,jason kidd 9 4 rick carlisle 6 9
pos,Pos,if you hear a banshee wail echo in the distance that was me
pos,Pos,bench bad jokic good
pos,Pos,as a nuggets fan i am sad as a huge fan of latvia and the university of michigan i am happy
pos,Pos,mvp with a fantastic play as always shame the bench is actually terrible
pos,Pos,i ve seen some anemic bench units but rarely have i seen a bench unit that is so bad that the runs it gives up are soul crushing and fuck over the starters i d say we re down 2 starters to stagger in but those units weren t that good still
pos,Pos,gg s mavs i really hope luka will be alright
pos,Pos,when was the last time we had a ten game stretch without a starter injured 2
pos,Pos,that back and forth passing thing between kp and luka was disgusting unguardable perfection
pos,Pos,can the nuggets make a trade and get someone to play with this all time great
pos,Pos,who would look worse mavs without luka or nugs without jokic
pos,Pos,i m not mad that we lost this game but i am mad about the disrespect that jok gets from refs dude gets mugged every time he touches the ball with no calls
pos,Pos,on a bright side despite the loss jokic is back
pos,Pos,kp s best all round performance this season great defense on jokic and his shot has finally started to drop
pos,Pos,luka and brunson going right after jokic with fadeaways at the end was great
pos,Pos,the other day people were saying nuggets deep and bench good are you sure about that
pos,Pos,mavs roster seems uninspiring luka doesn t seem to be playing anything close to special but mavs are 9 4 idk what i think of them seeeing good porzingis is always nice though one of my favorites when he s not playing badly
neg,Neg,y all need to start taking mavs seriously as contenders in the west whither this subreddit likes it or not
pos,Pos,fuck that did not look good
neg,Pos,did help arrive for doncic
pos,Pos,also fun to see bones and bol get real minutes not in garbage time tonight
pos,Pos,bol bol is not an offensive rebound threat at all but i d like to see him get more minutes
pos,Pos,what s this the mavs winning against a decent team am i still dreaming
neg,Neg,am i the only one who gets slight ptsd from these two playing each other ya know because it was the last game before covid shut everything down
pos,Pos,why doesn t campazzo play anymore
pos,Pos,malone special close game lets run 5 bench players with no starter sometimes i really wonder how can someone be so
pos,Pos,not impressed by the nuggets at all basically rely on jokic to carry a bunch of role players i m supposed to believe this is a playoff team i just don t see it
pos,Pos,
neg,Pos,luka may have hurt his achilles
pos,Neg,if porzingis could play like this regularly luka wouldn t be eliminated in the 1st round
pos,Pos,
neg,Neg,yay bread and sportsball

pos,Pos,jjj with 18 7 with 2 steals and 2 blocks and only 1 foul
pos,Pos,somebody should tell this team that they don t get more ping pong balls based on point differential
pos,Pos,we are truly the worst team to ever exist
neg,Neg,close game could have gone either way really
pos,Pos,lmao
pos,Pos,look i m just gonna say it i m not having a good time this season i know we weren t going to win a lot of games and it s a building season but man this team is rough to watch rockets fans have been largely spoiled the last 15ish years we haven t had a truly bad team since about 20 years ago
pos,Pos,why do our threads always get posted late literally every game

neg,Neg,at what point is stephen silas chair warm there s losing when you re rebuilding and keeping it somewhat close and then there s this
pos,Neg,where is that gun we used to kill the maverick years ago give it to me
neg,Neg,the game was not as close as the score indicates
pos,Pos,bruh we cant compete against rockets they are too good tanking
pos,Pos,ja has shot 26 68 from 3 this season 38
pos,Pos,even with our 500 basketball memes this game needed to be a stomp our players need the confidence we need the win to stop our skid and i need it for my own personal sanity i turned this game off in the 4th because it was no longer worth watching but it felt good to just see us not turbo suck after the last few games were such depressing ls
pos,Pos,things will get better for us soon houston bros
pos,Pos,depressing how many awful teams there are this year
neg,Pos,should have traded kpj in the offseason
neg,Neg,rockets what do
pos,Pos,cp3 had like 20 points in the 4th quarter and yet the best player out there on the court for phoenix was d angelo russell
pos,Pos,chris paul after 3rd quarter 2 points paul at the end of game 21 points
pos,Pos,timberwolves fans and suns fans should file a class action lawsuit for damages done by that game
pos,Pos,what in the fuck is d lo thinking during the 4th ur star center has 10 points in the quarter and he s taking all the shots
pos,Pos,the suns couldn t miss down the stretch 9 10 stretch book and cp3 were both huge
neg,Neg,russell fucking sucks
neg,Neg,what the fuck did dlo do in the last 2 minutes
pos,Pos,this was the ugliest game i ve watched all season hell it may be the ugliest game i ve watched in many seasons i get that we were tired on a back to back but this felt excessively rough from both sides i m probably going to hear whistles in my sleep tonight god forbid the refs let the game have any flow or rhythm at least it s over though all of our suffering can end gg minnesota someone post the pasta
pos,Neg,last possession was the most timberwolves shit ever lmao
neg,Neg,lol kat had 35 and dlo ant still fucked it up
pos,Pos,listen i m not a basketball genius or anything but maybe minnesota should have more plays in crunch time go through kat and less through the guards he shot them into the game and dlo and ant lost it for them
neg,Neg,book da and cp3 had 72 of the suns 99 points
pos,Pos,this sub loves piling on the lakers but why is no one talking about the defending western conference champion suns being 1 3 i didn t realize until now that the suns are currently 1 3 why is no one talking about this they lost to a mediocre kings team a couple days ago and nearly lost by 30 pts to the trailblazers with a struggling damian lillard and from what i know they re just about fully healthy for anyone actively watching the suns this season what s the main reason for the early season struggles you would think they d have a bunch of momentum to start the season after their amazing finals run
neg,Pos,good shit by the suns rough start but they bounced back
pos,Pos,we tried our hardest to lose that game
pos,Neg,i still can t believe some of y all on this subreddit legit tried to tell us for years that devin armani booker wasn t a winning player lol
neg,Neg,some things in life are certain fourth quarter cp3 is one of them
pos,Pos,don t mind cutting it close with the hottest team in the nba
pos,Pos,one day ant dlo and kat will all be good in the same game one day
pos,Pos,get this bighorn sheep bitch outta here 7 21 1 10 from 3 and he takes the last shot you re not steph curry dlo
pos,Pos,chris paul is just too predictable in the fourth these days book was awesome in the fourth too star backcourt turned up when it mattered
pos,Pos,i think us suns and timberwolves fans can agree when i say fuck cheryl flores
pos,Pos,i would like to forget those 48 minutes
pos,Pos,i like games like this more than games where we get the shit kicked out of us
pos,Pos,absolutely take the clutch w on the back end of a back to back love the cp3 takeover and clutch book shots
neg,Neg,dlo really is book s favorite player
pos,Pos,when the ball fell into ant s hands at the end i was fully conceived he was about to hit a game winner
pos,Pos,if i were a wolves fan i d be so frustrated with dlo kat was on fire and dlo decided it was better to shoot contested fadeaways instead of getting the ball to kat
pos,Neg,why does the nba do road road back to backs do they hate their own product this game was disgusting not sure what s minnesota s excuse was though lol
pos,Pos,i am here patiently waiting for the pasta
neg,Neg,all the trade kat and build around ant boys please report to the comment section edit i love ant don t get me wrong
pos,Pos,i hate how dangelo plays at the end of games incredibly cosmically selfish
neg,Pos,defense was great
neg,Pos,what a weird ass game
neg,Pos,lmao what the hell was this game
neg,Neg,that s a tilter
pos,Pos,great 4th quarter from both teams glad to see book and paul clutch that one out
pos,Pos,surprisingly the wolves are only the 3rd most disappointing thing for me this month behind youtube removing dislikes gta remake sucking ass not sure how to feel bout that
pos,Pos,dlo shot the wolves out of this game poor kat he ain t winning with two selfish inefficient chuckers on his team they need to make moves if they want to keep kat
pos,Pos,did ant really tried to go for a 3 after that board but anyways gg wolves
pos,Pos,i d love to say good game but good god was it not sloppy basketball combined with whistle happy bad reffing made it a hard game to watch and not at all satisfying to win b2b or not this wasn t the win the suns wanted tonight
pos,Pos,dlo out there chucking in hopes of doing his signature ice in veins celebration
pos,Pos,swear to god that rim had a damn lid on it for both teams tonight
pos,Pos,i would like to thank the refs for their outstanding effort for helping us win the game
pos,Pos,lolwolves
neg,Neg,messy game inconsistent reffing couldn t shoot until the last half of the 4th gross basketball take the w and forget about this one kat was awesome and the wolves played good defense
pos,Pos,did ant think they were down 3
pos,Pos,i blame dlo
pos,Pos,bad fouls bad defence missed fts suns really tried their best to gift the wolves a win in the last couple mins
pos,Pos,i ve been selling low of dlo since he was a laker i can t understand how he s still a starter in this league he needs a reality check
pos,Pos,dlo is like a fucking puerile teenager
pos,Pos,congrats to edwards on your shaq tin a fool debut
pos,Pos,the warriors fleeced minnesota
pos,Pos,couldn t win this game without dlo
pos,Neg,dlo and ant suck lol
pos,Pos,classic lol wolves ending jaden the untouchable daniels with 4 points lmao
pos,Pos,damn y all really needed the refs to beat the timberwolves
neg,Neg,hey where are all the twolves fans who dogged me for saying y all won t win 30 am i still a stupid hater who wishes he lived in frozen hell
pos,Pos,sad
pos,Pos,pain
pos,Pos,great game sota had their chances and russell had a good look we know he has confidence but man i think he missed like the last 4 three pointers
neg,Neg,the twolves got some good chances but bad shots and turnovers cost them damn shame
pos,Pos,wolves in the cultch is had such bad shot selection
pos,Pos,i don t know how i keep supporting this stupid team but i do
pos,Pos,hey they moved marney to the studio very deserved i think
pos,Pos,wolves were up 5 and proceeded to shit the bed the rest of the way
neg,Neg,frank only getting 3 minutes damn
pos,Pos,didn t twolves hire their coach because he s supposed to know how to coach centers i feel like there have been so many games where you ask why the coach doesn t run a play for kat
pos,Neg,refs slowing the game to a crawl
pos,Neg,timberwolves just have a bunch of dudes that play like its the rec center they havent found the guy that makes sure everyone does what they need to do offensively and defensively and quite frank they dont have a so good that the team wins games they really gotta stop drafting guards
pos,Neg,missed this game but holy cow a lot of free throws this game refs calling everything
pos,Pos,free kat
pos,Pos,timberwolves could use a pg like ricky rubio
pos,Pos,this year the annual breakdown of wolves has happened rather quickly it feels so good to be free of rooting for such a shitty team cut your losses today wolves fans there are 28 other franchises
pos,Pos,wolves were doing well and pushing for a tough finish and they could ve even got a win but dlo started to chuck dumb shots and play hero ball dude needs to get a grip or he might end up being traded for the sake of the team s future you can t throw away opportunities like those he kept letting book go free and book would just torch them lethal midrange in the suns team
pos,Pos,kat s dropping 35 points and wolves are still losing classic
neg,Neg,i am really hoping we get something good when minnesota blows it all up
pos,Pos,good thing d lo did his pal booker a solid by playing absolutely terrible in the 4th just give the ball to kat we aren t here for you d lo
pos,Pos,kat overrated
neg,Neg,
neg,Pos,minnesota deserved to win
pos,Neg,yikes
pos,Pos,the highlight of this game for me was in the 4th when the camera cut to tyler and duncan talking about running a play for eachother the ball is inbounded tyler receives a pass and drives then kicks it out to duncan for the wide open 3 duncan was so hype about the communication it was dope as fuck to see tyler can absolutely be a leader if he needed to be guy is built to play ball
neg,Pos,crazy photo from tonight
pos,Pos,dead man and herro with a couple of 28s
pos,Pos,a double digit win on the road with no jimmy or bam
pos,Pos,y all call herro bubble boy i ain t forget that
pos,Pos,a game dominated by herro ball
pos,Pos,finishing the road trip with a w is always great tyler really stepped up during these games without jimmy having him as our sixth man is so great and it s lovely to see how he does when starting as well gg thunder your young ones have some major fight they ll be a problem real soon
pos,Pos,that 1st half defense by okc was legit they just couldn t stop herro and duncan in the 3rd quarter herro is 28 in 37 minutes too
pos,Pos,been great to watch herro backup his talk this past offseason 3 level scorer now
neg,Pos,happy to see duncan back at it
pos,Pos,nice defence by both teams it was great to watch can t really do much when herro is shooting like that and sga not shooting like that still a nice game tho for us
neg,Pos,dort is really starting to put it together offensively this was his 4th straight game of 20 points fucked
pos,Pos,tyler herro
pos,Pos,good team win and a good bounce back after a rough start on the westcoast roadtrip nice to see a great game without jimmy and bam
pos,Pos,sga had a problem tonight with some great defense by the heat tonight
pos,Pos,herro still ballin
pos,Pos,shai was terrible poku and jre showed hella flashes roby is our only actual big that takes it up strong nice night by baze dort fucking rocks thunder up
pos,Pos,herro could not be stopped dude was automatic from everywhere
pos,Pos,basketball
pos,Pos,that was one of the grossest games i ve seen in a while nice d on sga and good effort sans bam and jimmy
pos,Pos,damn dedmon 28 also
pos,Pos,d rob remembering how to play basketball at the perfect time god bless
neg,Pos,get dort some help for fucks sake
neg,Neg,gotta ask the okc fans is everything at the arena as terrible as it looks empty af up top foreigner lip sync a longs the half time show was a dude on a black light bike it s not really that bad is it
pos,Pos,these jerseys really blended together for me it was quite frustrating to watch especially on rebounds
pos,Pos,scottie still figuring out the late game he needs a go to move
neg,Pos,this will get overlooked but og went completely cold in the second half i think he shot 1 for 10
neg,Pos,losing sucks but barnes og gtj were good so whatever fun game
pos,Pos,scotties welcome to the league game although he still played solid cj is that guy ggs blazers but scottie will be back
pos,Pos,ruh roh we ve lost 2 straight road games now
pos,Neg,petition to play every game at home all in favor say aye
pos,Pos,fun game but a tough one to lose
pos,Pos,i am sad
pos,Pos,that block from cj into the dame three at the end didn t seal the game but holy shit it was hype
pos,Pos,we got some serious issues to figure out but will take the win
pos,Pos,gg portland og went cold barnes had a few costly turnovers dame and cj made us pay fun game to watch though miss norm
pos,Pos,that second half was the most fun i had watching a blazer game this season love that line up
neg,Pos,jeez the raptors schedule has some intense home road extremes they ve got 5 consecutive road games coming up before then playing 10 of their next 11 in toronto they play back to back on the road before another lot with 7 of 8 at home that s followed by 22 of 30 games on the road before their season finished with 8 of 9 in toronto after winning 5 straight games earlier this year they ve now lost 5 of 6 and i feel like we ll see them make similar runs all season long now
pos,Pos,larry nance jr had an underrated good game he was 7 7 even though a few of those were dunks
pos,Pos,scottie barnes ft is getting better
pos,Pos,cj with the non family friendly post game interview lol
pos,Pos,seemed like the blazers couldn t miss a shot from the 3rd quarter onwards barnes lillard had some fun little chirping going on barnes with a couple critical mistakes in the 4th gotta remember this guy s still a rookie despite how good he looks out there
pos,Pos,barnes with two costly turnovers down the stretch cj so far has been the blazers best player this season
pos,Pos,this scottie barnes is seriously good alongside og from a blazers fan
pos,Pos,all praise cj fuckin sorry bout that mccollum
pos,Pos,2nd half raps really fucking suck unfortunately
pos,Pos,tough last few minutes from barnes hope he holds his head high
neg,Pos,that was a wild fucking game it would ve been really bleak if we choked it away after that run in the fourth though so i m glad that we were able to tighten things up and close it out strong
pos,Pos,super fun game ngl i really wished we played like that against every other team lol every starter had double digits for once man i really wish fred can get an all star nomination this time around dude s been amazing but alas
pos,Pos,cj fuckin mccollum
pos,Neg,nassir little and larry nance to close it out love to see it
pos,Pos,cj just took the game over late went into point god mode hitting 3s with drive n kicks nance at smallball center opened things up
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,am i the only one who thinks birch must have the hands of a greasy toddler watching him fumble rebounds and easy catches is absurdly frustrating
neg,Neg,cj get way too much hate from casuals and some portland fans
pos,Pos,mccollum had a night nance and roco with some good defensive plays closer than i d hope but it s giving me faith that the blazers can turn it around once they ve built up some more chemistry with the squad and coaching staff
pos,Pos,game was over when scottie got blocked by cj
pos,Pos,back to tankathon s
neg,Pos,hey nurse how you gunna go to a rookie on the last two possessions when you have fred who was playing like a man possessed
pos,Neg,siakam walking out of that game a 5 thanks to fred and og hitting a gazillion threes but he was utter trash on defense tonight everybody beating him off the dribble and he s getting lazy on the closeouts can someone on the team remind him he s on a max contract
pos,Pos,if raps can stay around 500 until february they should be good for the rest of the season gives enough time for og and barnes to get consistent enough at scoring and then for the team to figure out their roles accordingly i love nurse that nurse commits to his lineups for better or for worse i think he has a winner this time from around february on they ll stop having ups and downs and just get better every game even through the playoffs
pos,Pos,hope the raptors trade siakam tbh give the keys to barnes and re tool
neg,Neg,raptors are losing a lot of close games it feels like
pos,Neg,feels like every team is having a great shooting night whenever it s against the raps portalnd shooting 56 and the worst shooting team in the league pistons acting like they are prime gsw
pos,Pos,og with 22 in the first half and only 7 points in the 2nd he shot well but i mean you cant just go cold like that
pos,Pos,raptors fan coming in peace that scottie brooks guy looks really spooky and fred van fleet can really shoot the ball
pos,Neg,zach lavine has never been over 500 for a stretch longer than 3 games before this season
pos,Pos,billy donovan is a really good coach bulls took davis out of the game tonight
neg,Neg,3 pointers made tonight lonzo 7 lavine 6 lakers 6
pos,Pos,god damn lonzo
pos,Pos,legm about to trade lebron to a contender
neg,Neg,caruso with the legendary 0 points 28
pos,Pos,deballzach s to the left
pos,Pos,bulls on pace for 59 wins
pos,Neg,deballzach popped off but also a great game from derrick jones jr aka the slim leaper
pos,Neg,
neg,Neg,demar for mvp
pos,Pos,lonzo ball s shooting fucking up the lakers feel like its 2017 all over again
pos,Pos,alex caruso is 2 0 in games he has started as a pf
pos,Pos,i haven t been this happy since 2011
pos,Pos,credit to billy donovan his lineups are weird as fuck and they re working
pos,Neg,demar continuing his mvp campaign
pos,Pos,only goats can get go 28 while scoring literally 0 points
pos,Pos,blowout bulls commentary is must watch tv
pos,Pos,lonzo and derozan show shot making was on another level tonight
pos,Neg,stephonzo out here looking like curry s son
pos,Pos,it s nice to be on other end of blowouts again
pos,Pos,
pos,Neg,tht and deandre jordan garbage time c0 mvps
neg,Pos,the eastern conference is so fun this year
pos,Pos,demar derozan
pos,Pos,i love deballzach
pos,Pos,in the words of r nba it was not as close as the score would indicate
pos,Neg,derozan and lavine are straight up untouchable the last couple of games
pos,Pos,my boy caruso was such a good guy imagine scoring 0 points and still defeating the lakers also imagine the lakers could have caruso and demar
pos,Pos,demvp
neg,Pos,lonzo is an elite guard in the league and nobody can tell me otherwise
pos,Pos,the rdcworld vids were getting this season is gonna be amazing
pos,Pos,deballzach with 91 tonight scary
pos,Neg,demar derozan
neg,Pos,you just lost to deballzach
pos,Pos,demar and zach should both make the all star teams at this rate literally starting backcourt lmao
pos,Pos,it s about that time we aint playin no more big boi stuff only last night all the hard work payin off all my fans family appreciate y all thank you for taking the journey wit me and uh you know hopefully we can move on from here and everybody have a good time and i get in the league and do what i was supposed to do thank y all wooooooooooo
pos,Pos,deballzac combine for 91 and caruso despite the 0 points had a second best of 28 this team is going deep into the playoffs
pos,Pos,kent bazemore has to be the worst player getting consistent rotation minutes in the nba mans is stinky tier on both ends of the court
pos,Neg,i m ready for a miami bulls matchup up already bring it back to 2011
pos,Pos,insane how good our chemistry is so early on we got something special here
pos,Neg,east is going to be a bloodbath comes playoff time
neg,Pos,not mad we lost bulls are legit made me actually happy seeing lonzo go off
neg,Neg,i think spurs fans tried to warn people that derozan is actually good but everybody insisted it was the worst free agent signing in recorded history
pos,Pos,caruso 0 points 1 shot attempt 28 lebron tweeting him during the game it was just a normal night for alex caruso
pos,Pos,congrats to caruso for getting his ass off a sinking ship and onto a winner
neg,Pos,what got me was ad may have been unfairly ejected but what gives lebron the right to get on the court in protest that s just bullshit
pos,Pos,only thing that would make this night better for the lakers haters would be if caruso popped off instead of tht lol
neg,Pos,dragged our deballzach all over southern california
pos,Pos,so much hot sauce tonight demar once again proving everyone who doubted his signing with us was stupid lonzo lighting it up from 3 with 7 10 zach just doing zach things caruso with the typical cookie monster lockdown defense
pos,Pos,lakers and clippers the back to back to beware rarely have the two los angeles n b a teams been good at the same time now they are both great and visiting opponents are struggling deballzach hold my beer
pos,Pos,tell me again about how the bulls haven t been playing anyone
pos,Pos,good game lakers tht impressed me tonight first time i ve really focused on him in a game while it was a career night for him i can see why at 20 years old he would be chosen as an asset over caruso definitely not unreasonable like many are making it out to be the one issue is that most of the lakers are old as hell and caruso would definitely help in the win a chip in the next 3 years goal maybe they re prioritizing someone that can be another offensive threat and floor spacer with lebron always out til the playoffs and russ being a brick layer he dropped 17 last game too do you guys think he s gonna be at least a 13 15 ppg threat this season how you feel about him as a prospect overall
pos,Pos,the one thought that came to my mind tonight is that the lakers missed on ball caruso and demar this season lol
pos,Pos,talen is the best garbage time player i ve ever seen edit and bazemore is the worst wtf was he doing out there
pos,Pos,demar could unironically be an mvp candidate this year
neg,Pos,everybody get in here
neg,Neg,demar get that chip
pos,Pos,lakers 31 fta to bulls 11 refs couldn t even make it close
pos,Pos,lonzo with 7 10 on 3s holy shit
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,hahaha this sucks man
pos,Neg,zach literally had an off game what the fuck
pos,Neg,lonzo is the perfect pg for a contending team improved his 3pt can pass and play d
pos,Pos,thank you bulls yesterdays loss feels much better now
pos,Pos,the bulls are checks notes back
pos,Neg,man i love this new bulls team fuck garpax
pos,Pos,tht tryharding in garbage time to make the score respectable
neg,Neg,destroyed delakers
pos,Pos,fuck sake this game was so painful to watch from the lakers side buuuuuuttttt the bulls were fukn lit
pos,Pos,hey lakers fans how are yall feeling with bazemore s two points and 5 fouls
pos,Pos,im happy for bulls fans
pos,Pos,at least tht looked good lol
pos,Pos,this version of zo is what the lakers wanted him to be like
neg,Pos,lakers had 20 more free throws and still lost by 20 yikes
pos,Pos,current lakers vibe rn winless preasons slow start injured star all that s left is for vogel to get fired mid season
pos,Neg,lakers should never wear those ugly ass jerseys ever again ahaha
pos,Neg,
neg,Pos,lonzo saw red today
pos,Neg,lakers coaches giving out encouragement after the game
pos,Pos,bulls should start load managing lavine so his injury doesn t get worse
pos,Pos,demarvelous derozan
pos,Neg,so do lakers hate third quarters or do third quarters hate lakers it has to be mutual at this point
pos,Pos,more true than ever
pos,Pos,i feel like lebron is milking this injury for a potential storyline the worse the lakers look now the better the story i guess we ll see how it works out for him
pos,Pos,i ll be honest i thought the bulls were gonna be just a mid playoff team but they beat the lakers and clippers back to back pretty easily this team is scary
neg,Neg,this year is pretty sick i love seeing bulls taken seriously again
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,has lakers beaten any real playoff team this season they struggled against bad teams like spurs okc and houston im not surprised they getting assblasted by playoff teams
pos,Pos,so good to see lonzo balling out on the bulls
neg,Neg,always a fun day when the lakers play a team with a record better than a batting average
pos,Pos,all i can say is holy smokes
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,i know tht is a meme but he s actually pretty good lol i can see why the lakers value him he has a loooot of potential seriously
pos,Pos,no lebron fine but also no vuc or pat williams and this was in la with the bulls having played 3 in 4
pos,Pos,gonna be honest if demar is gonna shoot 80 on contested mid range fadeaways and lavine and lonzo are gonna shoot 70 on contested 3s the bulls might just have a chance of making the playoffs
neg,Neg,tht the king of garbage time
neg,Neg,ayoshowdeballzac
neg,Neg,don t be fooled by the score wasn t that close of a game
neg,Pos,me as a lakers fan this season
pos,Neg,3 ball is our downfall both shooting and defending
pos,Pos,derozan had a game but lonzo s play out this game away
neg,Neg,this bulls team is really good it ll be nice to see us play again fully healthy on both sides
pos,Pos,the lakers are a mess bulls look legit
pos,Neg,i just pray this team stays healthy
pos,Pos,i m so god damn happy for zo he tore it up tonight i hope the bulls meet with the 76ers in the playoffs and he puts a beating on them for talking shit when he got drafted
neg,Pos,loss angeles
pos,Pos,the bulls are a problem but the lakers also suck
pos,Pos,did davis really only attempt 9 field goals excluding fouls ad has to be one of the most disappointing players like take this team on your back i reckon lbj is very disappointed ad has shown to be unable to be the man he probs though by this time ad would have taken control of the team
pos,Pos,zo woke up and choose violence but on the serious note imagine if he was still lakers pg and not russ not trying to say russ is bad but considering how lonzo improved his shooting and don t get me started with decision making which compared to russ is way better he would be a better fit rn but
pos,Pos,pretty bad when you take 20 more free throws than the other team and still lose by 20
neg,Pos,lakers are so small with bron and ariza out on the back line when a big goes out on a pnr it s a bunch of 6 3 6 4 guys you really noticed it on those derrick jones jr rolls to the rim where 6 6 djj is just towering over rondo or bazemore who are helping tht looks good
pos,Pos,michael jordan s deal with adam silver consists of his hornets and bulls playing in the ecf then the winner defeats the lakers in the finals adding another l to lllllllebron s career
neg,Pos,best los angeles team featuring derozan lavine lonzo and caruso
pos,Pos,la superteams got smoked tonight
neg,Pos,lakers really just played their best basketball of the season against us and then this happens lol where was monk s shooting at
pos,Pos,lonzo had his fill of that legendary chicago hot sauce today
neg,Pos,actual steph curry with a 40in vertical
pos,Pos,warriors spanked the bulls who just beat both la teams wtf bulls
neg,Neg,tht learning from westbrook
pos,Pos,gimme the hot sauce
pos,Pos,lonzo is an all star period bulls this year look amazing it s really fun watch their games de rozan is too good
pos,Pos,i don t want to see bazemore defending anyone ever again
pos,Neg,lonzo made more threes than the lakers as a team lol
neg,Pos,i m not a basketball guru or anything but if you re getting constantly triple teamed then that means there s at least two other guys with no defenders that can take the ball and easily score
pos,Pos,ayo show deballzach
pos,Pos,caruso had 0 points but was 28
pos,Pos,westbrook 0 6 from the 3 point line bro what are you doing meaning he was 8 13 from everywhere else 62 isn t bad for 2 pointers but dude just throws up 3s like he s steph curry
pos,Pos,for the lakers it s almost like a group of old guys vs a group of young ones
pos,Pos,i swear people forgot demar averaged 27ppg just because he was looking for his shot less with pop and asked to do other things with his game best footwork in the nba
neg,Neg,shit was personal for lonzo
pos,Pos,on to the next one
neg,Neg,caruso being 28 against the lakers you fucking love to see it
pos,Pos,super clutch 14 4 run by the nets to avoid losing by 20
pos,Pos,that was a home game for the warriors tough scene
neg,Neg,barclays cheered more for curry than kd
pos,Pos,gpii coming off the bench is like when a cop lets the k9 out of the back seat
pos,Pos,barkey no one has appreciated steph curry in a very long time it s been years kenny i said he was the best player two days ago charles no you didn t
pos,Pos,impressive but when will the warriors play against the 92 dream team
pos,Pos,the manning curse is broken
neg,Pos,breaking news kd spotted in front of kyrie s home carrying chloroform and a vaccine shot
pos,Pos,key to this game was kyrie and andrew shot selection
neg,Neg,kd played that 3rd quarter like he s a fucking laker
pos,Pos,wiggins and kuminga i thank the heavens everyday for that d lo trade
pos,Neg,
pos,Pos,i ve seen enough you get klay back and have kuminga develop into a solid rookie contributor and the warriors are clear title favorites they remind me so much of the pre kd warriors 110 on defense from everybody great ball movement a bunch of guys outside of curry who can knock down shots just an absolute joy to watch as a neutral bball fan those 2014 16 warriors set the standard for me for what great team basketball looks like they re right back at that level right now they just smoked a healthy albeit kyrie less nets team on the road
neg,Neg,
pos,Pos,a lot of people are going to look at the offensive numbers and rightfully so considering curry dropped 37 on 19 shots including 9 14 from three but the reality is that the tonight s win was because of their defense draymond was yelling at everyone motivating them to do their job maintain their vigilant hands in passing lanes ensure attention to detail and contest virtually every shot the nets put up in doing so the warriors held durant to a 6 for 19 dismal shooting night yielding a season low 19 points and displayed their 3 rd quarter ability yet again stretching a lead at the half from 7 to 22 by the end of the quarter half accomplished with curry on the bench after his 4 th foul and causing durant to miss all of his shots in the quarter
neg,Neg,thoughts the warriors defense is incredible steph curry needs to freeze himself and defrost in 100 years so he can play against robots and aliens because that s his competition the nets need a big man whose a lob threat to open up harden s p r game the tnt commentary has improved greatly since the marv chris webber calls
pos,Pos,imagine playing so good that in the home court of 2 present and playing generational talents the crowd still cheered for the visitor and this isn t a superstar on a retirement tour
pos,Pos,a team vs a collection of good players
pos,Pos,kyrie really just chilling at home figuring out what next bullshit to post on his ig while watching his team get absolutely dismantled by steph that rough
pos,Neg,is it 2015 again
neg,Neg,i m really proud of wiggins in his last few games and i can t believe i am saying that he s playing less iso and more team ball and it is making the team even better the defense is incredible too
pos,Pos,for a guy who was a offensive system in himself nash offense for the nets is atrocious theres no movement off ball guys just holding corners its houston 2 0 minus the spacing
pos,Pos,kd firing up them burners as we speak
pos,Pos,curry feels like an anime protagonist só unfair how he hits shot after shot i feel blessed to see this man play also he had more than half of the team s 3s
pos,Pos,you know dray just whispered hey bud you can jump on the bus back home with us
neg,Neg,3rd quarter warriors are back and the nets have no bench without harris
pos,Pos,
neg,Neg,stephen curry is leading the mvp race
pos,Pos,the nets were without kyrie and also kd for the whole 2nd half so can t wait till we win against a good team now seriously holy fuck this was beyond my wildest start of season expectations what a team we have will never get tired of watching steph do his thing my mvp
neg,Pos,the 49ers dump on the rams last night and the warriors eviscerate the nets tonight it s gonna get really really smug in the bay area for a few days lmao since i don t have anywhere to post this where it ll get traction i ll just edit this comment the warriors outside of steph curry shot 4 26 from three every single one of those makes was shot over kevin durant do with that what you will
pos,Neg,all those ex western conference players from okc clippers and spurs now at the same team got the flashback nightmare from steph and the warriors lmao edit yea ofc rockets
neg,Neg,wwwwlwwwwwwwlwarriors
neg,Neg,warriors depth was on full display tonight they run 12 deep compared toe brk s 8 man rotation for most of the game they got a bit desperate toward the end of the 3rd and put in lma and thomas warriors may not have a lot of interior size but their wings are fucking big wiggins iguodala opj kuminga all run 6 7 6 9 leads to them being a much better rebounding team on both sides than expected kerr s such an underrated coach mans been slandered too long coty frontrunner at this point i think he uses the 1st half to experiment around and figure out whats working what isnt to use for the 2nd half steph was absolutely locked in from minute 1 automatic from three this game his best performance of the season imo dray was player of the game for me his defense on kd was fucking sublime disrupted so many actions organized the defense so well dude needs to be in dpoy frontrunner rn kuminga is a man so much more nba ready than the scouting report would suggest love his individual defense and general awareness kd had an off game but the warriors defended him really goddamn well smartly timed blitz s double lots of pre switching to deny mismatches on the kd harden pnr and individual brilliance from draymond iguodala and wiggins lma is unplayable against the warriors he just get pnr d to death nash tried it out in the 3rd when steph sat with 4 fouls and it did not work then they left in to start the 4th and steph cooked his ass on switches harden might actually be the worst perimeter defender in the nba the amount of times he gets blown by caught flat footed is staggering for a professional basketball player brk s inability to take advantage of steph having to sit with 4 fouls was inexcusable you have too cut into the lead when the other teams best player is out full stop brk offense when kd sits is just grinds too a halt too much harden iso with 4 out looks much better when the balls out of hardens hands but that requires him too play offball which he wont do brk complains for fouls too damn much like literally after every other play not a good look longterm refs were utter and complete garbage shoot them into deep space pls
pos,Pos,but kyrie didn t play let s wait til everyone comes back including vince carter and the 2002 nets roster before admitting the warriors are legit
neg,Neg,this win should def silence the haters no way they say brooklyn is a bad team
pos,Pos,sometimes i wish i was the sky
pos,Pos,wiggins carried the second quarter when we needed something to go and then curry just went in for the kill
pos,Pos,igoudala saved us from the death beam during that 3rd quarter buzzer beater in front of kd as well
pos,Pos,wiggins was amazing and gave room to play freely
neg,Neg,kyrieeeeee you watching this wiggins got the vax and hes splashing 3s over me you better get jabbed or im gone i better not lose to the warriors again my legacy kyrieeee
neg,Pos,warriors are overrated such a weak schedule call me when the warriors beat someone good like the warriors
pos,Pos,you know kd was salty af watching his own crowd hype up steph curry
pos,Pos,welcome to the fucking show
neg,Neg,pffttt easy schedule im waiting till they face a real team like the 98 bulls
pos,Neg,i have personally said it in the past stephen curry is the most underrated legend the last 15 years in the nba regardless of tonights game he has revolutionized the nba with his 3p which even by nba standards its absurd his efficiency play making bball controul is one of a kind i dont get how people even compare him to irving steph is above him and its not close imho he is better than durant aswell people keep messing up flashiness with efficiency and winning basketball he is 33 years old sticked with his team and the only reason we propably havent witnessed the best dynasty basketball has ever seen its injuries and these are not what if injuries we know what klay and steph can do together he is above kd as far as i am concerned and it will be extra juicy to see what unfolds after kd s latest likes on some tweets
pos,Neg,welcome to the show calling it now warriors winning it all this year defense and a top 5 offense it s over
pos,Pos,nets not a real team only real teams in the nba are memphis and charlotte when they re at home
neg,Pos,teams trying to build something to beat la but forgot to build teams to stop curry
neg,Pos,real mvp is wiggs for getting vaxxed fuck kyrie
neg,Neg,nets not a legit team confirmed
neg,Neg,even nets fans were cheering for steph to shoot lol and got mvp chants
pos,Pos,key takeaways warriors may actually be better on defense than offense yikes run hide 3rd quarter dubs are coming if you run iso against the warriors you re done the help defense and rotations are great deepest team in the league everyone plays and we re down two starters another yikes i need to see d lee knock down a 3 soon or i m going to start thinking bad thoughts durant looked slow tonight don t know what s up there but i d expect a better performance next time curry on the inside track for mvp and it s not that close blake griffin has to figure something out offensively starting be a big liability
neg,Neg,name a player who gets mvp chant when they beating your ass at home
pos,Pos,that was fun i m a watch it again
neg,Pos,close one we almost didn t hold them under 100 to maintain our defensive rating
pos,Pos,forgetting all the other games warriors played already this is a statement game curry nearly 40 on 63 64 100 has sent the message
pos,Pos,you can say so much about the warriors but watching the full game after watching some other contenders play over the last couple of weeks one thing stands out the culture mid game is just different when someone gets beat someone is always running over to help even if it is futile or they are not even close the nets had sooo few easy buckets until garbage time because the warriors not only have speed but they swarm people constantly even with a little less speed their defense would be great because everyone is hungry the new foul rules reward this mindset even more than before and the warriors take that defensive energy and translate it into a hungry offense they will give up some 4th quarter leads playing so hungry but they will blow people out a lot they are having fun blowing people out and that is a scary thing i get so tired of watching someone on the lakers get beat and the team lets it become an easy bucket the warriors are frantic wild and battling still not convinced they are for sure contenders but they are gonna have a great regular season
neg,Pos,steph mvp
pos,Pos,aaaaand it wasn t even that close
pos,Pos,steph mvp draymond dpoy kerr coty what year is this lmao warriors look great
pos,Pos,kd in the parking lot texting draymond rn
pos,Pos,this warriors team is the gold standard gritty defense and their offense is beautiful to watch with the off ball movement unselfish play and split actions i hope westbrick watched the game so he can take notes on how to play without the ball or even to set up an offense
neg,Neg,my condolences to the nets whose status has been changed from contender to team that doesnt count after tonight loss
pos,Pos,i prefer that they won this one vs winning the hornets game and losing this one
pos,Neg,just wait till they play an actual good team
pos,Pos,yes the warriors beat the nets and yes the grizzlies beat the warriors but guess which team has beaten the nets warriors and grizzlies hornets winning it all confirmed
pos,Pos,this isn t real until they beat the cavs on thursday then it will be this isn t real until they be the pistons and so on and so on
pos,Pos,unanimous on the way
neg,Pos,steph is the most universally loved nba player theres not many haters that you can find theres people who hate the warriors mostly cuz kd but everyone respects steph it was a damn home game
pos,Pos,so are we good now
pos,Pos,nuggets can try to speak joker mvp into existence all they want steph is coming for the mvp
pos,Neg,but who have they played
pos,Neg,warriors destroyed us and that too on our own turf ggs shit ton of things to work on nets can learn more from rewatching this game s tape than that from all the other games so far combined looking forward to the next match up ps curry
neg,Neg,shoutout to draymond for his d on durant of all people able of defending kd there s only a handful i d trust the job to try to contain this behemoth green one of them
pos,Pos,you warriors are good real good
pos,Pos,kd chose the wrong ny fan base mvp chants for steph in his arena lmao
pos,Pos,curry make my pp big
neg,Pos,hater warriors had an easy schedule and can only beat bad teams warriors beat both la teams blow out the red hot bulls blow out the former ecf team and blow out the nets at home hater yeah but they still can t contend without klay warriors literally already contending without klay hater whatever bro
pos,Pos,nov 16 but the dubs aren t looking like anyone can stop them
neg,Pos,who s beating the warriors in a 7 game series
pos,Pos,lmao shaq finishing the interview steph chuck beat kenny to the board tonight lmao these fucking guys
neg,Neg,i feel no sympathy towards the nets with kyrie oh boo hoo your third all star isn t playing they have 2 mvps and they have the balls to complain about needing more talent
pos,Pos,steph to kd they don t love you like that seriously if steph isn t the mvp right now he s definitely the most celebrated he got cheers and yells when he touched the ball at the arena where the best player in the nba plays
pos,Pos,lmfao at kd leaving the warriors over recognition because of steph only to lose to the warriors in a blowout with steph getting mvp chants in his own building damn that s gotta sting
pos,Pos,curry played like he wanted to send a little message to durant so did green mainly our team is so far ahead in basketball iq cohesiveness we re going to make you sit and watch in the 4th quarter damn
pos,Pos,you know what s more amazing steph s also the leading rebounder tied of the game what the heck steph
neg,Neg,steph might make an all defensive team if he keeps it up
pos,Pos,the decline of draymond green has been greatly exaggerated
pos,Pos,why didn t this get posted after the 3rd quarter when the game ended
pos,Pos,skyfucker mvp
neg,Neg,warriors swarming defense is just suffocating you love to see it
pos,Pos,would be interested to hear from someone who was at the game but it sounded like there were way more gs fans than brooklyn fans in the building which seems weird to me
pos,Pos,five minutes left in the 4th warriors are up by 100 and steph was out there doing trick shots for the crowd after the whistle curry is ona mission to remind the world exactly how good he and the warriors are
pos,Pos,is the bad man curry gone
pos,Pos,stephen a smith is going to bust a nut on first take tomorrow
neg,Neg,is it just me or is wiggins now starting to realize his potential
pos,Pos,on this day kd received a grim reminder the 3rd quarter warriors exist
neg,Neg,hopefully our schedule balances out soon and we start playing some good teams record looking so inflated farming these trash scrubs
pos,Neg,christ the nets just fall over with the lightest breeze
pos,Pos,draymond got spicy with not 10 but 11 points this game
neg,Pos,in as highly a hyped up november nba regulation game as i can remember steph gave it to kd raw
pos,Pos,i was totally wrong about this year s warriors holy shit lmao
pos,Pos,i d forgotten what it was like to see threes go into the basket
pos,Pos,yo what the fuck is the username of the guy that posted this thread lmao
pos,Pos,the sixers are going to get eviscerated on this road trip
pos,Pos,i don t think much of this game apart from covid and injuries suck last few years when we ve had both squads go at it full strength they ve been such fun to watch it s a shame to see them come so hobbled hope you get your guys back please look after our minivan
pos,Neg,the fact that we got dok minutes says about all you need to know about this game
pos,Pos,dear god embiid please
neg,Pos,what kinda fuckin username is that op
neg,Neg,maxey is the only good thing going for this team rn and he doesn t get the ball nearly as much as he should
pos,Pos,the home games against the sixers have been some of my favorite games to watch in past years this game was disappointing i m glad we finally played a complete game though
pos,Pos,bojan
neg,Pos,weren t the 76ers like 8 1 a minute ago they starting to act like us
pos,Pos,not much the sixers could have done down 4 starters
neg,Neg,this was not a good win but i m glad it wasn t an embarrassing loss
pos,Pos,mr morey please get that trade in as soon as possible
pos,Pos,basketball was played today
pos,Pos,sixers you re gunna take cj and you re gunna like it
pos,Pos,wow even in our good games joe s shooting didn t show up he s been so so cold from 3 lately
pos,Pos,moreys ego caused him to ask sky high for simmons offer now embiid is injured they are slipping games and he overplayed his hand they could have had a pretty good offer and moved on from him now embiid is probably getting more frustrated and will probably looking for a trade himself when they get bounced in the 2nd round great moves morey saw the whole thing first hand with kawhi once the player is checked out it never works out
neg,Pos,if i know one thing it s that the 79s love scoring 19 points in a quarter
pos,Pos,i thought for sure we d make a fool of ourselves against an undermanned team on national tv at home
pos,Pos,damn this thread on page 3 i thought it wasn t posted lol definitely a game deserving though
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,reggie has more of a greenlight than pg does
neg,Neg,and his name paul fucking george
neg,Pos,this clippers are bout be a top 4 seed without their top 5 player in the world for him to potentially come back and wreck the west for everybody else
pos,Neg,brandon boston jr is gonna be something y all
pos,Pos,tonight s highlight
pos,Pos,roller coaster reggie aka big government aka bobby shmurda at it again
pos,Pos,brandon boston jr
pos,Pos,our bench was awful this game i don t think lonnie will be on the spurs next year wish we kept it closer but it s not really the fault of anyone that matters other than vassell we got destroyed when pop played that tre jones bryn forbes lonnie walker devin vassell drew eubanks lineup which isn t surprising at all really
neg,Pos,don t look now but the pg clippers are tied for top 4 in the west
pos,Pos,that was a game
pos,Pos,dj didnt get his triple double day ruined
neg,Neg,fucking turnovers this would have been a 30pt blowout loss against the warriors or nets
pos,Pos,clippers get the last win at staples center
neg,Pos,dejounte is so good
neg,Neg,i m just here to simp for dejounte murray i counted another triple double but the stats disagree triple double in my heart
pos,Pos,really missing poeltl he is probably our 2nd or 3rd best player this season outside of dejounte
pos,Pos,murray s be killing the clippers
pos,Pos,time to start a new streak
pos,Pos,i m glad dejounte is finally busting out i ve been waiting 2 years for him to come into his own love how he plays the game
pos,Pos,can someone tell me what happened to batum
pos,Pos,the clippers kept turning it over and giving the spurs a chance to get back in it but no one could score gg clips
neg,Pos,dejounte is so nice
neg,Pos,lets go cliyuuups new w streak starts now
neg,Neg,dejounte murray is the next breakout all star like zach lavine spurs roster is garbage tho
pos,Pos,apologies in advanced to spurs fans but did it hurt seeing kawhi at the sideline with his team awful game both teams deserve an l for this how do you let that many turnovers to happen and how do spurs lose to a team with that many turnovers bj looked good once he settled in
neg,Pos,that s gotta be one of the worst looking 14 point victories i ve ever seen lol
pos,Pos,clippers are playing great basketball and the team chemistry looks great just like gsw they were underrated this season without kawhi but they have got impressive wins so far in this season in the west and so far this season lac and gsw are looking the team that can probably contest in final the scary thing is both teams looks like will get better as the season progresses barring any major injuries
pos,Neg,i love how when we win less than 100 comments
pos,Neg,well that could have gone better
neg,Neg,how many close games have there been this season seems really down on last year
neg,Pos,random question but does anyone know what shoes bryn forbes was wearing during this game edit he s at 1 44 if anyone wants to take a look
pos,Pos,has any team had a harder schedule than the spurs
pos,Pos,anyone know why mann didn t play
neg,Pos,dejounte s ready to play on a contender
pos,Pos,the wizards shooting an abysmal 19 1 from 3 point range going from 8 42 won us this game sheesh edit also 36 second half points would do it to you
neg,Neg,idk folks maybe hiring the dude who was gm of the lakers from 2000 2017 was an okay move after all
pos,Pos,when the shot wasn t falling tonight lamelo found a way to impact the game elsewhere wit them 14 assists and 2 steals i like this guy he s a trooper
pos,Pos,anyone else hear eric collins say spencer dinwiddie was playing like spencer hawes
pos,Neg,look at cody martin man so inspirational
neg,Pos,hornets coach deserves some credit for the turnaround that this team has had
neg,Pos,beat the top teams of each conference we legit
neg,Neg,lamelo with 14 assists
pos,Pos,i have no idea why we kept shooting 3s in the 3rd quarter
pos,Pos,so we beat both conference leaders in the space of 3 days so we are the best team in the league yes
pos,Pos,commentator on our post game show just said bridges is so locked in with melo he s the fourth ball brother lamiles
pos,Pos,the wizards shooting had me feeling sorry for them except not really
pos,Pos,damn the hornets just beat the top two teams in each conference in back to back games
neg,Neg,small ball hornets in the 3rd quarter was basically a mix of showtime lakers and 96 bulls
pos,Pos,i don t think many teams will win shooting 8 42 from three gg hornets definitely my fav non wizard team
pos,Pos,this reminded me of the time we scored 6 points against the hornets in the 4th quarter
pos,Pos,coach borrego alright it s time for our super secret end of game kill shot play players what is that again coach literally just set a pick for terry and he ll do the rest proceeds to work every single game
pos,Neg,we should be the 1 seed in both conferences if we re being honest
pos,Pos,buzz buzz
pos,Pos,what is r nba gonna talk about when russ plays well and the wizards lose
pos,Pos,not a pleasant watch
neg,Pos,missed rui in this game clearly one of the worst outside shooting performances i have ever seen from us lmao
pos,Pos,buzz buzz
neg,Pos,is charlotte an elite defensive team now what is this xd
pos,Pos,the warriors also shot badly against the hornets maybe it s just a coincidence
neg,Pos,lamelo becoming the best pg in the league dont me
neg,Pos,ecf preview
neg,Neg,i think lamelo might be the second best passer in the league behind jokic his assists are resulting in easy buckets for his team they re high quality passes and not the typical volume assists
neg,Neg,i haven t had that much fun watching a team for a long time
neg,Neg,did hornets owner subs in lol
neg,Neg,did the warriors and wizards really have bad shooting nights or was is charlotte s lock down perimeter defense
pos,Pos,seeing all this movement on offense reminds me of the glorious days of the previous two weeks of sixers basketball before tobias harris ripped them out of my cold dead hands
pos,Pos,pathetic offensive effort all around if we had hit even a normal amount of 3s this game was ours easy
neg,Pos,i can t remember the last time the wizards had a team that could consistently shoot 3s
neg,Pos,brick house game right here
pos,Pos,interesting result for our division going to be an interesting game tomorrow wizards
neg,Neg,wtf was dinwiddie doing
pos,Neg,abra ka bonk
pos,Pos,charlotte didn t beat us tonight but that perimeter mvp of the game
pos,Pos,wiz faced a team better than 500 and stuggled tonight
pos,Pos,we lost this game why did we keep shooting threes made no sense lol
pos,Pos,ah to the couch it is
neg,Neg,i know it is said every pistons win but cade just has it down the stretch in a 1 possesion game against a decent team i don t remember the full sequence but cade drained a turnaround midrange dime for 3 layup another really good drive and dish for 3 where he floated in the air and read the defender on the perimiter then there was the timeout cade got a big rebound or 2 and continued to just facilitate and run the offense like a pro dude is just so smooth and calm and collected it also helps when his teamates are finally hitting open shots lol
pos,Pos,alarming to see how important cory joseph can be to a team in 2021
pos,Neg,i love that we re managing a tank even though we ve made like 0 roster moves in 3 years
pos,Pos,i want to emphasize starting here because he s been injured the vast majority of his tenure with us and has a new coach who s clearly installing a new system that said i m starting to think caris is just an inefficient chucker dude looked only for his own offense second half and denied sabonis the ball when he had good position over and over and seemed only to pass it to someone else once his lane was cut off
neg,Pos,cade as a career shooter is a good 3 point maker it s only a matter of time before he becomes more efficient his form is very solid i just think sometimes he needs a slightly higher release point but everything else about his game just screams star
pos,Pos,fire sale time trade everyone for young players and rebuild
pos,Pos,pacers fell off
neg,Pos,when cade gets that shot going he is going to be an absolute menace dude has everything but that knockdown three it seems
pos,Pos,18 points for cory cojo saw the fanbase talking about him and took it personally
neg,Pos,why did sabonis take 7 shots while brogdon took 18 that seems not like a thing you want
pos,Pos,every week there s a pacers should blow it up post on this sub and every time there s a bunch of pacers fans in the replies talking about how they don t want to see a rebuild and are happy with the team as is the bar for ya ll must be in hell if this is the team you re happy to watch lol
pos,Pos,i hate when my parlay loses so early in the evening
neg,Neg,rick carlisle washed
pos,Pos,stop winning we need one more high lottery pick in all seriousness happy the pistons got some buzz it s so rough out here for detroit sports
pos,Pos,just wait
pos,Pos,god i wish the pistons could shoot average from three
pos,Pos,myles turner is ass
pos,Pos,we look better with kev as a starter also cam reddish is an enigma he s either awful or great tonight he was great
pos,Pos,celtics are so weird tatum drops 34 on good efficiency and 4 other celtics score in double figures still lose by double digits
neg,Neg,the doubles on trae arent gonna work he s too good at still drawing up the right play the rest of our team is actually good and can score
pos,Neg,kvon needs 30min every night
neg,Neg,reports of atlanta s demise may have been premature
pos,Pos,first efficient scoring game from tatum in a week and a half and we lose by 11 our overall offense just doesn t have enough firepower with any parts missing
pos,Neg,it s all coming together
pos,Pos,tatum finally shows up and everyone else stays home god damn this team is frustrating
pos,Pos,cam fam me included after finally getting an efficient game from him with great defense
pos,Pos,here i go again rolling the clip love that we won even with a less than stellar game from trae and a good game from tatum strength we back baybeeeee
pos,Pos,we need shooters badly
neg,Neg,the baptist with a 20
neg,Neg,kev is balling
pos,Pos,hawks fans how has gallinari been this year on paper such a nice depth piece but not sure if the injuries are just slowing him down would he still have a major role on the team come playoff time if not seems like he d be a great trade piece since he could match 20 mill in salary and the receiving team could erase some salary commitment with his non guarantee next year
pos,Pos,our bench just isn t good enough for us to win without 2 starters
pos,Pos,the trae young and john collins duo is a menace to fantasy basketball
pos,Pos,my takeaway tacko has that insurance ad money
pos,Neg,we suck so bad bruh
neg,Neg,i m not sure there are 10 teams in the east we are better than
pos,Pos,boston basically dared the team outside of trae to be well nba players tonight didn t work out that was pretty much the strategy in the playoffs guaranteed 10 assists for trae and if he starts hitting the tough 3s that he bricked tonight while you play aggressive defense you can basically say goodnight they did a really good job on him and outside of 1 or 2 three balls they were all contested also forced him into some wtf passes no disrespect intended truly but i ll never understand why marcus smart is as revered as he is league wide it s not like his stat sheet was horrendous but all of the actual defensive work was done by schroeder and horford while marcus let all 3 of our wings get hot at different points in the game which was the actual back breaker considering how well the trae was defended
pos,Pos,you love to see it
neg,Pos,obligatory fuck the celtics
neg,Pos,here s a fun fact for the celtics you are actually allowed to shoot from three when you re open
neg,Neg,this celtics squad is a bunch of losers absolutely no heart
pos,Pos,why is the basketball schedule following the nfl schedule for boston teams not complaining just think it is amusing
pos,Pos,hawks are back
pos,Pos,payton pritchard getting benched until garbage time against trae young makes no sense to me ime has some splainin to do this is a matchup that he literally has size advantage the only really good player in the league he can say that about fvv also the same height but wider edit also john collins and cam reddish are dudes grant williams and josh richardson are just kinda dudes
pos,Pos,marcus smart about to do something crazy
neg,Pos,remember when c s fans were talking up langford and nesmith as non busts and how much of a late in the round steal payton pritchard was
pos,Pos,missing 2 of your best 3 players with a team without too much depth going against a playoff quality team usually won t turn out too well
pos,Pos,hotlanta
neg,Neg,just two bottom feeding teams battling for a play in spot
neg,Neg,hawks tonight falcons tomorrow atlanta owns boston
neg,Neg,lesson learned we are not a good team without jaylen brown and rob williams also our bench sucks but what else is new
neg,Pos,really can t expect to win if only 6 guys score
pos,Pos,celtics only had 6 guys score this game if that doesn t show their lack of depth then idk what does
pos,Neg,hawks are as good as they are going to get celtics missing two starters one who is an all star hawks shot over 50 percent and that was the difference otherwise stats very similar for both teams both teams could be bounced in first round
pos,Pos,patty mills low key is leading in a lot of these games for nets
neg,Neg,gonna be a long 2 weeks for cavs fans at least it s coming for hard games so hopefully we can take advantage of a full team against the weaker teams in the league
pos,Pos,we played horribly against a decimated cavs team credit to the cavs for fighting back but it should not have gotten to that point
pos,Pos,with half the team dead and ed davis playing 24 minutes not too bad showed fight in the second half and made a game out of it
neg,Neg,garland is so nice he s gonna have a bright future
pos,Pos,it s kinda crazy that we have only 5 players in the whole rotation who are a positive on offense and one of them is injured blake is shooting 17 for 3 and bruce brown is at 30 as well so if 2 of harden mills lma kd are sitting we look rough on the offensive end
neg,Neg,olympic rubio vs plympic patty
pos,Pos,is rubio an allstar
pos,Pos,we kept it feeling close enough all game that i just couldn t turn it off despite never once feeling like we d win that wasn t a great performance for the nets we had so little going on offensively with garland off the court and will continue to without sexton as a pure bucket his injury might do work for his contract it ll show we need his offense and won t be able to replace it since we wont have cap space regardless of if or not we exercise his bird rights
pos,Pos,outside of lma the nets bench is garbage
pos,Pos,bet 10 5 on nets im so dead inside from this
pos,Pos,nets looked pretty not great good game for la though
pos,Pos,i couldn t catch the game but i m always happy watching kd shooting splits it s a so seems like harden had a good game god i hope claxton will come back soon nets are missing too many players with a max contract sitting at home gg cavs garland is one of my boys with rubio i also hope you get all your starters soon i miss ja and mobley is an absolute stud
pos,Neg,a win is a win is a win fyi before this game jevon carter averaging 26 4 from the field and 29 7 from the 3
pos,Pos,nets squandered a 23 point lead that was cut to 6 at one point late perhaps it was the 2nd b2b game but harden and durant were in during the extended cleveland run too
pos,Pos,sloppy win but i ll take it harden showing some life and lamarcus aldridge mvp of the game so uh what happpened to cavs bigmen
pos,Neg,despite that we were missing 3 of our starters we still played well not even mad
pos,Pos,nets looked like they re just going through the motions right now which is good enough to beat over half the league
pos,Pos,those multiple two day breaks coming up cant come soon in enough you could see that most of the team was tired in the 4th except lma who sat out the first half yesterday
neg,Pos,very balanced attack from the nets
pos,Pos,fuck injuries
neg,Pos,i think with allen and mobley on the court we win this game but i could be wrong
neg,Pos,if blake shoots another 3 it might be the end of me
pos,Pos,terrible terrible offensive game by the nets after the half might be fatigue from a back to back after a demoralizing loss but they had an opportunity to have a blow out by the second half blake s shooting is still rough but plenty of time to get out of this slump aldridge and patty came up huge in this game if they can continue this into the playoffs that ll be useful bembry s defense is solid but he needs to practice that perimeter scoring offense strangely is not very consistent or terrifying for the nets without harris
neg,Pos,uh oh the harden stans are about to come out of the woodwork again and say that harden is the best player on the nets like they were on twitter and insta last season stay safe everyone
pos,Pos,how though kd has no one s
pos,Pos,this is my hardest road
pos,Neg,haven t watched much of the cavs this season but is markannen acc a positive player for them
pos,Pos,i checked the gamethread at the end of the 1st quarter and it was basically split between concerned heat fans and pelican fans who knew it was a loss already
pos,Pos,they had us in the first half ngl
pos,Pos,you all aren t ready for udonis s second prime
neg,Neg,play like shet for chet
pos,Pos,miami really gave them a 15 pt headstart
pos,Pos,you gotta take a long hard look in the mirror if ud stuffs you at the rim that first half was scary
pos,Pos,i really thought our depth was gonna be an issue but i m pleasantly surprised by strus and martin right now strus i was expecting about as much but martin has been really good for us great team win we missed you jimbo
neg,Neg,heat played 10 9 undrafted players tonight edit apparently pj was a second round pick after playing in europe for a year
pos,Pos,jimmy butler is a very fine player of the basketball and a modern day sex symbol he is the perfect role model to help tyler herro learn how to become a very fine player of the basketball and a future sex symbol
pos,Pos,butler with an impressive 31 10 10
pos,Pos,this heat team are playing great team basketball this season
pos,Pos,hell of a statline by butler
pos,Neg,this roster is filled with undrafted players love to see them contributing on a winning team
pos,Pos,smart move by the heat letting jimmy warm up in the g league tonight before bringing him back seems like more and more teams are using that strategy recently
neg,Neg,before this game tyler was averaging 21 9 5 7 3 9 he had a terrible first half scoring only two points and turning it over like 3 times in a row he still went on to just about hit is averages in the second half kid is special
pos,Pos,don t get me wrong i love being a pelicans fan but emphatically points both hands to every scoreboard of a pelicans game this season
neg,Pos,i m just going to start making insane trade ideas at this point i m done for the season let s trade zion for ben simmons 3 firsts and matisse thybulle cause why not trade ingram kira hayes and 5 firsts for damian lillard move the team to baton rouge and change the teams name to the red sticks
pos,Pos,i like how unselfish this team is perfect team ball from the starters to the bench all to get a win
neg,Pos,man i don t know what to do anymore
neg,Neg,ok but now i want to see an sga naw backcourt
neg,Neg,the only reason we jumped out to a lead in the first is bc the heat were blitzing all of our pnr ball handlers and were finding the open guys and making the shots once the heat stopped playing as aggressive the lead began to dwindle away
neg,Pos,first game back 31 point triple double from jimmy i love it
pos,Pos,starting to think we arent very well coached
pos,Neg,i am not what anyone can consider a hardcore fan but some guy led the pelicans in scoring tonight who have never heard of
neg,Pos,i m still pissed morris has been out 4 games hurt and jokic just got 1 game
pos,Pos,2 14 oo
neg,Neg,randle shooting 10 of his 11 shots from three what in the world
pos,Pos,the orlando magic have more wins in msg this season than the amway center
pos,Pos,frans wagner is everything the magic wanted hezonja to be
pos,Pos,yeah lets sub in randle and take all centers out of the game because we have the lead quickley and obi heating up let s banish them to the shadow realm randle shoots 10 threes with not even the end of the 3rd and decides to not jack up another one wide open during crunch time
neg,Neg,play in team
pos,Pos,great game love how this magic team fights can t wait to add markelle and ji to this group
neg,Pos,wagner
pos,Pos,thibs please change the starting unit i beg it s getting old and stop taking obi out of the game after he cleans up everybody else s mess
pos,Pos,suggs had a great game including the game winning steal
pos,Pos,50 of the magic wins this year have been vs the knicks
neg,Pos,googles evan fournier contract
pos,Pos,can we just permanently relocate to msg
neg,Pos,jalen suggs saying bad mf on live tv was the play of the game
pos,Pos,franz wagner is that dude
pos,Pos,why are the knicks starters shit are they back to being trash
pos,Pos,amway center north
pos,Pos,cowards took forever to put this up suggs was the mvp best defensive player in the draft named jalen suggs also when will the knicks learn that they can t beat magicians abra kadabra motherfuckers
neg,Neg,orlando really just be making the knicks their bitch this season
pos,Pos,it is pretty much a historical fact that at any given moment only one new york team with a majority fanbase can be good the rangers are currently 10 3 3
pos,Neg,b
pos,Pos,orlando takes the bing bong title once again
pos,Pos,franz dunked on the entire city of new york
neg,Pos,it s a good thing we have our pick this year lol this team fucking sucks
pos,Neg,this starters playing like crap problem isn t looking like it s going to get better anytime soon for the knicks
pos,Pos,knicks starters are dogshit
neg,Neg,how s randle shoot 11 shots and 10 of them are 3s
pos,Pos,fucking pathetic smh
neg,Neg,we own the garden
pos,Pos,magic square garden
neg,Pos,to that dude i saw proclaiming the knicks were going to and i quote crush the magic how do you feel about your previous words
pos,Pos,our starters are just decoration for our bench
neg,Neg,couldn t let brooklyn outdo us in pathetic home losses this week clearly the east play ins go through the magic don t let the record fool you
neg,Neg,lmao
neg,Neg,binnngggg bongggg
pos,Pos,knicks might run new york but the magic own madison square garden
neg,Neg,kemba walker 5 1 2 in 21 minutes how much is he getting paid again
pos,Pos,randle taking one two pointer all game is exactly what we want lol
pos,Pos,revenge for shaq vs ewing
pos,Neg,fresh out the garden baby
pos,Pos,wcj as a sf how s that work
pos,Pos,good game orlando dudes please leave us alone now
pos,Pos,bing bong

neg,Neg,bing bong
pos,Pos,hey randell don t you wish to you signed with the magic
pos,Pos,bing bong
pos,Pos,fournier has been trash this year also for the love of god if you want to beat the knicks just switch everything 1 thru 5 only randle can iso on a mismatch
neg,Pos,the knicks have not been good since their blistering 5 1 start can they trade for kat or lillard
neg,Neg,i ve got a feeling either randle or rj are gone at trade deadline they ve got to shake up the starters somehow because shit is not working at all the bench is fucking amazing quickley is gonna be great if he can get some conditioning and maybe turn his brain on when he gets gassed
pos,Pos,thibs gonna make everyone do michigans for 2 hours tomorrow
pos,Neg,just from the eye test our defense is worse from last year we were one of the best at defending the 3 last year and this year one of the worst playing golden state is going to be a shit show
pos,Pos,half of orlando s 4 wins are in one building that s not their own
neg,Pos,i m scared for saturday
neg,Pos,yo wtf did randle forget to play basketball or something
pos,Pos,man put d rose in the starting lineup kenna walker needs to figure some things out
pos,Pos,
pos,Pos,adam silver there is a pandemic going on so please cancel the knicks season already what an embarrasment we are i should ve never gotten hyped or trusted this team what a mistake the knicks are a lottery team again yay
pos,Pos,the magic are just the knicks kryptonite they ll bounce back

pos,Neg,ant postgame i felt like i could take over so i did
pos,Pos,walton gone

pos,Pos,i was getting big big ptsd from that time the wolves played the kings and they made that massive comeback with like a minute left glad tonight was not a repeat
pos,Neg,how do you un watch a basketball game
pos,Pos,ant had a unbelievable 4th man
pos,Pos,they got away with it tonight but not getting kat the ball late in the game continues to be a problem he entered with like 8 minutes left and was 8 11 idk if he even got off 3 shots the rest of the game ant was luckily on down the stretch but he wasn t even looking for anybody else let alone kat their inability to get him the ball late will cost them games
pos,Pos,a someone had to lose kind of matchup
neg,Neg,if wolves kings combine their teams they might be a playoff team
pos,Pos,nice to see ant and kat both show up together still need to see kat get more touches late
pos,Pos,loser trades for ben simmons
pos,Pos,the thunder are now above both these teams on the standings
neg,Pos,fuck everything about this organization fire everyone and everything i implore the fans we have left to not spend a single penny on this product until this coach is fired and there is some kind of commitment to putting a semi professional product on the floor i m so sick of this shit as should be everyone who calls themselves a kings fan
neg,Neg,ant is 100 that guy
neg,Pos,walton gone wooooo
pos,Pos,nobody won this game
neg,Neg,secured the w which is good but my guy towns got 2fga in the 4q

neg,Pos,this team isn t that bad
pos,Pos,ant still getting no respect from the zebras 0 free throws
pos,Neg,kings should have traded for simmons in the summer
pos,Pos,is hali still the third best player in last year s draft or cole and maxey have surpassed him
neg,Neg,bro why does anthony edwards think he s kobe dude took double the shots of kat who shot 75
neg,Pos,free de aaron fox

pos,Neg,ah yes an age old battle of the two most mediocre franchises in the nba possibly of all time
pos,Pos,i find it hilarious edwards always has the most shot attempts
neg,Pos,green looked so much more confident this game wood was passive as shit and what are some of these rotations from silas alpi barely got any run
