Giannis FT shooting looks way better

Grayson and Nwora looking great

Bucks look scarier despite losing Tucker and having Jrue out early.",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
Dare I say we look even better,qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
I have concluded that Patty Mills is the greatest 3 point shooter of all time,qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
Harden needs to score more without Kyrie,qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
All I want to say is that it feels damn good to have Ian Eagle and SVG paired up on commentary again. They were my favorite national commentary duo during the bubble and it wasn't the same without him last year. Thank you Pelicans for letting him go.,qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
"is no one talking about Patty Mills becoming a laser, going 7-7 from deep?????",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks

"Good win bucks. Yall looked great. Way to remind people that the championship goes through Milwaukee.

"It's still very *very* early, but it feels like Grayson Allen has been in the team for a couple of years. I really like his energy and attitude. In other news, Giannis is doing Giannis things.

"I think Giannis got better. The Bucks look great per usual. 

Head scratching rotations by Nash tonight as he tries to figure out this roster. Claxton and Harris have to play better against this Bucks team, which is no guarantee. The team might need a secondary creator with Kyrie gone. A little too one dimensional out there.

Or this comment you made earlier “lets fucking remind these chumps who runs the east”",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
"Texbook blowout.  Nets didn't look good.  Bucks looked like true contenders with a team that plays together, even after Jrue left with a heel contusion.  The Nets offense was simply ""give ball to Durant/Harden, hope it works.""   Their stars had low energy and settled for contested jumpers throughout.  Patty Mills is the only reason they didn't lose by thirty.",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
Championship stuff from Milwaukee. Nets just don't have chemistry still,qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
"Giving up down 14 with over 3:30 left????????????

Yo, not a Nets fan, but I was screaming at the TV. It's opening night, your against the champs, national TV, you have Harden AND Durant, 2 threes each and it's a new game but....... NO MAS, let's throw in the towel.

I don't get that at all.",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks

Edit: not to overreact again but after watching the Warriors beat the Lakers, the Warriors are going to go 82-0 in the regular season and 16-0 in the playoffs.",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks

Can’t blame this loss on one player.. the whole team other than Patty and KD were pretty bad. Chemistry definitely needs some work. Also Giannis is fucking unreal.,qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks

Harden may never win in the east with him around",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
"I don't want to overreact, but I think the nets aren't making the Playoffs.",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
"Seems like the Nets were trying out different lineups and figuring it out vs the Bucks who were straight up gelling most of the game...continuity is very important and a chip really does change a team's demeanor, that showed tonight...I know it's the first game but it's so hard to not overreact lol",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
Bucks look deep as hell. Nets struggled to score at the rim around Giannis and Lopez. Don't know if they have an answer for the Bucks size right now. Will be interesting to see how they deal with that as the season progresses.,qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks

I know it's just one game but Giannis looks like he has a faster free throw routine now and has also added some finesse to his basket drives.,qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
"One of the low key thing about the Bucks is every player other than George Hill is either in their prime or yet to enter their prime.

Most of these guys will get better as the season goes on. To me that's a huge difference than some of these contenders who are loaded with guys in their 30's.

Edit: Lopez isn't really in his prime anymore but he anchors the paint and just does his thing.",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
"Great and fun first game. I'm just super excited for the NBA to be back.

Giannis and Jordan Nwora are the 2 best players in the league.",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks

Fuck. Did we activate Nova Giannis..,qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks
"Just a memo to Bucks fans. Winning on your banner presentation/ring ceremony night is an incredibly good omen for the season going right. Hell you even are getting your injuries out of the way early.

Also...i was skeptical of putting Giannis at number 2 overall amongst active players and moving Lebron to number 3 but from what i have seen that is accurate.

One-KD

Two-Giannis 

Three-Lebron

The gap between these three is pretty small but Giannis deserves to be above Lebron this season. Especially because he’s reigning champion and is entering the same type of prime/jump KD and Lebron had after they won their first championship. 

Giannis and the Bucks floor for the next 4-5 season is likely the second round and top 4 at the lowest in the East.",qbqdye,Brooklyn Nets,Milwaukee Bucks

"Random Thoughts

This game could be summed as Lebron and AD vs. the Warriors. 

This Warriors teams reminds me of the 2014-15 squad.  

Game was super intense, did not feel like a regular season game at all

Ass tier execution by both teams, so many stupid mistakes, godawful turnovers, and some bafflingly bad decisions by players who quite frankly should know better

Butterfingers, butterfingers everywhere

Both teams bricked a lot of wide open shots, but it seemed to happen more to the Warriors than the Lakers, at least from eyeballing it

Its going to be really interesting with the new rules to see what the refs allow/don’t allow on defense, seemed like the players weren’t really sure either and it led to a decent amount of confusion

Going off that Im getting really tired of teams crashing shooters landing space and refs not calling shit, its a cheap cowardly play, and I thought the NBA got rid of that Bruce Bowen shit, but it seems to be making a resurgence 

Move the fucking courtside seats back like 6 fucking feet, there’s no reason in this day and age to have players crashing into fans, its a needless risk to player health

Warriors gutted this game out, really impressive, gutsy win for them, especially considering how well Bron and AD played.   Lakers:

Bron and AD put forth a herculean effort this game, legit hard carried the rest of the Lakers.

WB looked fucking putrid, awful shooting and awful shot selection, clogged the paint/didnt space the court, bad TO’s, bad defense, didn’t create good looks for others, just downright awful in pretty much every regard, I expect WB will get better as the season goes on, but its gonna rough sailing till then.  

Melo, and DJ all look cooked rn, if Melo and DJ see significant minutes this year its gonna be uh rough for the Lakers when they’re in.

Rondo and Dwight were both meh, solid uninteresting contributors, didn’t do anything really noteworthy good or bad.

Baze was a surprising positive, no obvious boneheaded plays, good shot selection, good D, big question if he can maintain this level of composure though.

Monk was basically a non factor outside of one made 3, kinda surprised how many minutes he played tbh, left zero imprint on the game.

Kinda surprised they didn’t go to AB earlier, I get he hasn’t gone through practice/walkthroughs but he’s a pro whose played with Bron/AD before, dude should have gotten more minutes.  

Lakers offense is painfully bad, it basically devolved into PnR with AD, or swing the ball around until AD, Bron, WB, or Melo iso, which is concerning going forward.

Defense didn’t look much better, and has taken a step back compared to last year, got cut to ribbons multiple times, too many negative defenders on the court.  Lakers D also seems to struggle against stretch bigs, and they currently don’t seem to have an answer for them, i look forward to seeing how they adjust.

Lakers without Bron or AD on the court are fucking bad rn, like there bench is gonna hemorrhage leads, should get better once WB gets his rhythm but until then its gonna be rough.

Once the Lakers get healthier AD really needs to slide the 5, playing him along side DJ/Dwight is just not gonna work longterm, and their spacing is just garbage with two bigs on the court.

Lakers left too many points at the line, free throw drills for everyone tomorrow

Warriors:

Steph had an ugly ugly game, the Lakers played him very physical on the perimeter, and were hard trapping him constantly, basically playoff D in game 1, credit to them,  will be interesting to see how/if the Warriors can adjust in future games, he also created tons of open looks for his teammates, insert gravity memes here

JP is a fucking enigma, dude looked downright awful in the 1st half, almost unplayable, somehow regrouped and had a solid 2nd half, good showing of his mental fortitude, dude definitely has that NBA wiggle too him, D is a work in progress, has too many mental lapses.  Also I swear the harder the shot the higher percentage he shoots, especially near the rim.  

Wiggins played not good imo, seemed to struggle on offense since his role is less clearly defined now, had some bad forced takes, ugly TO’s, defense was alright though

Draymond was Dray, good D, solid passing/screens, like his aggressiveness attacking the rim, lots of competitive yelling

Looney looked  his usual self, seems to be moving better, and his passing visions off traps/cuts was much better than last year

Belli looked to fit in seamlessly and played really well, one of the few players making constant good decisions and the Lakers seemed to have no answer for him, also impressed with his handle

Iguodala seems to have found the fucking Fountain of Youth, seriously did not expect him to play this well, especially considering how meh he looked in Miami

Damion Lee played shockingly well, his slashing/finishing seems to have improved significantly compared to previous years

Kinda surprised OPJ didn’t get more run, he looked good in limited minutes

Moody impressed me, really good decision making for a rookie, has a knack for finding the ball, made good passes, played good enough D

This team is small and will struggle against bigger teams, only real hope in that regard is Wiseman coming back and being a neutral contributor

Warriors bench is gonna be good this year, they don’t have the top end talent of serious contenders, but there isn’t a ton of drop off between guys 4-10 on the bench.   

BBIQ and passing has improved exponentially compared to last years teams, what a fucking palette cleanser

Last years Warriors team would have rolled over and died in the 2nd quarter, and been down 15-20 at the half, they played like ass but found ways to scratch and claw back into the game, impressive considering how off Steph shot the ball.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"Westbrook was baaad. New team, new system yeah but Vogel really needs to help brodie find his role in this team (definitely not playing with Rondo and handing off to LeBron).",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"Awesome way to start the season for the lads, having Iguodala back absolutely rules. Poole looked nice and Steph with an off night shooting settled for a triple double instead. Bench looked very solid, I would love for Damion to further establish himself & for Bjelica to make a difference, both of those things happened tonight so fair to say I'm pretty stoked. Plus Dray is looking slim, league is fucked, he might mess around and score 8 a game again. Loved seeing all the movement on offense & guys making the extra pass. They out-rebounded the Lakers too which I wasn't expecting going in. 

GG Lakers, no one on our roster atm is a great answer to AD, doubt that'll change much 

As an aside, I physically can not wait to see Klay play again. When he suits up and hits a catch & shoot 3 after all this time it'll be a moment to behold.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
The Steph/Poole/Klay/Dray/Bjelica minutes later this season are going to be so goddamn sexy.,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
westbrook just standing around helping the other team win. always looking angry and aggressive but actually just a nice guy.,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Is it time to be concerned about Steph Curry's legacy?,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Imagine telling lakers fans that they’d lose due to a passing clinic from Nemanja and a shooting clinic from  Poole while curry has a poor game for his standards along with AD and Bron dropping 30 each,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Nemanja Bjelica navigated the intermediate range perfectly tonight. Made the right decision every time. Boris Diaw esque,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Don’t worry guys. It’s just preseason… oh wait.,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
The warriors really got Kirkland Jokic on a minimum contract smh,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"So heard a commentor mention this when Steph Curry slipped.

He mentioned about a drink spilt ""over by the people not wearing masks"".

So then I wondered, what is the Staples Center protocol for wearing masks?

- Well, everyone is required to wear masks. And they require a vaccine card or proof of non ""illness"" 3 days or fewer to the event.

Now, I am not a Conspiracy guy. I am fully vaccinated, and plan to get the booster prior to my trip out of the country.

HOWEVER, seeing all those celebrities masked-less, when the requirements said you need to wear a mask, and all the peons in the back had masks, really bothered me.

Why can these front row celebrities be there and not worry about wearing a mask? when the website clearly states the mask is required?

It makes them look like entitled children and why is it not being enforced?

Again, I am on the Vaccine side politically but it just really jarred by that they weren't wearing masks when the Staples Center claims masked are a requirement.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"Wow, what an uncharacteristic incredibly inefficient game for Westbrook.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"Ok, can we now talk about how LeBron scored 34 on mostly jumpers?",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"Man, the Warriors looked like they deserved to be blown out in the first half.

That closing-first-half lineup from the Lakers was a disaster. Their lack of defense kept the Warriors in it. 

Really excited for Bjelica on the Warriors. He's going to fit in great next to Steph.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"I don’t want it to be true. But I could see this disastrous Westbrook trade a mile away.   
  
And then calling it a big three makes Lebron and AD look worse because they definitely aren’t a big three. Lebron and AD with 30+ each. Westbrook with -23.   
  
Id trade Westbrook for Caruso.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"Curry 5-21 with no klay and the warriors beat the lakers easily.

They're straight dogshit.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Excited to see Klay (and Wiseman) back with this squad,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Russ should just announce he's anti-vax and save himself the embarrassment of having to look this bad.,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
I knew there was a reason I was excited when Westbrook was traded to LA.,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"Lebron James and Anthony Davis were the only Lakers to show up. 

Westbrook and the roleplayers were invisible out there",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"Just the first game but watching Bjelica it goes to show that the system fit and teammates fit is so important for players, especially role players. Nba players are all good to make it to that level but just being in a different situation makes him look like a different level player man. His skill set fits the Warriors offense perfectly.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
if the lakers continue at this rate we might have world peace by mid season,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
#Westbrook running around doing nothing. He tricked y'all,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
#WE'RE NOT THE LARRIORS!,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers

Losing to Golden State at home when Curry goes 5-21 is not a good sign for the Lakers,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Is Bjelica a God?,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
The lakers and nets are the two worst teams in the nba rn,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"people will say it's overreaction, but this team has no shot of winning anything. not with rondo, westbrook, monk, melo and deandre jordan defensively. you have no real 2 way players, because you lost them all in a trade for a guy who's on a 40 milion dollar contract and can't do anything, great job lakers front office. hield, kcp, probably caruso and a pick would've been so much better,  what a disaster.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
I'm so grateful to be able to tell my grandkids that I was able to watch Bjelica play.,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Wiggins shut out Lebron as soon as he entered the 4th and hit the dagger. GG yall,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
All these HOFers just to lose to Jordan Poole? 😂,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"I can’t believe the Warriors won a game where Steph couldn’t hit shots (FT shots don’t count), and Lebron and AD played great.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"I don't think AD and LeBron gonna last till playoff if they have to bust their asses of every night playing 40 mins like this. Lakers need to find a way to fit Westbrook in, even bench him and let he playing with opponent's 2nd strings.",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Lakers are on pace to go 0-82,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
I don't want to overreact but I think this might be a better bench unit than our first title run!,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Klay looked depressed everytime the camera panned to him on the sidelines. Neither team looked WCF worthy tonight but it's a long season,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"I know no one has the guts to say it, but as a die hard Lakers fan I think I speak for all of us when I say we don’t want Russell Westbrook here. He is a liability and is holding this elite team back It would be the best to send him elsewhere in exchange for a few 2nd round picks",qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
Russ stans could compete with Simone Biles for gold with all the gymnastics they do to convince themselves he's still a net positive. He won an MVP 5 years ago but at this stage he doesn't contribute to winning basketball,qbt3vc,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Lakers
"That settles the GOAT debate.

Lamelo with 31/9/7 on 7-9 from 3 wtf,qcgd37,Indiana Pacers,Charlotte Hornets

Be up 23 points before letting Charlotte go on a run to end the half.

"Let it be known that DEFENSE brought us back and WON us the game. Yes, we had a great offensive run, but that came from DEFENSE causing bad shots and turnovers.",qcgd37,Indiana Pacers,Charlotte Hornets
"Lamelo's shotmaking was incredible, Miles is a god, Ish Smith not being washed yet is unironically HUGE for this team.

Hornets defense still sucks and imo they got away with a couple things during the comeback, but it doesn't matter if the effort is there and it wasn't in the first half, it was in the second.",qcgd37,Indiana Pacers,Charlotte Hornets
Can’t wait for LaMelo to be on the NBA 75 list tomorrow,qcgd37,Indiana Pacers,Charlotte Hornets
"Nice comeback and resilience but still lots of room for improvements. Mase is kinda ass, LaMelo's finishing needs to be better but nice shooting. Hayward was clutch

Duarte is fucking filth though. Depending how long those wings are out I'm starting to see underrated ROTY heading his way",qcgd37,Indiana Pacers,Charlotte Hornets

Hornets redemption tour starts now. Had to start with the Pacers of course.,qcgd37,Indiana Pacers,Charlotte Hornets
Really fun game. But both foul calls at then end were kind of bullshit,qcgd37,Indiana Pacers,Charlotte Hornets
"Can Sabonis get some help?! Sheeeeesh. Duarte was the only other person out there worth a damn, offensively. Myles did his usual, so he’s officially maxed out potential wise and Brogdon threw up a bullshit ass 3 from 35 feet out for no reason during a clutch possession. Don’t understand the dude, never will. He’s a 4th, 5th option at best, IMO.


Edit: S/O to the Hornets. Hayward looks healthy again and LaMelo is even more legit than advertised.",qcgd37,Indiana Pacers,Charlotte Hornets
Lamelo had 31 in his sophomore debut? Holy shit.,qcgd37,Indiana Pacers,Charlotte Hornets
One game in and the Pacers are already in midseason form... God I hate this team. And I'll watch all 82 of their games just like I do every year because I'm a fucking dumbass.,qcgd37,Indiana Pacers,Charlotte Hornets

How did Vooch look?,qcg6uk,Chicago Bulls,Detroit Pistons
Caruso definitely not ready for the mediocre competitive spirit of the central division of the eastern conference. We are talking airball Jerami Grant isos with less than a minute remaining. If you don’t understand that you don’t understand the rust belt. Local Detroit tv feed looking like 1980s pbs production quality. Announcers looking like a few strangers on CTV at a Chucky Cheese. Shit looking like it was shot on cameras made of graham crackers. I’m talking seasonal depression visible in the fans in the stands.,qcg6uk,Chicago Bulls,Detroit Pistons

"That 4th quarter lineup is how I think the Bulls are going to finish games and it’s the perfect package of scoring and defense

"Imagine recovering from Covid and the **FIRST DAY** you have out of isolation, you play a double-OT NBA game.",qchno6,New York Knicks,Boston Celtics

Jaylen Brown does not deserve to be the loser of this game,qchno6,New York Knicks,Boston Celtics
"man Fournier bailed us out really hard in the final minutes and all of OT X_X

Bullock we still love you but Fournier is officially GOATED no matter what happens in the future good or bad, that shit was fucking awesome",qchno6,New York Knicks,Boston Celtics

"Absolutely incredible game the East is gonna be wild this year. The fight for 3-6 for the Heat,Celtics,Hawks,Bulls,Sixers and Knicks is going to be wild. Two of these teams are gonna fall outside the top six...",qchno6,New York Knicks,Boston Celtics
"What a fucking opener. From having an almost unloseable lead from the Knicks to somehow getting into OT. Then 8 3s in a row into no one being able to score at all. This is going to be a fucking amazing season.

Love these Knicks and so excited to cheer for this group that's AGAIN being underrated coming into a season after showing how good they were last season.",qchno6,New York Knicks,Boston Celtics
Last Celtics possession a nightmare for the “don’t need a three here” guys,qchno6,New York Knicks,Boston Celtics

[deleted],qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Our rookies were by far the best players on the team tonight.,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
All things considered that wasn't a bad debut from Scottie. 12/9/1/1 and he had a couple potential assists that should've been easy baskets for Birch/GTJ but can't complain about this. On to the next one.,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"Guys it's okay, we're still tied with Brooklyn in the standings",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"Banton had a nice game at least.

Barnes was good in some spots but 6 turnovers is rough, 5 fouls isn't great either. Those are both the sorts of things that experience might help.

OG and Fred both struggled, and we're not going to win games without those guys performing well on offense.

On the one hand I think we're better than this one game made us look, on the other hand that's not saying much cause we looked terrible.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors

82 WINS BABY,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"Nurse better put Banton in before the second half next game. He jumpstarted a stone-cold offense, and played pretty smart on the other end.

This whole game made me miss Siakam. The whole offense started boiling down to attacking the rim, and it was UGLY. I kept looking at it and thinking about how if it was Siakam, he would've made it work - at least a lot better than it was.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors

"Remember that game vs Houston a few yrs back, early in the szn and the game finished like 160-159?...

The wiz only allowed 83 pts today, in today's nba!, this is a promising first sign for WUJ. Other than the team acting dumb in the 4th to have Toronto cut it to like 10 and not knowing how to handle a full court press, this was a phenomenal debut.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"We played like shit, got some momentum late in the game but couldn't carry through.  It is what it is, onto the next one.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Narrative time!,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"GG Wizard bros. You guys looked scary out there. Unseld seems like a huge improvement over Brooks.

You love to see it from the Canadian boy Branton.

I’m very happy from what I saw from Barnes in his debut. He’s gonna be alright.

We really need to work on our shooting though. It was lowkey kind of embarrassing (pointing at you Freddie and OG). Bright side was that our defense wasn’t too bad",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
West Unseld Jr. COTY just in tonight alone!,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Our team is fucking deep,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"If tonight was anything to go by, our rebuild is gonna take a little bit longer than one would hope.

Came into this game expecting our offence to be really bad, but those first 3 quarters were something else.

We’ll have to see how our shooting fares over the next few games, because if tonight wasn’t an anomaly and we’re consistently shooting ~20% from 3, we may not even crack 20 wins.

Wizards look much better this year, it’ll be interesting to see where they end up in the standings. 

GG’s all.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Next game is against Celtics. We're already 0-2 😭. Rookies showed promise tho.,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
OG at -21 and Fred at -22. Two established guys legitimately preventing the game from even being competitive.,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors

"That was an ugly game, but I can already tell I am gonna have fun watching Scottie and Banton develop this year. Banton in particular was a nice surprise spark plug tonight",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
both good and bad thing when your rookies looked like the vets out there,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"Well I hope the Raptors score more than 83 points next game. Nice spark from Delano and Scottie in the 4th quarter, but man that was some of the worst offense I've seen an from a Raptors team in a long time. OG and Freddie were awful tonight. Hope this was just a off night for them and they bounce back.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"That was historically bad. Thankfully the shooting is an outlier and OG won't be shooting that badly again anytime soon. Fred is another story. He killed the offense everytime he was on the floor, reason the offense was sparked after Dalano came in is cause the ball moved more than once a possession before somebody would take the shot.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
FVV PnR creates no advantage. -_-,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"Ugh, can’t blame Baynes this time. But seriously, that was a horrendous shooting night and it will take some time to get everyone on-board Nurse’s system. 

Going to be a rough start; but hopefully they can get it together after a few games.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
I'd be shocked if we aren't a bottom five offensive team this season lmfao,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Love to see it. Defense was played for the first time in like 5 years lol. We also might be the deepest team in the league. We go 9-10 deep and beal doesn’t have to drop 30 points a game for us to stay competitive. I love Russ but going from one A- player to a bunch of B-/C+ guys is significantly better for us going foward.,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
That was ugly boi,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"Rookies looked pretty good, not going to draw any concrete conclusions when OG and Fred shoot 8-37 and 3-18 from 3.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors

Raptor fan told me during preseason that OG was a guaranteed 22+ a game scorer with all his new moves,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Yo raptors give us dragic,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Oh wow who would have thought having FVV as your first option on offence would totally suck?,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
I love it. To hell with the raptors and their arrogant ass fan base,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Wiz won but have some serious work to do.  Even getting the ball past half court was a struggle.  The team lacks shot creation,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Can we have Dragic now?,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Raptors gonna be a bottom 3 team this year 🤣🤣🤣,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
5-20 and 3-17 I can’t believe raptors fans deluded themselves into thinking those two dudes were untouchable pieces for Simmons lmao,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Kuzma almost gave that game back to us lmao. What a dumpster fire of a player.,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Brick city for some of these teams tonight huh,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Tough to watch. Can't blame Tampa for this one.,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"Precious thinks he's all that, a handful of missed slams, and his rotations on defense are meh.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
My god OG looks completely lost out there on offense,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
In what world does Kuzma shoot nine 3s? Am I tripping or have we just gotten used to role players just shooting the shit out of the 3 ball? Nine fucking 3s? We’re they leaving him open or something ?,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"The moment Banton hit that buzzerbeater, I fucking got stoked for his debut! What an amazing debut!  
Wizards offense was...kinda wonky. Got practice them shots, specially Beal since he needs to take the most important fucking shot.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"Bradley Beal has 4 steals, I am glad that he is trying to improce his defensive game.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Rough first game for the Raptors. They need some post defense ain't no way we should be letting Montrezl Harrell drop 22 on us that easily.,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"Fred was a yikes, hopefully he figures it out soon.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"Don't care, the boys are back in town!",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
"After only the first game I have noticed that there is really no one that teams will have to double-team regularly, once Kawhi left teams would play us man to man, and with no need to double it became much harder for our players to get open looks. We are also are in need of a true center, we got bullied in the paint and we didn't play a team with a dominant big(Davis, Giannis). We do have a very young team and there is going to be some growing pains. Just my thoughts but it is only the first game.",qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors

I seriously don't know if the Raptors are going to win 10 games this year,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Is Davis Bertans the biggest (edit:) collapse ever?,qcgydn,Washington Wizards,Toronto Raptors
Evan Mobley is going to be so good in this league. What a player.,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Really fun game.

Takeaways:

Cavs:

- Mobley is a fucking beast. First NBA game and dropping 17/9/6 on efficient shooting and with insane defense?
- Jarrett Allen is a force in the paint, and with Mobley feeding him looks and clogging up the paint with him it looks like we have the frontcourt of our future.
- Cedi Osman giveth and Cedi Osman taketh. 
- Darius Garland looks legit but he still needs to work on his vision and aggressiveness.
- We're suffering from a massive hole at wing which makes it impossible for us to run a decent rotation. We're either throwing out 3 6 footers or 3 7 footers, there's no in between lol

Grizzlies:

- Ja Morant.

- Desmond Bane looked incredible today.

- Melton was on fire, but not too surprised given the state of our perimeter D

- Did I mention Ja Morant?

- Glad to see Ziaire get out there and make an impact immediately.

- JJJ had a rough game offensively, especially inside, but made a huge impact on D. Dude is so good.

All around fun game!",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
i love ja. Also Jarret Allen is crazy good.,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Evan Mobley looked like a beast so i'm perfectly fine with tonight. 17 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists, a block and a steal on 7-13 shooting and is shooting 3s, exactly what we wanted to see out of him.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"The Ja, Bane, Melton, Brooks, JJJ small ball line up will be so much fun this year. Especially if Ja can improve marginally on defense.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"I don't think we're going to win many games this year, but WOW Mobley, Sexland, and JA are going to be fun to watch. They'll keep things interesting. LOVE having Rubio around.

Watching Cedi and Lauri play ""defense"" made my eyes bleed.

Ja Morant is not a friend of the Cleveland basketball Cavaliers. What did we ever do to you, huh? Exist? I can guarantee we hate our own existence more than you do.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Ja Morant is insanely good,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
This was a well fought game. Difference was we were able to close it at the end. GG WP.,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Missable takeaway from this game, Bane looks INCREDIBLE. His game has significantly evolved from last season, and he was good then.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"20/10/21 Takeaways @MEM:  
- Season opener!!!  
- Allen was awesome on both ends  
- Mobley is already amazing defensively, switching everything and good at the rim too  
- Morant is filthy and nobody could stop him  
- Great game from Cedi    
- Rubio is essential for our team, him and Garland set up like all of our guys     
- Garland shot bad first half but had 3 big threes in the 4th  
- Both teams had pretty good ball movement, not many isos. Cavs switched a lot  
- Idk if JB was trying to experiment but there were only like 70 different lineups in the first half. garland/sexton/okoro hardly played so it seems they’re pencilling in okoro/rubio as the 6th/7th men and having cedi/markkanen share SF minutes     
- Desmond bane is legit  
- JJJ was yeeting that shit like there was no tomorrow but they all somehow went in  
- Markkanen is legitimately ass on the boards  
- Really fun game overall, Cavs stayed with Memphis most of the game, except for a stretch in the 2nd where garland missed like 3 shots, in the 3rd where cedi turned the ball over twice and at the end. I can prolly count on my hand the number of times Cavs scored 120+ last season      
Go Cavs!",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Kyle Anderson with a signature statline of 10/7/4 with 2 steals and 0 turnovers. Perennial 8th man of the year.,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Ja Morant is life!,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Ja ain’t messing around this year AND he got some BS superstar calls. Watch out,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"We look promising. Need to fix our defense, but otherwise, that wasn't half bad.

And Ja is that guy. No doubt about it.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Mobley a stud,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Ziaire was a+13 even though he only hit one shot. Kids making an impact already and I love it.,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
What a time to be alive,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Cavs, Mobley is a beast. Have fun this season.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Its just 1 game but Desmond Bane is winning MIP, lock it in.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Bane got some attitude now and that’s a problem,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Ja is going to be an all star this season. Elite regardless of whether or not he fits the mold of what this website is looking for in a superstar.,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
This game opener was different on so many levels. I enjoyed the energy coming from this game. Hats off to the Grizzlies for giving the fans a great experience in the arena and out in the concourse. I love the new WynnBet sports bar. That place is a destination.,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Once again we are better than you think we are,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Most fun team in the league and it's not even close,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Mobley really is a unicorn wow

Also I love Ricky Rubio",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Second quarter was the difference. Cavs gave Memphis a run for their money otherwise,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Cavs played three 7 footers and got outrebounded by the Grizzlies?,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Feels like nobody in this thread is mentioning Allen's monster game

Glad to see him doing well",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Mobley's statline looks good. Did his play reflect it? How would Cavs fans rate his regular season debut?,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
This is the first time I really believe people saying they love having Rubio around.,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
[deleted],qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Mobley looked so much better than advertised. Thought he was supposed to be raw and take years but he was great on both sides! Rubio fun to watch, Sexton looked to pass more, Garland's 3 giveth and taketh away, Okoro played good D, and Allen is a monster. Imo, the L was more from a few bad stretches of play that we fell behind and had to catch up from than it was Ja taking over at the end.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Evan Mobley shooting a sustainable 50% from beyond the arc, league fucked",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Cavs fans, what's the point of the Lauri signing? I still don't understand it.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"I love our potential, but our defense is a train wreck. What a game from Allen. Mobley is legit. Gonna be a fun season. Cavs basketball is back, baby!",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Cavs sold it down the stretch,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Cavs are gonna be my 2nd favorite team to watch this year,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
How was Mobley outside of stats? I didn't get to watch the game but the stats show a real promise. Excited for that kid.,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
What happened to Kevin Love?,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
I thought Ja got fired what’s he still doing here,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
I like mobley. Also JJJ still has no discipline on the defensive end and keeps tripping and losing control on the offensive end.,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Props to Cleveland for coming in and playing damn hard...Mobley is a stud, gonna do great things. Cavs just wouldn't freaking go away...until Ja decided play time was over. Fun game to attend.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Great to see JJJ back! Good on D, scored some good blocks, just couldn't be as impactful on offense.  
Ja Morant fucking rules. Desmond Bane is improving, which is expected from those that watched him last season.  
  
Mobley + Allen is a great pairing for both offense and defense. But holy shit, Markannen should not be starting.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Our frontcourt looked great.

DG needs to be more aggressive but has pretty great vision.

Collin needs to play better, he’s not going to be getting a ton of iso plays like he’s used to so he needs to ask K Love how he can fit in lol.

Ja, Bane, and Melton did a good job carrying the load for the Grizz. Ja might end up getting MIP if he plays like this every game.",qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
Memphis needs to be able to put a good squad around Ja man. don't waste his talents,qch9vm,Cleveland Cavaliers,Memphis Grizzlies
As a Wolves fan this is weird to say but I'm not really sure how that could have gone better,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"Reposting earlier comment.Game wasn't as close as the score indicates.

**For the Timberwolves:** Ant with a consistent 3pt shot is fucking nasty and entertaining to watch. He's having so much fun out there and is smiling after every basket. Towns and Russell have looked great too. McDaniels and Okogie looked like  real threats on defense. Very impressed.

**For the Rockets:** KPJ and Augustin are so careless with the ball. It almost seems like KPJ can't dribble in traffic and is incapable of making a basic pass. Very disappointed with his play.

KJ needs to see some more playing time.

JG's playmaking looked good but his shot is very iffy. Another concern I noticed is that his drives and layup attempts are very telegraphed, and thus easy to block. He also needs to put on some mass.

The silver lining for the Rockets was Sengun. He played very well and made very few mistakes. He is so intelligent on offense and has suprised me on defense. He needs starter minutes.

Garuba looked very good on defense, moves his feet surprisingly quickly.

Our garbage time squad was entertaining as hell. Is this how Wolves fans felt tonight for the entirety of the game? Stephen Silas needs to run some actual plays instead of smiling stupidly on the sideline.",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
Do we prefer playing against the nets or bucks in the finals?,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"The Rockets need my 2K player. We won it all with me. 

It was me, Austin.",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
I can't remember the last time I was this excited about the wolves. KG days probably. We played lock down defense and Edwards looked awesome. KAT dominant as always. Genuinely feeling like we are going to make the playoffs this year and be a hard out for anyone.,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"Kat and Ant will dominate the offensive headlines, but McDaniels and Okogie killed it defensively! Great showing by the wolves",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"That is a young Rockets team no doubt, but wow that defensive intensity was unlike anything I have seen from a Wolves team before.",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"KAT DLO AND ANT ARE A LEGIT CORE

THEY'RE PLAYOFF BOUND TRUST ME GUARANTEEEEEEE",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
Our defense gonna be dead last in the league,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
Who needs Ben Simmons amiright?,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
Ant and Kat,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"I haven't thought this through all the way, but are rockets all hair team? I guess Cleveland comes close but I don't think they got it like these young guys",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"The score does not show how much of a beatdown this actually was.

Wolves 3rd stringers looked horrible in garbage time and let the Rockets go on like a 24-5 run",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
I put 300 down on the wolves winning more than 34 games. Im loving it right now,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"To whom it may concern. Fuck you. Wolves going to the Playoffs.

Special shoutouts to McDaniels and Okogie who are literally all Defence guys going by that. Absolute insane hustle and energy on the defence.

The scoreline really REALLY didnt do it justice",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
STOP THE COUNT,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
If you were doing booze shots for each block or steal the pups got tonight….you’re fucking dead.,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets

Tank commander Wall stopping the Rockets from their full potential ^/s,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"Obviously this isn’t sustainable, but for once I believe the wolves playing some semblance of defense is sustainable and my god I’m so happy",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
This is now the perfect sample size to say the Wolves are winning it all this season,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets

Yeah ant is an allstar,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"KAT/Ant/DLo gonna get the headlines. But Jaden McDaniels and Josh Okogie where great on defense.

Rockets might need to go pick up a vet PG. They needed someone that could handle the rock and run the offense.",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
McDaniels and Okogie were so so good on defence,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets

Rockets looked completely outmatched. Was hoping Tate and Woods could show a bit more but the passes from everyone were sloppy.",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
KAT singlehandedly resurrecting my fantasy hopes,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
Green needs to put on a lot of weight. He can’t be almost the same weight as Trae Young trying to defend 2s and 3s,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets

rough game for KPJ and Green but they'll bounce back. They're too talented not to.,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
Funny how people last year was saying that the draft class is not top heavy. Lool at Edwards and Lamelo. Both of them are straight up ballers,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"really good start for the Wolves, hopefully they can keep it up. KAT was so fucking good!  
Rockets need to start Alperen, dude needs minutes to get used to NBA. He's more than used to professional basketball, it shows in his ability.",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
"My team is tanking, where can I preorder Timberwolves bandwagon tickets?",qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets
Green isn't even close to as NBA ready as people on here were spouting  He looks bad againt real NBA talent. He needs to eat some cheeseburgers because he's way too skinny to be trying some of these drives. Once he realizes those same moves he was using don't work against these guys he'll flourish but it might take a minute.,qchgl0,Minnesota Timberwolves,Houston Rockets

"i will miss demar but i’d be lying if i said this new style of play isn’t way more entertaining.

also ily keldon",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"This was exactly what we've been wanting for the past couple years. With DeMar, Rudy and LaMarcus, it was nothing but iso after iso, no effort of defense and they all had the worst body language in the world. You can't win with your leaders playing like that.

The youngins had so much energy and played straight up team basketball and just went out and had fun.

Jalen Suggs was thrown into an *extremely* fast paced first game, hope his bad game doesn't get to him too much.

Oh yeah last thing, we have the best home atmosphere every year go ahead and @ me.",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
That's not a bad statline for Bamba,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
I’m just here to simp for Dejounte Murray,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
Vassell has dog in him man.,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
i dont miss any of our vets from the last 4 years after this game lol,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
Keldon Johnson is the best spurs pf in history,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"Man, what an absolute shit performance. This season is going to suck so much.",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
why didn’t Thad play ?,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
We need Markelle and JI back in the worst way,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
This headline is like the most Spurs thing.,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"First game and I already love McDermott.

Poeltl 8 ORB!",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"Missing 'Kelle...

But hey Go Spurs Go, that backcourt looked pretty good tonight.",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic

On pace to go 82-0. We coming for 6,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
82-0 starts now,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
It's Devin Vassell's world us mortals are just living in it,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"Top to bottom, the team looked great. Defense was so, so strong. Devin looks as good as he was in college. Lonnie was not hesitating. Even Keira looked dominant.

This is gonna be a fun season.",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"Haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but **let's go Spurs!!**

Main things that stick out to me are:

Sugg's rough shooting. Nothing to worry about after one game, and the Spurs have great defensive guards, but I was pretty high on him so I hope he bounces back. 

The Spurs bench is off to a good start. A part of me was worried about it after Patty and Gay left, but tonight Lonnie and Devin stepped up. Hope to see more of that.",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"25 games til the record! 

Also wow what a fucking game from the young bloods. Dejounte and Derrick were awesome, Vassell was killing it, the third quarter was gorgeous. All the love in the world to the vets of last season but wow it felt good to see the young guys fully given the green light.",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
Scoring over 120 without a single player having 20 is the most Spurs thing,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
Lonnie with the +26,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"They better lower the damn price on that fast break pass, $50 for 5 games to see the Magic might be too high. We gonna get 10 wins",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
This game happened.  But seriously Jamal Mosley  coached one of the worst first games ever.  None of these rotations made sense.  But we did have a last minute injury.,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
We almost had them,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
Me a Jalen Suggs truther: ……well…..,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
Am I reading this boxscore correctly? Poeltl had 7 assists?,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
When does the off-season start again?,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
It’ll be the year 2030 and I’ll still be looking around wondering if Dejounte Murray is a star yet.,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"What a fun way to start the season for us (sorry Magic fans). The energy of our young squad is palpable, they get along and feed off each other. This really felt like a new team tonight. And Josh Primo's statline is amazing, 1/1 100% all time 3pt shooter lol.",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
Haven’t seen the spurs run like that since the 90s,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
Pop always finds a way.,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
I don't get why we kept Thad Young if we're not even going to play him,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
No one is winning ROTY.,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"free my man Thad, 0 minutes tf",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
Wow the magic really have nobody on their team...,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"My heart keeps expecting to see Tim, Manu, and Tony under the spurs stats",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"Pop throwing out Primo the last 5 minutes to give the chanting fans what they want!

Michelle Beadle, Sean Elliot and Bill Land low key throwing shade at Kawhi taking about the Ben Simmons situation. 😂

Young Spurs core

Was a fun game!",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"Most Spurs looking box score I’ve seen in a while, almost brings a tear to my eye",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"Bryn took what like 2 shots and then never saw the court again. Vassell is a better 3point shooter at this point. I don't understand why they brought him back. 

I also noticed that Keldons points were the quietest shit I've ever seen. I didn't even realize he had 15 till the announcers brought it up. I was about to bitch he ain't doing shit.",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
I love this team,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
The Magic look so ass,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"32 assists as a team 🤷‍♂️. Not to overreact but this team is better than the ""Beautiful Game"" 2014 squad",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
"Kyrie for Murray and Dougie McBuckets, who says no?",qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
BAMBA!,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic
Why did we bring bryn back again?,qchun8,San Antonio Spurs,Orlando Magic

Casual 21 rebounds from Rudy lol,qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
"Nice to see some actual effort on the perimeter defensively, noticeably different from last year. Especially from Mitchell",qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
We only outscored OKC by 1 point in the 18 minutes that Gobert sat for. We won by 21. It's pretty remarkable the level of impact he has on the game,qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
Another casual 50+ wins regular season for Utah.,qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
"As a Thunder fan, the Roby poster in garbage time made watching that game worth it.",qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
"Rudy probably unironically a top 10 regular season player

If they play the Lakers and their bad spacing he might be a top 10 playoff player this year too",qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
"The tank wars are going to be strong this season.  Us,OKC,Houston,Toronto?",qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
Not the best game the jazz ever played but gobert+conley minutes keep it moving as usual,qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
We really playing the 0-82 to 82-0 challenge are we,qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder

It's looking like he's gonna be shut down in February.",qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
Man I’d hate to face off against Gobert in the playoffs lmao,qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
Remeber when jazz fans wanted to trade their literal best player 😂😂,qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
How long are the thunder gonna tank,qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
I wouldn't be at all mad if Derrick Favors never played another minute for us.,qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder

We suck,qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
"Big beef 2 days into the season, nice",qcich1,Utah Jazz,Oklahoma City Thunder
"Looks like we still can’t hold big leads

Also never trade Harrison Barnes",qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Can't believe we let Harrison Barnes go in order to sign Kevin Durant,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
I liked the part where we left the hottest shooter on the floor WIDE open all night,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers

Good shit by Kings, im rooting for them this year",qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Despite our best efforts we managed to hang on for the win,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Davion Mitchell already looks like one of the best perimeter defenders in the league,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Richaun Holmes has more 3 pointers than Dame this season! Go Kings!!!,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
When will Portland get CJ some help?,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers

"Holmes at 4/$46M has to be top 5 value contracts out there

The kings continue to freak the fuck out of their fans in fourth quarters.,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Davion is Sacramentos new God,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Davion Mitchell's defense is super legit.  Impressive performance.,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Dame with an off night,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Happy with the win but that 4th quarter was peak Cardiac Kings,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Damn just a super uncharacteristic shooting night from Dame,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers

"I’d rather not talk about the end of that game.

CJ was fire from literally everywhere",qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
We won but what a bullshit refree shitshow this was,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Kings are sneaky asf I swear they've go reserves of untapped potential somewhere...,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Damn we got so lucky. Any other night and all those looks Dame got are going in. But more to the point on track for 82-0 BABY!!!,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Jesus that was almost a classic Kings loss,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
"1 game down, 81 to go. The road to 81-1 continues.",qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Kardiac Kings are back baby,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Almost lost in Kangz fashion but Barnes kept us alive lmao,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
"Lmao that was such a bullshit avalanche of 3s there. We’ve got good shooters but that was insane. Great effort on defense despite giving up 121 lol thank god we won, it was a fun game and a good performance. Davion and some of these guys can play defense man I’m excited.",qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Ok ok ok hear me out: we end the season now and start playoffs…,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers

But hey, we won! Davion stays undefeated!",qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Bagley’s camp in shambles.,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
CJ has the ability to be a first option.  Stop discrediting him.  He and Dame is not a good fit but that doesn't mean CJ isn't lethal in his own ways.  Tonight he showed up once again his versatility in offense.,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
lol,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
That’s a bad shot,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
worst officiating ive ever seen in my life,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Let's go 1-0 every day baby!,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Dame Playing 40 minutes in first game back while everyone else is under 40 . and being probably one of the worse players for the blazers tonight. Should have gone to cj more he was cooking .,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Kings are good when MB is on the bench. Story of past few years,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers

Ah yes everyone get your fake dame trades ready,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Barnes is so good now he doesn’t have to be worried ab being traded while on the bench,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
I smell a McCollum for Simmons trade if he keeps balling...,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
That was the most stressful win I have ever had the pleasure to watch,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
We look like literally the same team as last year. I have no expectations for this team to do any thing.,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers

He gone,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
"As usual Kings blowing 20 point leads, practically giving the game away and the blazers still couldn't take it. lmfao",qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Dame in playoff form already,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Kings going to be kings. lmao,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
"horrible turnover by Haliburton, and horrible shot by Dame to end it. And also Luke Walton subbing in Davion Mitchell for Haliburton just because he made that mistake. If those guys aren't mature about that, it could cause a rift, especially because they're young guys essentially playing the same position. 

Weird win, but I guess a win is a win for them.",qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
Lame Time,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers
So weird how dame missed that,qcjlx8,Sacramento Kings,Portland Trail Blazers

It's 4-1 now. Nuggets in 9.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
How the fuck Jokic end the game with 0 FTAs???,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Jokic could have put up bigger numbers if he wanted to. I'm so happy Nuggets basketball is back!,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"suns with cp and devin going 5 mins without a fg is pretty insane 

ayton shooting threes tryna get that bag lmao",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Jokic was not backing down Ayton and using his inside game at all tonight.  Whats up with that.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Will Barton looked so great that game. It's crazy what being healthy does to a player.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Nuggets are the real deal when Murray comes back,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns

Joker was +28 tonight,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Man I cannot wait until we get Murray back out there...,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
We could build a new stadium with all the bricks the Suns made in the 3rd and 4th Q… Horrible second half,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Big Honey starting his MVP re-election campaign off strong.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns

Jokes aside, legit great game from our side, and we'll hold our munders high tonight.",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
My biggest concern is that Bones didn't play a single second.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"5 assists from MPJ, LETS GOOOO",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
It's just an MVP diff,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Jokic a monster,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Nuggets in 9 baby,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
By the best available numbers we have I think this means the Nuggets are going undefeated and the Suns will be winless.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns

When was the last time a top 4 seed with a reigning MVP opened the season as a seven point dog? WE STILL HAVE JOKIC.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"Theres so much toxicity in this thread between nuggs and suns fans, even the announcers mentioned some kind of nuggets suns rivalry but I can't wrap my head around it. I just can't hate another smallish market western conference team that home grows all their stars and tries to remain competitive (can't remember them tanking ever) despite not being afforded the advantage of other teams. If you asked me the other team in the west who i wanted to make the finals and who I thought had the best chance to do so it would be them.",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"Wow can’t believe everyone on the Suns just couldn’t shoot. Blow up the roster, trade everyone and tank for the number 1 pick.",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
M,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Damn wish we coulda grabbed one from the Nugs with Murray out cuz they gonna be real scary when he's back lol,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Wait didn't Jokic say that the Nuggets will lose in the next game. What a liar.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
whew,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"this really would have been a fun series with just a healthy thrill, MPJ and dozier, forget Murray. Fuck injuries man.

MVP hasnt missed a beat and Mike has a new bag",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
We have guards again I love it,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Nuggets are going to be  a good defensive team this year. Gordon is very good. Dozier is also good...and Campazzo is the ultimate hustle and make you mad guy. He makes a lot of steals and creates  a lot of turnovers.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Nuggets in 9,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns

Nothing better than seeing cp3 lose,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
When the Nuggets get Murray back this team is going to be incredible.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Healthy Barton Dozier healthy. Green will be  a big contributor. ..Nuggets still a powerhouse even without Murray. I hope they stay healthy till he returns. This team will be unstoppable IMO.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"I harbor no hate for the Suns, y’all are an awesome team.

But damn that felt good after the asswhooping y’all gave us in the playoffs lol.",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns

Oof Suns have to play healthy teams again,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns

"Jokic continuing where he left off in the WCSF, carrying his team. This time he had help.",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Nuggets where 12-3 I believe with Gordon and Murray both last season.  Good dreams for later in the season.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Need to score more points and give up less points,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"Nuggets second unit needs to pick it up. 

Good comeback in the 2nd half by the Nuggets though",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns

CP0,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"Suns fans coping with the loss on Twitter by saying ""Suns in 4"" is the peak cringe content I was waiting for. Good game though.",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns

"All good Sun brothers, just game 1 of the season....",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"I don’t hate CP3 and my team isn’t in the West or the Pacific division but seeing how much hate he gets after losing is just incredible to me.

Almost as much hate as when Lebron loses.",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
i stopped watching after the first half and the nuggets made a comeback. you're welcome nugget fans!,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Jae Crowder can only shoot vs the Lakers,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Jokic doing MVP kind of things. Down the stretch 8 straight points to keep Denver with a 7-11 point lead. to put away any doubt.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"that was a dreadful 4th quarter from the Suns, they couldn't beat the Nuggets's bench unit.  
Wil Barton has gigantic balls, he took some overly confident shots lmao",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns

It looks like God chose the Cardinals.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
Hard to beat a good team 5 times in a row,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
nuggets played like garbage and still won easily,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
"This game would’ve been a perfect example for anyone who thought that Ayton didn’t deserve a max (which btw isn’t me). Dude started off super hot, and then did nothing of note for three quarters of the game. He also got destroyed by Jokic on offense, and the whole basis of him earning a max contract is that he can make life difficult for bigs of that caliber.",qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
I have a theory that they let jokic get away with so many offensive fouls that they dont call defensive fouls on him to make up for it,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
I love the nuggets. I didn't want to sweep them. It was really mean of us.,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns
half the league was chucking tonight,qcjj5a,Denver Nuggets,Phoenix Suns

"Obviously Luka was terrible today, but if this was any indication of how the offense will look this season, it's gonna be brutal. From watching literally the most efficient offense of all time to back-to-back possessions of Dorian Finney-Smith postups (had more tonight than the entirety of last season btw) in a matter of 2 years...

Yeah, of course it's not feasible for Luka to have a billion % usage every game, but trying to tone it down with essentially running back the same roster they've had for the third year in a row that's already shown is incalaple of doing it just is trying to cure the symptom, and not the actual disease. Cuban even fucking said in an interview before the offseason that the main goal was to bring in another ball-handler, and yet this massive glaring issue was not addressed at all. Luka and Dragic were almost begging to play together in the media, but they couldn't even get that done, instead they got in two spot-up shooters, who cannot even do that, because their spacing is fucking horrendous now.",qd6jcz,Dallas Mavericks,Atlanta Hawks

I don't wanna keep up the hate train on Lloyd Pierce cause /r/AtlantaHawks can do that shit on their own but man Cam Reddish looks like a completely different dude with him gone lol. He might've got cut by the guangdong tigers preseason roster the way his rookie year looked and now he's been looking solid tonight and in the Bucks series. Small sample size yea but the growth is obvious,qd6jcz,Dallas Mavericks,Atlanta Hawks
"I think the conclusion that should actually be drawn from this game is that the Hawks have a disgustingly powerful pair of young wings that managed to keep Doncic in check while still providing offense at the position. 

Cam is probably going to get moved at some point, but as of right now his value seems to be trending in a directly inverse relationship to Ben Simmons so it might be a stomachable loss if we get a haul back(I don't want to lose Cam though, it's just....not feasible to lock literally everyone up. But fuck feasability, I want to keep Cam AND De'andre.)


Dieng trebuchet'ing that 3 was one of the highlights of the night for me. Us having a big man with a shot to back up Capela adds even more wrinkles to an already dynamic offense and the bench was lovin' it.",qd6jcz,Dallas Mavericks,Atlanta Hawks
It's amazing how one simple coaching change unlocked the Hawks' potential.,qd6jcz,Dallas Mavericks,Atlanta Hawks
"This was just a massive team difference. Trae and Luka both had an awful 1st half and both had good 2nd halfs. They evened out.

But our team is so damn incredibly deep compared to the Mavs. We still have Lou Will, Gallo, and OO that are out.

"Random Thoughts

Luka and Trae seem to be struggling to adjust to the new rules, arent used to so much perimeter contact, since guys arent scared of getting called for fouls on flops, both need to learn how to play through the contact better

ATL is stupidly deep, deepest team in the East imo, even with Trae having an off shooting night they're obliterateing the Mav

Capela's really worked himself into a nice player, plays within himself, doesnt try too do too much, does his job well, really great find for ATL

Dallas's offense is too Luka centric, when hes off it just grinds to a fucking halt,  Dallas desperately needs secondary playmakers, both to take the pressure off Luka being the sole initiator and run the offense when Luka sits

KP's lateral quickness is just gone, dudes a statue out there

Its one game, but im not enthralled with Kidd as a coach atm, offense and defense just look atrocious and dated",qd6jcz,Dallas Mavericks,Atlanta Hawks

Decided to watch Dune tonight instead. Happy with my decision it seems,qd7g24,Milwaukee Bucks,Miami Heat
Shout out the heat for coming out with so much energy when the crowd was dead af at the start. You could tell they were big bad from last season. Bucks couldn't match it at the start and gave up when the wide open threes didn't drop. GG,qd7g24,Milwaukee Bucks,Miami Heat

"Enjoy that one Heat fans, we will meet again.",qd7g24,Milwaukee Bucks,Miami Heat
Middleton and Giannis combined was outscored by Herro LMAO,qd7g24,Milwaukee Bucks,Miami Heat
"Bucks fans: I am sorry we did that to you. But I’ll be honest, if you sons of bitches keep saying you were “missing” players to injury I’m not going to feel bad. You know who had a lot of injuries that you didn’t seem to notice? The Heat team you beat last season. We still don’t have Oladipo, imagine if we’d had him last night, lol. If you genuinely believe having Holiday and 33 year old Lopez would have changed a damn thing, you’re delusional. That was one of the most complete and devastating ass kicking I’ve ever seen. I was wholly convinced",qd7g24,Milwaukee Bucks,Miami Heat
Bucks down three starters and heat in a revenge game. Not surprised.,qd7g24,Milwaukee Bucks,Miami Heat
Is Giannis washed??,qd7g24,Milwaukee Bucks,Miami Heat

Is Steph Curry really a top 75 player if he can't maintain his 1st quarter performance and finish the game with 100 points on 36/36 shooting and 20/20 from 3??,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Warriors won but that turnovers almost cost them the game. Gotta minimize that,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
This season is going to be so fucking good.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
This was my first in person Warriors game. I picked a good game.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
CURRY IS A MONSTER,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
I somehow feared Reggie Jackson the most despite being cold all game,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Not even mad. We didn't give up. Warriors are gonna be near the top of the west this year,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"That felt like a vintage 14-16 warriors season. Steph fucks the sky, the full draymond experience, Iguodala making the right plays, and turnovers nearly losing us the game. Only thing that broke it was the third quarter",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
All these dudes are so damn good at basketball wtf,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
This is gonna be one of the best seasons ever,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers

I am concerned about the Chase floor, there were a whole lot of slips tonight. Hopefully they look into it and make any required changed going forwards.",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"The West should be worried about the Clippers and Warriors....they both have the ability to make it through the West. 


And both are missing their star players...Pacific division 2nd round is totally possible.",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Clips still look really solid without Kawhi.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"Felt like a playoff game, fuck Curry is amazing",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
WHAT A GAME,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Clippers look stronger than we thought,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Damn the Warriors 2-0 after a terrible Curry shooting night and 21 turnovers against both LA teams? They might be back,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
The league just didn’t feel the same without the Warriors playing at this level.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"Since my last PGT comment was negative I’m gonna go in the opposite direction here:

Shout out to Ty Lue, man. I guess we can never really know how much coaching goes on in between quarters and at half time but who woulda thought that the young fish faced man with a perpetually confused look on his face that took over for David Blatt would end up being such a good coach. His teams always seem to defend well and on top of that they never seem to be out of games. He’s going to have a very long very successful career for however long he wants.

Also lol, this was such a Steph Curry game. Go absolutely nuclear, let his foot off the gas and get a little lackadaisical, throw the ball away a bunch of times then close the game down with some timely 3’s and FT’s.",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"We lost, but fuck it. I’m hyped for this team.",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Disappointed we didn’t get OT I could go for 5 more minutes of that. Playoff intensity in tip off week I love it,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Inject this shit into my veins. Insane game!,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Curry gonna win MVP this year.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Really wish we won that. PG13 kept us alive in that game!,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
wow great performance by both teams. PG is clutch for hitting that last 3 but Curry just on demon time this entire game,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Man both of these teams are gonna be great to watch. Warriors resurgent and Clippers still being dogs with both Steph and PG possibly gunning for MVP by April,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Less turnovers pls.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Steph since ~2014 has been an absolute treasure to watch. Draymond was 100% correct in saying that Steph doesn't really get the credit he deserves.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Worth staying up for. Skyfucker is on another level.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"Fair play to the Clippers and PG, that was a hell of an effort 

Incredible game to watch",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Skyfucker did the thing again,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
If Steph goes over 30 ppg again and the Warriors sneak into a top 4 seed I don't think anybody would have a shot at the MVP over em.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Okay but that game was fucking great. GG skyfucker,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
George impact on this game was great his numbers didn't do him any justice.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Both these teams are contenders once they get their injured players back.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"I wish they'd stop switching the camera to Klay all the time. The man is clearly depressed or just not feeling. Last year he was smiling, laughing, and clapping on the bench but now he looks morose every time they switch to him",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers

Man thought all 3 games were gonna be blow outs. What a game this one turned out to be!,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
What a fun game to watch. Curry is just absolutely unreal.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
We truly are blessed to get to watch a player like a Curry in our lifetime.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
great thing about hd cameras is I saw the light leaving Reggie Jackson's eyes even with those glasses,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"The Warriors have already beaten both LA teams (albeit the clippers without Kawhi), without Klay, Wiseman and Kuminga. 

The offense is just flowing so well with Iggy, Bjelica and others instead of Oubre, Bazemore and Wanamaker. Lot of assist. Lot of turnovers so far too but as chemistry gets better there’ll be less. 

Steph has a triple double and a 45 point game. Still an MVP candidate 

Draymond is his usual self and looks more confident going to the basket. 

When they get the injured players back…watch out for the WCF.",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Steph for MVP,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Calling it now. If Klay comes back healthy this warriors team is gonna go the distance.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Both these teams are so fun and good imo,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"We had a chance down to the last second. Sad about the L, can’t be mad about it though. This clips team has no quit. 

Missed too many shots. Also need to never blow three team fouls in 3 seconds again. Missed batum out there but I liked everything I saw. We feel like an actual well built team rather then just a really talented one. 

Good game warriors fans. Your stadium was bumping. Glad we made you fight for it",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Steph is always a joy to watch. GG warrior bros.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers

Crazy how Curry shot 16-25 with that 0-7 run in the middle... he was insane outside of that small chunk lmao,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Ain’t nothing better than a Stephen Curry masterclass performance man I tell you… some of the most fun basketball you’ll witness because the team and fans feed off that crazy ass energy and it makes the Warriors SUPER dangerous,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"Curry's both dagger 3s to ice the game as usual against the Clippers was wild and all I could think was Curry probably thinking

"MAMA, THERE GOES THAT MAN",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Clippers look a lot better than I expected without Ibaka or Kawhi. Some of that was us not having a rim protector but they just have so many good veteran role players and Ty Lue is a great coach. Gonna keep an eye on them this year,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers

"Wow, talk about ups and downs.

The Warriors looked unbeatable. Then they looked like last year's team. 

Clippers have a lot of heart. With their athleticism, they're legitimately dangerous. Easy to see how they came back in the playoffs last year. 

During the Curry era, every so often, this has happened: an athletic-as-hell, physical team pushes the Warriors off their game. Happened in the play-ins last year. Memphis and the Cavs did it in the 2015 playoffs. At their best, the Warriors adjust, figure it out. 

Tonight I don't know if they did or if Curry just remembered that he could hit 40 footers.",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Steph's on pace to average 10 rebounds a game.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
Curry on pace for a double-double with rebounds season.,qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers
"How do you go 9-9 in the first quarter and then 7-16 over the next 3 quarters? Steph only finished the game with 25 shots. F*vking Jordan Poole here wasting so many possessions with 4-14 shots and 7 turnovers. That's 21 possessions where he only successfully converted on 4. Pass the damn ball to Steph and get out of the way man. With the way he was shooting, Steph could easily have went for 60+ tonight if his team just got out of his way.",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers

"A hat tip to Steph. That man is a straight-up sniper.

Either way, I can't be too bummed about my Clips losing tonight. The fact they made a game and nearly taking it shows they're prepped this season, whether Kawhi makes it or not. Pleased with Bledsoe's return and T-Mann and Reggie picking up where they left off. George still proving the doubters wrong.",qd9f6l,Golden State Warriors,Los Angeles Clippers

Lots of cool stuff, exciting stuff, but mostly it's just crazy that LMA retired with heart problems after a couple games with us last season and now he's back with us and doing what he did tonight.  

KD triple double, Mills 3s, Dinwiddie back on the court elsewhere and playing awesome, champ Brook Lopez buying goofy paintings, love to see it all.  Now onto the home opener Sunday!

We are going to be so much more exposed for our late game playmaking without Simmons there to defend the other team's playmakers.",qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers
The only thing Doc challenges is Ben’s effort in practice,qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers

wow the sixers could really benefit from another perimeter defender. maybe someone who is eager to facilitate the ball as well,qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers

Hilarious that Sixers fans were calling this outcome at halftime.,qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers
Philadelphia is the only city that can lead the nets for the whole game and then not score at all in the last 5 minutes,qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers
refs can actually eat dick for that one.  bad all night and not sure ive ever seen more fucked up calls in the last two minutes than that. if they get that charge or out of bounds right or if doc ever learns what a challenge is we win this.  also danny like...you cant airball three shots in a row homie. great game and ends like that. what a joke.,qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers
Sorry haters,qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers
"Refs are fucking trash. Doc should’ve challenged but at the same time he shouldn’t fucking have to. Clear as day calls. And Embiid gets hacked and they swallow the whistle? Absolute horseshit 


We choked. Doc sucked. But this is a recurring theme in the NBA. Tomorrow they’ll release some bullshit 2 minute report showing all the calls that fucked us as a “we’re sorry”. But then no ref is held accountable. And nothing changes. 

Brutal league",qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers

But damn good game nets,qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers
"Huge comeback win for the Nets...its shocking that the Sixers lost this. KD was KD and Aldridge saved their asses, along with Danny Green. Thank god, since Joe Harris is already in playoff form. 🙃

Still, I'm worried for them cuz the Sixers weren't even at full strength. Idk how they're gonna get out of the east having to go thru these guys and the Bucks again without Irving.",qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers
"Combination of bad calls by the refs (or good calls if you're BKN), missed challenges by Doc an good ol' Danny Green.

Nets had no business winning LOL",qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers
"Random thoughts

BRK defense is awful, their interior defense especially so, Claxton is cheeks rn, why they didnt sign a decent center this past offseason is beyond me

2 game sample size but BRK's offense looks better with Harden on the bench, big yikes atm and mildly concerning going forward

Joe Harris in playoff form rn

Patty Mills signing was one of the best offseason moves, dude brings shooting, perimeter D, and poise, all sorely needed 

Harden Iso become less effective when the defenders not worried about getting called for a ticky/flop foul

Hardens lack of off ball movement is a problem, gums up/kill a lot actions because he just floats around the top of the key 3 point line, needs to work on back cutting for ez layups when defenders overplay him

If Kyrie doesnt come back KD's gonna have to hard carry this team, talk about shit you wouldnt have expected to say to start the season

Millsap and LMA do the same things for this team, why they felt the need to get 2 dudes why they felt the need to get 2 players with so much overlap at a position that isnt super important (the stretch 4-5) is kinda headscratching.  Also BRK needs wings badly, theyves got too many 4-5's and 1-2's.  

LMA and Mills were the unsung heroes tonight, ex-Spurs carrying the Nets lmao

BRK has no answer for Embiid other than doubling/trapping on the perimeter or swarming him in the post
Maxey looks solid, some  youthful hiccups but i can see why they wanted to keep him, RIP to Simmons lol

Still baffled why Dallas traded Seth, dudes the perfect spacer for any team looking to go on a deep playoffs run, and hes continued to add to his game

Sixers have an actual bench this year,  they wont hemorrhage leads as much when Embiid sit now

Sixers biggest issue imo is consistency, they have a hard time sustaining good play and tend to bounce between good runs and bad runs, their closing play also leaves a lot too be desired, wrong guys taking the shots down the stretch, also wayyyyyyy too many execution errors on both sides of the ball",qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers
hopefully Philly doesn't take their anger on us later in the week,qdvnvq,Brooklyn Nets,Philadelphia 76ers

Nothing in this thread about BI posting an efficient 26/8/8.,qdvv3t,Chicago Bulls,New Orleans Pelicans
"Pelicans had three major issues last year, turnovers, defense, and end of game offense. It really feels like they managed to get worse on defense and turnovers, and maybe better at late game offense since they got JV. You just can't be a good team with the level of defense that they play, it's too easy to score against them and it'll be even worse when Zion comes back. I am not gonna harp on the Lonzo Ball stuff since no one is going to change their minds at this point, but I feel like they really could have used his 0 turnovers, 3 steals and overall defensive intensity/size. 

On a bright note it seems like the starting guards can hit their threes so far based off of the games played this year, they're gonna have another amazing offensive team yet again this year, but can you even sniff the playoffs with that kind of defense? Not like Lonzo was a lock down defender though, the issue really stems from BI and Zion and their lack of a defensive center.  

I just find it hard to believe that they'll just outscore everyone into the playoffs especially when they're going to struggle with turn overs all year long. Either Green is some sort of defensive wizard that'll turn them into a good defensive team, BI needs to fucking step-up on defense alongside Zion, or else it just feels like it'll be last year all over again for them.",qdvv3t,Chicago Bulls,New Orleans Pelicans

A LOT more illegal screens called on Spurs, I would very much like that this is standard for other games as well, I'm afraid, however, that this was just an exception.

Why tf can't players say to their coach that they should challenge the call, in the end I think Morris just loste the ball, went out of bounds and it was somehow Nuggets ball.",qdwvwc,Denver Nuggets,San Antonio Spurs

"We gave up far too many open shots, Nuggets could've scored 120 easily if their open 3s went in. 20 turnovers is way too much, although Nuggets weren't much better in both departments though. We have stretches where everything is going well, but some stretches where we play defense like some high school team. We're not a great 3pt shooting team and that's why we exactly need our shooters (Forbes and Doug) to shoot well and they shot 1/6 from 3. If they can't shoot, there's no justification to keep them in the game for too long given that they are bad defenders as well.

Keldon played excellently. White was pretty good, Dj played well and made some key buckets in the end of the first quarter when momentum was on Denver's side, but it seems that he still doesn't have a reliable 3pt shot and it's been now a few years that us Spurs fans were hoping that he finally develops it as it can turn into a problem (when he paased up an open 3 at the end of the game). Poeltl was good as well, but I wish he gets more respect from the refs (2 bullshit quick fouls in the first few minutes). Others didn't really show up.",qdwvwc,Denver Nuggets,San Antonio Spurs

He's a detriment to himself...I don't know any other player in NBA history where the only downside to the player IS THEMSELVES. Like literally, guy like Kyrie-him not playing is the issue, Joel's health, Zion's weight, Westbrook being WESTBROOK is only the issue. It never seems to be like...at the end of the season when you need them most Westbrook being Westbrook will win you any kind of games. No. Its gonna be what it was last night.*

Stalled up the court so bad we still lost to a Warriors team with 2015 Euroleague MVP Bjelica out there like he had something to lift, playing like he had a purpose. I don't understand that.*

>*When Stephen Curry is playing bad, Westbrook plays worse. I don't get it. I don't understand his mindset. I don't understand how this man's brain functions. I don't wanna wait. I don't wanna wait it through seeking out anything.  I've seen what I have to see. I'm good. I don't want it. The [expletive] doesn't learn.*

>*He can't shoot. He still can't shoot. I'd much rather have Ben Simmons right now. I'd rather have a [expletive]  that's out there playing D, playmaking, refusing to miss a shot than have Westbrook at this point. Westbrook shooting is like turning the ball over. A Westbrook shot is equivalent to a turnover at this point. I don't like it.*

The Suns haven't completely gelled yet, and Booker isn't quite in game shape after Covid, but that is a well built team. And they went and addressed their biggest issue with McGee. 

With the Lakers...for whatever reason, teams forget that the ability to shoot is the most important skill in the game. And they've got one shooter who came in during garbage time. 

While the Suns have a young team with a sprinkle of vet leadership in Jae and CP3...the Lakers have a geriatric team. 

While the Suns know their roles because the team has been built where the roles are obvious...the Lakers are gonna need to figure them out. 

All the names got people excited, but people were looking at the parts, not the whole. And although I expect them to get a lot better if they buy into Vogel's defensive scheme..it's gonna be hard af to make the offense any better, and it's just gonna be a lot of PnR and ISO. If this team was collectively ten years younger, they could be a great transition team - but they can't do that at this point in their career.

I didn’t get a chance to watch the game tonight, but as a devout /r/nba follower, I know that the Suns can only beat the Lakers when Lebron and AD are injured. Anyone have an update on their status? Praying for a speedy recovery for my two favorite Lakers 🙏🏾",qdxw4k,Phoenix Suns,Los Angeles Lakers

"I just don’t know what the Lakers were thinking with this roster. They could’ve had Buddy Hield. I also would have much rather had Caruso and KCP than all the role players they added. Nobody on this team plays defense except for AD, Dwight, and Lebron when he tries. It is still the Lakers and they’ll probably be somewhat alright, but I do wonder how this defense improved.",qdxw4k,Phoenix Suns,Los Angeles Lakers
"I know everyone is going to meme this game for different reasons, but man, DeAndre Jordan cannot play any significant minutes. It would be perfect if AD could just play the 5 and Dwight sub him in for 12 min a game.

"Our average margin of defeat to Utah last year was like 28, so I'm pleased with the effort. Fox looked like he was hurting after taking a shot from Gobert. I think we win if he played even average.

We hit 8 threes all game. 2 from Barnes in the first few minutes and then 6 from Buddy. You can't win in the modern NBA shooting like that, but the fact we were even in it until late was a testament to our defensive improvement.

Davion is legit. Still super raw offensively, but he brings the CLAMPS. Nice to see Haliburton playing more freely too after a poor first game.",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
Too many turnovers against an elite team. We fought hard but we shot ourselves in the foot too many times to win this game.,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"That game was physical and frustrating and they’re just straight up better than us lol proud of how they played tonight though, very good effort defensively and stayed aggressive, just horrible shooting night (Jazz defense does not help) and sloppy passing (Jazz defense does not help). 

Extremely impressed with Davion tonight man. Still got a lot to figure out with the rookie mistakes, but the defensive highlight reel is gonna be something from him tonight. 

Also Richaun fouling out and only getting 17 minutes because of it hurt a lot, he was great in that short amount of time. 

I hate playing Rudy Gobert and I hate how good the Jazz are lol",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"Davion Mitchell has got me SPOOKED.

Who IS this guy?",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz

I hear Davion Mitchell pees sitting down because he has clamps for hands.,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"The real turning point of the game was Bagley getting hunted at the end of the 3rd and the Jazz went on a run. Then refball at the beginning of the 4th. After that we lost all momentum and had to crawl our way back with Holmes in foul trouble.

People are gonna blame Buddy for that awful pass and rightfully so, but TD had some really dumb plays throughout the game.

Pleasantly surprised to get so many compliments from the Jazz broadcast team, especially on our defensive effort.",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
Davion Mitchell is the real deal,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz

Those Baylor Bears had a real team last year,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz

What a miserable win,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
Rudy gobert has been a fucking monster so far,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"At least we didn’t get blown out by the Jazz like last time, now that’s improvement. Fox needs to drop a banger shooting wise, and for the love of god cut Bagley lmao",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"We may have lost, but holy shit, we fucking bullied the Jazz. The Kings were one of the softest teams defensively last year and we just pushed them around and knocked like 200 balls loose in the paint. 

Shame about Holmes fouling out so easily, it ended up costing us the game. But man, I'm feeling good!",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"8/36 from the 3, how was it even close",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
Yo.. the battles of D Mitchell was fun. Davion is the real deal. Kings have absolutely slayed the last 2 late lottery picks.,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"Raining long 2's and floaters fucked Rudy and Jazz in the first half.  
2nd half is JC's revenge quarter + Hield's bad plays didn't help.",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
Horrible passes throughout the game is why the kings lost. So many unforced turnovers. Also fox played his worst game in quite a while,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
Seriously impressed by davion mitchell's defense. If only he can improve his offense.,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
Fuck was that a bad game from the Kings there in the 2nd half (missed the first half). Just throwing the ball towards the basket through like 2-3 guys over and over and over again hoping that it goes in or something. Refs also seemed to be letting it get kinda too physical a lot of the time.,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz

"Hope the kings keep playing hard this year, could be a fun team",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"Fucking terrible game to watch.

Refs were disgustingly bad, one of the worst-reffed games I've seen in a while and the Kings almost got one straight stolen by the refs just two days ago. No rhythm at all. Called every little tick-tack call on the Kings while letting Fox get mugged every play. Ejected Ingles on a play that had no business being called a flagrant 2 (1 yes, by the book). Removed Richuan Holmes from the game entirely on total horseshit calls all game long (he was fucking *heated* in that game; I've never seen Holmes so mad in my life - think that says something?). I think *twice* they called 3 fouls on the Kings in 1 possession? Missed calls on the other end from time to time as well like Fox out of bounds on the baseline. Extremely inconsistent all-around and downright embarrassing for the NBA.

Meanwhile the Kings shot 20% from 3 on extremely high volume. Fox had the worst shooting night I may have ever seen from him, missing every single thing in the paint. ***The turnovers.*** Kings had 15 turnovers and I'd wager at least 12 of them were ***completely unforced.***

On the positive side, the Kings were in the game until the last minute despite all of the sheer fuckery the whole game. Against a really fuckin good Jazz team. If they just cut out some of those horrifically dumb, mind-boggling turnovers and actually hit a couple shots here and there, they win that. Their defense is massively improved this season, thanks in no small part to Davion but with just higher effort and communication all around.

Bagley is still dead weight on both ends, whadd'ya know. No wonder he wasn't in the rotation game 1, he's right about the 10th guy on the bench.",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"I love Whiteside, there..i said it. fuck off",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"Some goddamn awful officiating, on both sides. Missed calls, late calls, and an extremely questionable objection on Ingles. All in all it was a great game but could have been amazing had the refs not constantly fucked it up.",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
i miss you trade package Buddy + Barnes :(,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
Whiteside got his revenge!,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
"Weird but true, Fox is playing the worst out of the Kings guards rn. Huge fan of his hope he gets back to form. Haliburton looked good and Mitchell had the best 1-8 shooting game ever",qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
on Fox and his play in the clutch - I honestly don't think his style of play is conductive to clutch basketball. Every time i see him he either defers or makes bad decisions due to mainly poor shooting ability and even open midrange looks like a bad shot. Reminds me of Russ post 2016 where he stuffs the stat sheet before the 4th quarter then starts bricking,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
Agent of Chaos,qdxv64,Sacramento Kings,Utah Jazz
Evan Mobley with 17/11 and 4 blocks in his third professional game 👀,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
"
Evan Mobley had 17/10/4 with 4 minutes left in the 3rd. 

you'd think he did nothing for the rest of the game after ending with 17/11/4, but watching it, he was still impactful all over the place. Keeps the ball moving, switches on defense, has nutty handles for his size and can move with anyone on the court... he's going to be a massive problem",qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
What are we like 1-3 or 1-4 against the Cavs over the past two seasons? GG...,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
Ricky Rubio is my king. Also Evan Mobley is the best rookie we've had in so goddamn long,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers

Evan Mobley is my religion,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
Mobley is the truth,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
The Hawks let the Cavs go on a 21-0 run at one point this game. That's just not ok.,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
"That third quarter was disgusting, man.",qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
Jarrett Allen missed 4 shots what a scrub,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers

Mobley is very good,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
"The Cavs are getting a little frisky. Daresay... spooky?

Mobley ROTY

Rubio MIP

Even though the shots aren't going in yet, I've liked the game over game improvement we're seeing from Markkanen. The effort is there, he's playing hard and not losing his confidence.

Minor sub-plot for the Cavs this year: is Kevin Love finally buying in to being the vet/mentor we've wanted him to be the last 3 years? Early returns are positive!",qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers

Absolutely pathetic from the Hawks,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
Hawks looked really sloppy tonight. Fouled a lot and the shot selection was subpar,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
A win very happy. Starting to feel that the Cavs need to choose between Garland or Sexton because of consistency.,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
The Cleveland Skyline seems to be actually working,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
Hope this is equivalent exchange. I hope the Braves win tonight!!!!,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
I was sure the Hawks were gonna win this one and turned it off during halftime. I specifically remember how the Cavs can’t stop the play that ends with a free throw line jumper and the Hawks ran it over and over. But I’m also glad Rubio is on my fantasy team. He looks like Jesus with that beard and hair,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
Refs really wanted the hawks to make that comeback. Good shit Cavs🤞🏽,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
"Evan Mobley is nice as fuck. Hes what I expected Ayton to look like. rubio had an amazing game. Idc if I get 10000 downvotes and flamed for this, a fairly refereed game and it isnt a tight win for Cleveland. That was absolutely shambolic, so bad to the point I genuinely wondered if refs dont bet on outcomes of games but make prop bets on free throws & fouls. gg to cleveland my beef is with the refs tonight. The free throw disparity doesn't do justice to just how ridiculous and one sided this refereeing  was. At one point they called a foul on the hawks 3 or 4 possessions in a row while not calling fouls for the hawks on drives to the rim. Also, three 7 footers running a zone is so OP idk how youd even score on that",qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
Man the Cavs roster is really testing my knowledge of NBA players.  I'm like 90 percent positive I've played 2k rec with half of the end of the bench dudes on their team.,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers

We played liked shit but also some really suspect officiating.,qeh7ns,Atlanta Hawks,Cleveland Cavaliers
"Atlanta exploded last year after injuries from Hunter and Reddish. The two of them have a tunnel vision and Reddish is literally one of the worst in the entire league in fg%. They are much better without the two of them and that will be seen this season. The problem is that the two of them suffocate Bogdanovic with their selfishness.

">Here's your Dallas Mavs Post Game Summary. Now in our 6th Season. 6️⃣

Did the Mavs win? ✅ First win of the season to keep our sub from imploding any further...

Kidd's first win as the new Mavs Head Coach 📋🏆

Yo Raps got themselves a gem in Scottie 🦖

Luka with a near triple double finishing with 27/9/12. Started slow but managed to get things going in the 2nd half. 👍🇸🇮

TIMMY! After having some historically abysmal shooting performances against Toronto in the past, dude had himself a night with 25pts off of 7 3's 🔥👌💦 

KP looked a tad better tonight compared to last night with 18/10 double double to go with a whopping 4 blocks. Hopefully his shooting progressing back to the mean soon🦄🇱🇻✋🧱✋✋✋✋

Powell with 11pts going a perfect 3/3 from the field 7️⃣💯

Doe Doe lastly joined the rest of the starting 5 in double digits with 11/8 👍👍

We allowed some careless fouls and runs there at the end that kept things close but thankfully for us the clock became our teammate by then. Hopefully we don't have such a slow start against Houston on Tuesday 🚀",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Why does Luka stars this bad from 3 every year,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Dallas should've blown their lead like the old days imo 😅,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
I'll take the win but it'd be cool if we could make a wide open 3,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
yo give us dragic,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Scottie Barnes is legit,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"We’ll get them next time, boys 🥲",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Luka always kills us but unfortunately THJ also killed us tonight.,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
GG Raptors!,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"When Tim Hardaway Jr is on fire, he's on *Fire*. It felt like he was using hacks.",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
I'm starting to somehow believe in Flight's hyping of Scottie,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Don't let this loss distract you from the fact that Scottie Barnes is the ROTY frontrunner,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"You know if our offense can be as good as it was from the 2nd quarter on, then I won’t have to contemplate drinking during Mavs games this season",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Still can't tell if Jkidd is a good coach.. Luka and Hardaway just went nuclear lol.,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Goran cant guard for shit, his minutes should be restricted hard.  PG duties should go to Trent when VanVleet is resting",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Luka is nuts. Our offence was ass in the second half. Also, Scottie ROTY, but unironically",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Everyone should go watch the 3 Scottie Barnes plays where he just stronk’d through or blew by Luka.,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Luka ran the offense 2nd half and that pretty much was the game from there.

Don't wanna see Luka off ball like that until we get a good 2ndary ball handler.",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Scottie is UNIRONICALLY the ROTY,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Vintage Luka is back, y'all",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Scottie with a plus +7 but the fouls (some were not deserved imo) and the thigh bang kept him out the game, could have used him.",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
One of those games (back-to-back with travel and Mavs coming off a bad loss) that I expected to lose but they gave me hope until they started slowing down.,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Just give up on getting stronger, if Kristaps can get his ball handling back to his rookie skills challenge winning days he will be a fringe-all star player.",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Definitely need Yuta and Pascal back, the wing depth without those guys to fill in isn’t there, and both guys are getting tired, defence slipped as the game went.",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Luka Doncic is the real deal. I cant believe Phoenix Suns passed on this guy. Worst blunder ever.


Edit: Scarcramento Queengs",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
I’m not giving this to Kidd,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Only comebacks are allowed whenever Dallas plays in Toronto.,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Our defenders are so physical. Other teams are going to hate us,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"We shouldnt have been doubling Luka in the 2nd half, it was just free buckets for dallas. Also refs called stupid shit on my boy OG smh",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"I couldn’t watch but I’m surprised to see Birch is head of Boucher in Toronto’s rotation, what’s goin on with that?",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Mavs were better.,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Mavs sub in shambles when they can’t cry about Kidd or KP,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
That was one of the most toxic gamethreads I've ever seen...for an early regular season game of all things lol,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Good defense, held the Raptors to 44 2nd half points. Good bounce back in the second half, KP with 18/10 and 4 blocks. I wasn’t thrilled with the Kidd hiring, but new coach, GM, and assistants (we lost Mosley too) means we need time to gel, especially with a couple new rotation guys too. We need to wait 20 games before having some concrete evaluation. And we have a pretty light schedule at first, onto the next!",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
But I thought our season was over after game 1 guys wtf!!!,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Did Luka & THJ only play on the floor together tonight? Are they a tandem now?,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Tonight's takeaways:

Despite keeping Luka at 2/10 from three, he still cooked us. But also it's Luka so it's nothing I wasn't expecting.

I feel for Mavs fans. Despite winning, I'd be ripping my hair out watching this team with Kidd coaching.

Achiuwa/OG/Fred/Barnes were all awesome. Barnes in particular is the real deal. 

Our entire bench was disappointing tonight. Flynn not getting any minutes was a head scratcher.

This was the prototypical GTJ game I was expecting after dropping 20 the other night. I got shat on by Raps fans a month ago for saying this is the usual for him.

Achiuwa being able to step in for Birch and vice versa when one is struggling is a breath of fresh air for our C depth. Nothing of the JV/Ibaka/Gasol days, but still a breath of fresh air.

The fan asking Luka to sign their Raptors jersey is a walking L.

Overall a rough outing, but at the same time most of our main guys stepped up the way we needed them to tonight.",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"T offense was absolute garbage on the 1st half and then we went back to the Carlisle Luka heliocentric offense of last season and things started to click.

Those stepbacks from the right wing were hard to watch but Luka played an overall good game. And Timmy took over still our 2nd best player.",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"We had this until we had to take OG and Barnes out and left Doncic free to warm up.

Hard not to feel the refs calling the Raps hard and fast initially (and not the Mavs) really hurt our ability to keep up the fight.


Our offense is still rough as hell though. Might need Trevor to poke at Nurse’s offense a bit more.",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
KP statpadding at the end lmao,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
The Raptors are one good player who can shoot away from being a real problem.,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Kidd: we can’t rely on 3 pointers to win game

Mavs: win by making 3 in the 2nd half",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Anyone else see GTJ hook the Mavs player arm when GTJ was falling down? That was a really dangerous play that they called a jump ball,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Don't let this win fool you, this team still sucks",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"~~Raptors fans, do you also think your announcers are annoying?~~

This wasn't a question, that one commentator is definitely annoying.",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
I was told Kidd ruined the offense and Mavericks would regress after one game though!!!!,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Random thoughts:

Luka needs to work on his offseason conditioning (and defense), cuz his current fitness is just fucking unacceptable for a player of his caliber

KP is a fucking statue, his defensive limitations will determine how far Dallas can go in the playoffs, because playoff caliber teams will abuse the shit outta him

Bullock should probably start in place of DFS, no knock on DFS but Bullock's skillset would probably fit the starting lineup better

Hardaway is such a hot and cold player, hes either 7-9 or 1-9, very little in-between, not a huge fan of high variance players like that, but when hes on they can beat damn near anybody

Dallas also has a C problem, Powells fine as an off the bench energy small-ball C, but isnt good enough too start, get bullied too easily, and his offensive game is too limited, WCS is just hot sweaty plumber ass, and Boban's really useful in certain matchups, completely useless in others, should probably look to acquire a C in buyout/by the deadline, and ship out WCS if they can

Klieber is the teams X-factor, needs more minutes, good stuff happens for the most part when hes on the court

It took Kidd 1.5 games to realize putting the ball in Lukas hand more is a good idea, this man and NBA head coach rofl, as an aside id like to see Dallas run a small ball closing lineup, with Luka-THJ-Bullock/DSF-DSF/Klieber-Powell/Klieber once Luka's drops weight.  

Torontos in a really weird spot teamwise, cant tell if they're gonna sell hard at the deadline or look to be buyers to make a playoff push, neither would surprise me, a lot probably hinges on OG's development, and whether or not he takes that next step

Toronto's D is legit, they will be a pain in the ass to play against all season, also Nick Nurse is a really good coach, TOR's lucky to have a guy like that. 

Scottie Barnes is legit, winning player, very savvy high bbiq, does lots of small things well, reminds me of young Iguodala

Toronto's bench was assssssss tonight, outside of Dragic, who quite frankly should play better than he did today, they seem pretty thin i atm

TF happened to Boucher?  Dude was and elite 2way player last year but looks absolutely lost on offense rn",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"This Kidd experiment survives another day, I guess...",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Toronto, you have the absolute worst announcers in pro sports. It sounds like you hired Tom Lichis as your color guy. What the fuck is that about?",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Hey Mavs, do you guys still want Dragic? Lol",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
blech,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Scottie for ROTY, that is all",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
[Luka's plan](https://kapwi.ng/c/km_y8kvkJl),qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
"Dallas was playing atrociously in the first half and we were shooting almost 50% from 3 but refs kept them in the game, complete turn around in the second half. 

Mavs probably close the gap either way THJ went full Stephy Curry and Luka got into his rhythm. 

Would be nice to have seen more of Scottie and OG in the second half too bad refs",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks

"Kidd And PorinzGodless should sign a co-contract in china. that 1st quarter was horrible, Porzingis post-fader Brickshow",qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks

Fire Jason Kidd because I don't like him.,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Easily the worst officiated game of the season. You have KP throwing people down to the ground by grabbing their necks with 0 calls but then foul out OG and Scottie  from breathing on KP. Not t a real loss by the raps imo.,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Toronto fell off hard since losing kawhi daym,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Kristaps Poristinky,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks
Luka and KP combined 4-19 from 3pt range. Still win. Okay. THJ carrying the mavs then,qeijgk,Toronto Raptors,Dallas Mavericks

"Trying not to overreact *too* much to performance against bad/injured teams, but extremely encouraging signs that this defense will be at least average, if not outright good. Probably still a little soft inside, but Caruso/Lonzo are absolute dogs on the perimeter, and I like the energy/activity from a lot of the bench guys as well.

“They will be a disaster on D because of Lavine/Derozan” was a lazy narrative imo. We were about average last year and upgraded our defensive talent overall",qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
"Zach LaVine makes his 555th 3-pointer and ties Michael Jordan for #4 career 3-point FGs in Bulls history. Just over 100 to go to tie Scottie Pippen (664) for the 3rd spot. It might take him the rest of the season to take the #1 career spot, held by Kirk Hinrich (1049). 

Breaking records even on his down nights.",qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
"Vucevic with 18 rebounds and 15 points, nice double-double. Also three assists, two steals, and three blocks.",qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls

"I think the plan going forward for Chicago is to have Lavine/DeMar be 1A and 1B , it’s clear the ball is going to be in their hands a lot

Barnes has been fantastic for us , next game he’s probably going to matchup with DeMar

Looks like my prediction of 50 wins for the Bulls is looking good.,qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
"The Bulls are just iconic man, feels literally wrong when they aren’t good",qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
"Something people have missed in their analysis of the Bulls is that this is the first time in a decade where Demar's not expected to get the most points for his team in every single game. It's the first time he's playing with someone who's actually a better scorer than him since Bosh left Toronto.

That in itself frees up so much space for him to operate - and keeps him fresher throughout the game. The weight of not being the 'guy' externally must also be quite freeing (I'd imagine, but who knows).

This is obviously Zach's team in terms of marketing and leadership + long-term potential and he's definitely the more well-rounded player anyway, but think by mid-season, the actual game-plan will clearly treat them as 1A/1B, with Vuc and Zo playing crucial roles as well. That's pretty much the case right now, but it's more experimental at the moment, seeing how everything fits.

I'm very excited to see how this goes - if things go just slightly better than expected, the ceiling for this team is quite a lot higher than most predictions - very much an Atlanta/Suns type situation last year.

Bring on Toronto - that's always a game that gets Demar motivated, hopefully a 30 point night coming.",qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls

LeBallZach strikes again,qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
"Our guard rotation is horrid without Cade currently. Defense looked solid for the most part but our offense was horrid tonight, extremely stagnant

Shouts out Saddiq though, he quietly had 20 and 16 somehow",qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
Hayes sucks and KOC is a moron,qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
Top 1 most likable team rightnow:Chicago Bulls,qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
Let's go Bulls!!!!,qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
The Lonzo/Lavine/Caruso/Javonte/Pat lineup is going to be demonic va teams who don’t have a full blown post up threat. And having Demar (offense) and Caruso/Green (defense/overall aggression) as mentors should push Pat even further towards the trajectory of being a star.,qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
"Feel like at least so far there is a slight overreaction with these Bulls wins so far.

They have played the Cavs once and the Pistons twice. These are arguably the 13th and 14th best teams in the East. Not particularly surprised that they won all three of them. 

I really am just waiting to see how the Bulls do against good/great competition and how they stack up. Early results are good, but I'm not sold until they can consistently take down teams like Milwaukee, Miami, Golden State, Utah, etc.",qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
82-0 Bulls incoming?,qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
"I think Bulls could be the top 4 of east this season along with Bucks, Sixers, and Hawks. Nets are looking for the 5th so they could get the away game advantage",qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
Damn bulls bench is buns.,qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
"Bulls are a must watch league pass team so far. They are just fun. If they stay healthy, I see them as a lite version of what we expected the nets to be. Bad defense, great offense, and it won’t be easy to outscore them",qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
Hey mods can we get a spoiler tag or something? Brit here usually watch games the day after on league pass as 3am is too much dedication for me!,qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls
"The Pistons shot 5-28 for 3. The defence looks pretty good, just make a few more threes and it's a ball game. Bulls perimeter defence is also good, but Pistons missed some easy shots too. All this without the 1st pick, I'm happy unlike a lot of Pistons fans.",qeiz0f,Detroit Pistons,Chicago Bulls

"Herb, JV and BI deserve better",qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"Some thoughts:

D'lo was horrific for 90% of the game but he showed big time in the 4th quarter (like he usually does tbf).

Ant was bad tonight. He argued with refs constantly over no calls and wasn't thinking through what he should do on offence.

KAT was a God on offence but his beef with JV surfaces again and he fouled out. He needs to learn to keep that shit under wraps or for the Wolves to have a James Johnson type of guy to go out and beat the shit of Jonas so KAT doesn't rack up fouls.

Also the refs were fucking dogshit. 

Last year this is a game the Wolves would have lost 100% though.",qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"That DLo shot was the kinda shot my little cousin makes when he's angry when we bully him on the court, then the shot goes in and the game is done, then the made shot is the only thing he talks about for the next 3 days. Love you, DLo.",qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans

Was much closer than it looks.

Shouldn’t have been",qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans

If you don’t like 30 turnovers and only losing by 7 then you don’t like Pelicans basketball.,qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
So happy we could pull that out. Defense is legit. Also Graham is booty isn't he.,qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"This would be a blow out if Dlo was hitting his shots early on and not committing silly turnovers. 

He hit his shot late game to win it, but we shouldn't even be in that position in the first place",qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
bruh the offense is lookin a little anemic,qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"TWolves on path to that 82-0 season, it's literally math",qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
Pray for Ingram and Jonas,qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
never a doubt.,qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"Herb Jones and TM3 both played with incredible effort tonight. Especially Herb, he was a steal in the second round, the second chance opportunities he created were crucial to our comeback in the second half. I was pleased with the overall effort from the team tonight but the sloppy play and our overall lack of cohesion on offense really killed us. I feel like once Zion comes back the offense will open up more as players that aren't suited to create shots will be asked to play off of him more, but the turnovers NEED to improve if we wanna win some games this year.",qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
MINNESOTA TIMBERWWO~~L~~VES,qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"Man if embiid or jokic played the way kat played tonight they'd still be in the game. It's just the way officials call him, and it's unacceptable",qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"I'm very sad, but Herb Jones was a mf-ing beast in that third quarter. jeeeez.",qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
Man the Pels are struggling. Once we get things firing on all cylinders we are gonna be good.,qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
I'm happy for the Wolves. After being meme'd for years they deserve this.,qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans

Holy fucking shit do we suck something tremendous right now. I really just hope this is the learning curve and not just the probable reality that we fucking suck,qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans

"30 Turnovers by the Pelicans, ice-cold shooting from deep, no Zion. And the Wolves at home by 9. The Wolves were gifted several baskets too. The 1 at the end of the 3rd in particular, but they also got at least 3 lucky bounces on triples.",qej4o9,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans

Even though we didnt get the win im still proud of us giving the nuggets and bucks a challenge and a bit of a scare. We may not have any big names but we give it our all. Well done bucks.,qejjyw,Milwaukee Bucks,San Antonio Spurs
"
I love Jordan Nwora. I was already super high on him coming in and he’s exceeded my expectations so far this year. Hustling his ass off, playing just about respectable defence, moving the ball around, the whole lot. Was particularly impressed toward the end of the 2nd quarter when he had a pretty good look from three but played the touch pass to Hill in the corner for an even better look. That’s exactly the kind of thing we need from our role players and he is absolutely nailing it.

We haven’t had anything resembling a microwave scorer since Bud came in but he’s the guy, no doubt he’s going to be a very important player for us sooner rather than later.

Poeltl had a really good game too even if his box score numbers don’t really pop (aside from the blocks). I’ve barely watched him since he went to SA but he did a pretty good job on Giannis defensively and took advantage of our lack of bigs on the other end when Giannis was on the bench as well.",qejjyw,Milwaukee Bucks,San Antonio Spurs
Pat Connaughton has really gone from “why did you give him that contract” to one of the biggest underpays in the league,qejjyw,Milwaukee Bucks,San Antonio Spurs

"I love my team! We lost two games but I felt good about them! We battled till the very end against two important teams with awful mismatches for us!

"We’re scrappy as hell, yet somehow completely adverse to willingly taking 3s by anyone not named McBuckets (which with a name like that, makes sense).

Rotations and help that you guys didn’t even try to bring last year are coming.

You guys also replaced Melo/Kanter with Nance/Zeller. Two huge negatives on D to two positives on D.

Nance also gives you guys a serviceable small ball 5 when your traditional bigs are getting toasted.

You guys replaced 48 minutes of garbage defenders with 48 minutes of plus defenders a night.",qekn8k,Portland Trail Blazers,Phoenix Suns

We got a bit too iso happy in the third and let the grizzlies build the lead. 

Also I know lue wants to keep Morris in so he can get hot but Batum is just so much better in so many different facets of the game. You can just see it this game alone.",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies

GG Memphis. Ja is a beast",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Grizzlies normally can rely on their bench but won today with just 13 bench points. These starters play really well together, but when Dillon comes back and the bench gets a boost from either Bane or DMelt, we should be an incredibly well rounded team.

So excited for this season",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Just not enough support around PG overall and we missed some crucial shots.

Adams looks really good for the Grizz, it kinda seems like a great system for him to chip in and do what he does well.",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Big difference here was we hit our open threes and the clippers really didn't. Morris hits open shots we might have lost. Jaren misses some late threes we might have lost. But neither of those happened so it worked out

Also Adams looking great so far. Really does all the little things JV did but without the need for nearly as many touches. Only posted up when the clippers went small. His screens are top tier, rolls really hard, rebounding is solid. Works nicely since we get all the things we need in a C but can give more shots to our guards, who balled out tonight.

Also shout-out Bane that last shot he hit was unreal. 

Last note - PG13 is a monster. Every time he shot a 3 I thought it was going in.",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Obviously the story of the game was Ja and Jaren, but wanna highlight Adams and Melton. Adams is perfect for this team. Good enough on defense, gets lots of rebounds, has decent touch with passes and clears the lane for an easy layup for Ja about 2-3 times a game already

And Melton is so underrated and his shot is legit now. He's only 23, was already great on defense and getting better every year on offense and on a very favorable contract for the next 3 seasons.

"Great game Grizz!! Jaren with a clutch 3, 21 & 7 rebs and solid D. Ja with 28 & 8 asts and strong decision making and leadership. Bane and Melton hitting big shots all game.

"Damn, protagonist P",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies

Paul George averaged 13 points against us last year……,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies

"PG MVP is definitely on the cards. He's come out firing to start the season.

Good game, Grizzlies. Y'all played well.",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
PG single handedly kept them in the game.,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
That dagger by JJJ sheeeeeesh. Grizzlies still one of the most fun teams in the league to watch for the third season in a row,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Okay, who the fuck is bane",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
"I don't think Ja was even trying that hard tonight.

Just wait till we get out of the party zone.",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
Jesus PG is on some shit,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
This team is mad good. Adams is fitting into the team very nicely. Also PG is a monster. Kept the Clips in this throughout the game.,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
Always a pleasure to watch Ja Morant play.,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
I started watching with 2 minutes left in the 4th... did not regret it,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
Lakers right now: “Meep.”,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
That Bane shot though.,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
So many big plays by young players down the stretch. You love to see it. Bane is gonna be a monster,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies

Pg can’t win with these cats,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
Morris sold,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
Damn the Grizz almost had five guys at 20 points. That’s a solid team.,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies

"Just like that, neither LA team has won a game since June",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
the whole game was grizzlies getting a lead and clippers clawing it back. goooood fucking game.,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies

Battle of LA gonna be in the play-in tourney this year,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
"This was my first time watching Ja play. Very very interesting to observe, he seems unlike any other ""star"" player I've seen as someone who's only been into the NBA for 4 years. 

I think it's because he looks SO SMALL to me compared to everyone else on the court.

I wonder if he needs to bulk up a little bit if he wants to elevate his game to true super star levels

Super fun team to watch! Look forward to matching up with them later in the season, though I feel like it's gonna be a stressful game hah",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Clippers and Lakers both losing, you love to see it.",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
Thunder gonna have two top 5 picks at this rate 😂,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
I'm surprised they kept putting the ball in Bledsoe's hands towards the end instead of Reggie Jackson?,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
Will the Lakers or Clippers win their first game first?,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
"0-2 Clippers, all according to keikaku",qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
Extremely balanced attack from the grizzlies,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
Only mildly upset that we didn’t pick Bane in the draft. /s,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies
Man when did Bledsoe get sent to the clippers? I don’t remember that happening at all.,qelbmx,Los Angeles Clippers,Memphis Grizzlies

"Lamelo playing ZERO MINUTES in the 4th quarter despite a great game is a testament to how well Ish Smith and Cody Martin played tonight.

"I really hope Nets fans never forget when Cody Martin hit an iso stepback 3 on KD to ice the game. Or when he drew two consecutive charges to get Harden out of the game.

KD is just unreal from mid range.,qf2jvt,Brooklyn Nets,Charlotte Hornets
"i got downvoted for telling people they need to remember how even last year the nets had to play their big 3 like 40 minutes a game to guarantee some of the wins  


they absolutely can bury you especially if the entire team is rolling but if they only have two of the three and one of them has an off night, they're incredibly beatable  


if the hornets can beat them by 10 shooting 30% from 3 when durant goes off shooting great then yeah they're very much beatable with just 2 of the big 3, durant is scary but honestly the bucks did not play very consistent or well that series last year",qf2jvt,Brooklyn Nets,Charlotte Hornets

Good to see C's get it together after a shaky start. Looking forward to Nesmith's nerves settling. Props to Grant Williams for keeping us on track.,qf685a,Houston Rockets,Boston Celtics

If this team was serious about competing this season, I would be stressing the need for a more passing PG (and I'll admit that I'm not as high on KPJ compared to other Rockets fans) and better wing defense as Tatum just did whatever he wanted. Still, it was a good loss.",qf685a,Houston Rockets,Boston Celtics
"Rockets y'all got a real good one, Jalen Green is a baller. Sengun looked good too",qf685a,Houston Rockets,Boston Celtics

Still, very disappointing performance from us and can't help but feel we kind of gave this away. Have no idea why we were so committed to dying by the 3 when we should have been focusing on exploiting Orlando's relative inexperience and picking up and-ones off the drive (like we started to do in the last minute).",qf67oy,Orlando Magic,New York Knicks

This was a Magic team beating a team that needs to win soon and the Magic that is rebuilding won that through out hustling and just out fighting for the win. That is a winning mentality. They did great, Cole Suggs, RJ are the type of players who fight till the end and were great pickups to lead this developing team.

"Terrence Ross.......................**FUCK YOU**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the game right after we hit a team record of 24 3PTM turns out to be the one where the jumpshot betrays us completely. It already seemed over though when D Rose missed a FT after the foul in the final minute (being an 88.3% FT shooter), in this day and age it's incredibly difficult to win back to back games, even against teams that aren't expected to be in the playoffs or that you beat soundly

Next week will be very brutal for us against the 76ers on Tuesday and the Bulls on Thursday. Hopefully this bitter loss doesn't trickle down on the upcoming games.",qf67oy,Orlando Magic,New York Knicks

"For most of the game Philly announsers were very good, I was enjoiyng them, but the commentary on Emdiid's foul on Giddey was surprising to me. ""Couldn't care less about Giddey, as long as Joel is ok"", fuck you dude.

Good game from our boys btw, much better then first two",qf5uhk,Oklahoma City Thunder,Philadelphia 76ers
Curry looking like Curry tonight.,qf5uhk,Oklahoma City Thunder,Philadelphia 76ers
"good game by jojo, but why try to block that, jesus",qf5uhk,Oklahoma City Thunder,Philadelphia 76ers
"That was an EXTREMELY fun game, I don't even care that we lost.

Shai had a rough first 2 games, but dominated tonight. He was much more aggressive and getting to the rim at will. He was SCORCHING Thybulle, a top defender in the league. Really nice to see him play well.

Giddey was just incredible man. He's so so good at only 19. Amazing passer with a DEADLY floater. Good that he finally had a bigger role today.

Dort in the 4th quarter was a man possessed. Incredible defense and energy plays.

I really liked our offense more today. More ball movement.

Super super fun game! Give me more of this!",qf5uhk,Oklahoma City Thunder,Philadelphia 76ers
"How the fuck did Timothee Chalamet drop Dune and proceed to drop 19/8/6 in great efficiency. Happy to see Jo dap him up after that block attempt, the players were cool about it, somehow neckbeards here are losing their shit.",qf5uhk,Oklahoma City Thunder,Philadelphia 76ers

The Warriors' record in games where Draymond scores 10+ is absolutely ridiculous.,qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"Tristan Thompson will never outrebound Steph again in their matchups lol. 

Holmes is still underrated for what he can bring. D.Mitch better  than what I thought.",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"The Kings being behind in the fourth quarter always leads to very frustrating basketball as they seem to rush everything without thinking at that point, leading to both bad offense and bad defense.

GP2 is a pest on defense. Great pickup!,qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings

Davion first step is crazy,qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
GSW now the first seed in the West-- feels like old times,qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"4Q Poole/GP2/Wiggins/OPJ/JTA is now my new favourite Warriors lineup lol. Little sloppy but those guys are hustle personified.

JTA is looking more and more like mini-Dray by each game. Dude didnt have a great offensive game but was directing traffic all throughout the start of 4th and getting the hustle plays.",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"Random thoughts:

Steph was OFF tonight and the Warriors still grinded out a win, good sign for the Warriors, scary sign for the rest of the West

Warriors kind sleptwalked through this game, Kings played with significantly higher intensity, said effort would lead to a win most nights

Poole had a nice bounceback game after a rough start to the season

OPJ is such a luxury for the warriors to have, and the MVP of this game imio, dude can play anywhere from the 3-5, and his defense is underrated, if hes healthy warriors will be very tough to beat

Davion needs to be in the Kings closing lineup, his defense is too valuable to sit on the bench

Rishaun Holmes is mad underrated, dude is such a solid C, Kings are lucky to have him

WTF happened to Hali?  dude looks lost out there rn

Been said before, but fire Walton ffs, Kings with a real head coach would be a serious play in contender, with upside, as it stands they lack a real offensive system outside of shoot 3's, PnR, and Fox Iso's, same applies to defense

Buddy Hield has no conscience, sometimes thats good, sometimes thats bad, tonight it was bad

I wanna see the Kings try some super small ball, Fox-Haliburton/Hield-Mitchell-Harkless-HB, just try and gas teams out running up and down",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
Congrats to the 69th best assist man.,qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"God damn. This Warriors with no Curry team is looking legit. The ball movement, shooting, and ability to score off the dribble by the 2nd unit really showed out there in the 4th and broke out the close game. And fuck me was Steph’s defense great in this game.

Warriors may have a legit shot at being a top 3 Western team.",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"for the last 2-3 years, we've done an amazing job of falling apart in the last few minutes against the Warriors

okay, that's every team, but especially the Warriors",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings

It was nice to see Harrison Barnes play like it was game 7 of the finals.,qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"WWWarriors

This Warriors team is deep. Poole and Bjelica are playmakers. They can create their own shots, and will find open players for good shot opportunities. And then guys like JTA and Damion Lee and Porter are not afraid to take shots as the game presents it to them. Wouldn't surprise me if their finish as a 3 seed or better.",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings

"the warriors are back. This team is deep af and currys game is ageless. Only the jazz suns and maybe the nuggets going to give them trouble.

Interesting how much of a back seat Bjelica took tonight once Kerr figured out the problem was staying in front of Fox/Mitchell/Barnes.  Nice to see Barnes doing well, by the by.  I swear I thought Poole had a terrible game from all the hero shots he threw away, but I guess he was making them while I wasn't looking.",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
Kings need a leader bad. Fox need to step up,qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"The Kings really might be a playoff team this year. Their three headed guard thing reminds me of those Dragic/Bledsoe/IT Suns. And with good talented frontcourt guys like Holmes and Barnes, they're running legitimately talented lineups.",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"Warriors are closing out games much much better now, it's been something we've struggled with quite a bit last year.",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"We say this every year but…. The kings have some great young talent. Fox, Haliburton, and Mitchell all seem to be on the right track. 

Holmes is a decent big (those push shots are automatic). HB overall is pretty solid. Hield is an elite shooter but isn’t very good at anything else. 

They seem close to being a playoff team, just need some more depth and some veteran players to bring it all together.",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings

Are we spooky,qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
This is the problem I've had with Barnes his entire career. He's never assertive whether he's on fire or not. They had Buddy just launching up garbage 3 after 3 in the 4th. I think hb touched the ball once in the 4th quarter.  At some point you gotta be like give me the fucking ball.,qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"These kings are young and fun and it makes me happy.

I will be watching and rooting all year.",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings
"Yet again, for the umpteenth year in a row, it's not the losses, it's how we lose.

A team made out of cardboard that can't finish a game strong ever.  We have a coach who doesn't understand player strengths and weaknesses.  Insisting on Buddy being a ball handler... Jesus man. 

Speaking of Buddy, he's not an NBA player.  Period.  He can shoot the lights out when no one guards him.  He should be wearing a jump suit on the sideline in his new role as shooting coach.  He can't play basketball, he can only shoot basketballs.

And wtf are we even doing with Bagley?? DNP-CD game 1, plays some minutes game 2, DNP-CD game 3... I get that he's trash but what are we even doing?  But at least he can't turn the ball over in crunch time when he's on the bench... Unlike buddy.

Took 3 games for us to say ""same ol kings"".  16 years out of the playoffs in a league where half the teams make the playoffs.  Can we get a banner in the rafters for that?",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings

Curry is still in his prime and they waste time with players who won't see the court in a play off game. These guys deserved better and as soon as Curry (with Draymond and Klay)  hangs it up, GSW will be right there with the worst teams in the nba.",qf824r,Golden State Warriors,Sacramento Kings

Lebron is now 7 steals away from getting to the #12 all time steals spot. Russ is 7 TO away from the 8th spot then 14 more till 7th.

Its Carmelo saving Lakers ??? Wtf,qf8mcj,Los Angeles Lakers,Memphis Grizzlies
That out of bounds Davis steal/flop over Adams that got overturned was nuts. Adams didn't touch him and I watched it 5 times and can't figure out how he fell. A man committed to his flop craft. No wonder he gets hurt so much. I mean he already had the steal. I guess maybe he just fell! You know you have real ref problems in the nba when a real fall meta flop results in foul call and confuses the hell outa everybody so bad it needs to be challenged and reviewed to make sure it wasn't a fake flop foul and just a normal fall.

Ja Morant with a 3 point shot is a top 5 pg in the game

WB is such a comically bad fit for the Lakers rn, if it werent for old man Melo turning back the clock theyd be 0-3

Glad to see Reaves crack the rotation, he deserves the minutes, and fits in well with Bron/AD, hope he gets an expanded role going forward

Melo is a certified shooter. 

Seems like Bazemore was being scored on at will by all the Grizz. That last foul on Ja was just stupid. DJ is also a defensive liability.

What a move by FVV at the end...,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"GG. The Bulls defense was way nastier than I was expecting. DeBallZach work great together though.

I feel like they're one more big man and some chemistry development away from making serious noise.

Also happy to see the Raps not just give up.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Bulls are a well built team man, very good...Bulls being top of the east again makes me feel nostalgic

GG!",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls

Gg Toronto.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls

Hot damn we tried throwing this game,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"If Freddy hits that, woulda broke the subreddit",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Man the Raptors are still a good ass team. All the talk of their demise was way exaggerated. OG looked like he’s taken a leap, Scottie is super impressive and that defense is still phenomenal. They had us completely disoriented and frazzled with their full court press. Thank goodness for Demar haha. We obviously need to learn how to close out close games and that’s why the Demar signing was so big for us. A bunch of good players who haven’t built up that experience yet because of the teams they’ve been on so there’s Demar to settle the ship. Great game!",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"One day we will win a game on our home floor this season.

GG Bulls",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"That 4th wasn’t good for my heart…

DeMar really been a raptor killer since we traded him.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Despite our best efforts to blow it, we pulled it out baby",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Real good fucking test of closing out games. Raptors made it tough and that's what this team needs. We need to be kept on our toes. 

Also is that another game of Zach fling scoreless in the first quarter? Demar is a God send for this squad able to hold it down while Lavine's shots aren't falling. 

Also looks like they'll be practicing in bounds and playing against traps LMFAO",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Demar haters crying and throwing up rn,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Tough loss, but damn that was a fun game to watch. Bulls look great this season, and I'm excited to see how they do!",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
DEBALLZACK STILL UNDEFEATED,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
We gonna be so good when siakam comes back,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls

#ALL I KNOW IS PAIN,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
That was an incredible fourth quarter. Shame we lost but I’m very impressed with the performance.,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Fred with a career high 17 ast and 8 to haha,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Freddy balled tf out at the end there,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls

"Fuck me, am I becoming a Bulls fan?",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"That 4th quarter was ugly, but a win is a win.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
I really do enjoy playing the raptors. We have such a good friendly rivalry. Hopefully it goes back to being super competitive again!,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Dam that was a nice game. Gg bulls kept it real interesting till the end,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"FVV willed them back in this game. He looked pissed walking back to the dressing room with both hands in a fist.

Demar is so fucken smooth

Competitive games are great but this team needs wins before it starts feeling like Tampa",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
I could do with not having to face OG and Scottie Barnes much in the season. Barnes is so fucking good.,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"The way Fred crossed Vuc and made that mfer woozy... if that 3 went in I'd have gone nuts..

GGs",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Woah.. Canada, you have your own separate Sportscenter?",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Really fuck with this roster despite the last couple losses. These guys play hard and that's all i can ask for as a fan.,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Tough loss there, but that was a really good game. DeMar made some.killer shots in the 4th",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"such a good game, freddie did everything right to get an open shot at the end. Such a shame he couldn’t cap off a great comeback and a great individual night with a win.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls

What a fuckin game man my god,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
A win is a win but damn that last quarter was embarrassing,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
i know that Lonzo turnover had Bulls fans sweating,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
I take back everything I ever said about Fred not being able to run an offense. 17 assists is nutty,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Lucky to squeak that one out..gg raptors,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
this game was fucking ugly,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Didn’t throw the game💅,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Bulls are 4 & oh,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Despite Zo having quite a few brain off moments at the end there, he had a great game on both sides of the court.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"God damn what a great game. Caruso had some clutch defensive plays in the 4th. And of course DeMar hits a mid range EVERY time we seem to gain some momentum. 

I really want to see FVV run the PnR with Scottie Barnes, and have him make the decision to either drive or pass from the high post like Draymond Green. I feel like he's standing around too much on the offensive end, and this should be a good way to make use of his playmaking abilities.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Bull's been going under the radar but imo this is the true super team,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Toronto and Nick Nurse get huge props for their defense in the second half. They turned it up and really pushed the bulls out of their comfort zone and were able to create a lot of momentum.,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
DeBallZach can't be beat,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Scottie Barnes is the real deal, going to be a nightmare in a couple years",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"The Raptors will find a way to the play-in at minimum, too well coached & too many above average/good players. Loved seeing the Toronto crowd back in their house, it was very noticeable. Let’s see how LaVine & crew handle this tough stretch coming up",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Guys, I think the Bulls ain't playing this year holy shit they're seriously good.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Just like DeRozan when I shoot it goes in,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Lonzo and Vuc tried their best to choke that away,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Just because the Bulls won, it was still a dumb decision not to foul in the last posession, FVV had an extremely clean look",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Vuc absolutely falling apart at the end for the Bulls,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Bulls kept trying to hand the game to the Raptors lmao what was that ending,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Why didn’t vuc foul?,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Nobody looks happy after this win. Good. Stay hungry!,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"A win’s a win. But if this is the way we execute down the stretch, i’m fucking worried for the upcoming 13 games..",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Ngl I almost had a heart attack that last minute,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Everything except the 4th qtr looked good today. Still happy we got the W tho,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Won the Bulls -2 spread, this game had me dying.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
I think we take this with Siakam but GG Bulls. Demar was clutch down the stretch.,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Don’t let the score fool you it was much closer than that,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Well I think this game really showed Bulls need a shot blocker. Bulls look like they have a good defense, but when things start falling apart they just don’t have a fallback option.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Can’t wait to watch 2 undefeated teams battle it out on November 12th for my very first live NBA game (@Warriors),qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Now I know how it feels to be on the other side of a DeMar takeover

The dude was unstoppable in the 4th , scoring on both Barnes and OG",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Heartbreaking loss, but it was a fun game.

GG Bulls",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
I love this damn team! So fun to watch,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
You just lost to the 82nd best player- oh wait...,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Bulls dare I say…. Are spooky?,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
ADMIT THE BULLS ARE GOOD RN OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Demar and Lavine close to that superstar stat range of 25/5/ plus.,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Though this game was pretty rough, this is the most fun I’ve had watching a bulls team in half a decade",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"The Bulls starting 5 is LOADED



Lonzo finally being what he's supposed to be (kind of) changes that entire team.   Just loaded 

>

And i still don't understand why Lakers let go of CARUSO.   He was far more useful and valuable next to LeBron and AD, compared to Westbrook.  And Caruso was doing damage off the ball, on both ends of the floor.  

Westbrook at this point is just a glorified contract that kills your team on the floor and on the books.  He's almost useless without the ball, and if you have LeBron on your team, you wouldn't want anyone else to have the ball, regardless

>

Just a horrendous fit.  They could still make it work, because LeBron is LeBron. He has always done more with less, and maybe he can even elevate Westbrook to a different level.  But it's still a horrible fit

 With LeBron and AD, all you need more is SHOOTING and defensive depth.  Westbrook literally gives none of that",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Bulls didn't react well to some tough 2nd half defense. Playing not to lose. They will clean it up. Zach also needs to work on taking advantage of the double and triple teams everyone is laying on him. He is awesome but not that awesome. Jordan had to learn the same thing. I think Demar will guide him. This is the way.,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
No one is safe from the Bulls,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Greatest start since the 96-97 season!,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
This bulls team is fun to watch,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"As a Lakers fan, it's really bittersweet watching these Bulls. Especially Lonzo. I'm stoked he's blossomed into such a solid player. Seeing him and Caruso together brings a tear to my eye. Seeing the Bulls having so much fun is hard to watch while AD and Dwight are having a dick measuring contest on the Lakers bench.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Damn, another nice game from Scottie Barnes, has me worried about Cade lol dudes gonna be under a lot of pressure to perform from game one",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"I’m kinda loving this bulls team, they’re low key scary, like they don’t seem so, but then the horror builds and builds and they’re terrifying.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
DeMar DeRozan came up clutch when bulls needed him most. He silenced the raptors crowd 3 times in the last 4 minutes.,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"Gotta give a lot of credit to the Raps, they never gave up even when down big. They played really well down the stretch forcing turnovers, DeMar just bailed us out.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"It truly sucks that we made all those little mistakes and still barely lost. Feel like we couldve easily won this one with simply a higher percentage of easy layups made

With that being said those kinks will work themselves out and I think this was a pretty promising loss. The bulls are a damn good team and we don't even have Siakam yet",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"So, I love the Bulls and I’m not afraid to say it!",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Y'all look different,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls

"Entertaining game. Great late fake comeback lol. Had way too many turnovers, but the Raps stuck in there and had a chance to get it to OT. Demar was clutch down the stretch for the Bulls and I like what I saw from FVV, OG and Gary Trent Jr.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
Fucking hell what a game,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
That ending was an ending all right,qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls

"Derozan was beautiful late game. Lavine moved passed MJ for 3 pointers. Lonzo was great on defense and from 3. We almost lost because of chemistry-related/absent minded turnovers. 

OG and Scottie looked amazing, and that raptors defense late was suffocating as all hell.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls
"I’m so happy to see Lonzo playing well on a team that appreciates his skills and plays to his strengths. 

As a Nets fan, I saw that the same management in LA that dumped D’Lo for him was putting too much pressure on him to succeed. And New Orleans? Forget it. What a mess. 

I never really bought into Lonzo being a bust. Glad to see him doing well.",qfw07l,Toronto Raptors,Chicago Bulls

Turns out it’s a bad idea to have point guards guard Jimmy Butler.,qfvxh2,Miami Heat,Orlando Magic
"As a Michigan fan, Franz has completely been outplaying my expectations so far. His 3 point shot has been inconsistent as I expected, but his defense, passing, and IQ have been great. He makes great cuts the rim, always knows where to be on both ends of floor, and knows when to make the extra pass.

* Jimmy was phenomenal. Brilliant, efficient 36pt performance.
* Herro came back down to earth tonight scoring wise, but he passed very well
* FT% was a **perfect** 100% tonight. 3-ball was off and it didn't even matter. You love to see it.

Also, I know everyone is super into the new reffing right now, which is cool, but if refs ignore actual fouls in the paint (which was happening all game for both teams) it's gonna lead to a ton of jump shots, which can be kinda boring to watch, especially in a game like today where both teams shot like crap.",qfw2jc,Brooklyn Nets,Washington Wizards

Brandon Ingram is an assassin,qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"That was a tough game to watch.

The good news is that our defense still looks solid as long as we have our best players our there.  KAT in particular looked much improved on defense.  Also credit for him for regaining his calm after that nightmare first quarter.

The bad news is our offense is looking funky.  We're too reliant on three's dropping instead of running plays to get easy points especially when KAT isn't out there.  How funny would it be that it turns out we're a better defensive team than offensive team?",qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
BI IS HIM!!!,qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans

# BRANDON INGRAM IS SPECIAL 🗣🗣🗣,qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"At some point Finch needs to do what is obvious here. I'm sure ANT was tired from putting the team on his back in the 3rd but the end game needs to run through him not DLo. DLo is the 3rd banana here and he needs to accept that.

Credit to Val for his game and Ingram and Graham for hitting big shots to stem the tide and keep us at bay.",qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans

The motherfucking Herb Machine came in again with that sweet +1.,qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans

Also, BI the closer. Magnificent performance from him down the stretch.",qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"Meh, Pels deserved this one.
Insanely chippy game.
I don’t have any doubt that the offense will be good, but it’s looked insanely bad. I know they focused almost entirely on defense during training camp, so I’ll give it some time",qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"Brandon Ingram better be an all star this season. Those 4 straight shots to seal the game were just insane

Edwards went NUCLEAR in the 3rd so glad he didn’t do that the entire game.

"Shot like crap.

Got outrebounded by 19.

Only lost by 9.

How???",qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"Few thoughts here:

- Really disappointing that Finch didn't run more plays through Edwards in the 4th. D'Lo got the rock most of the 4th and made only 1 3 and bricked like 4. Edwards had a hot 3rd. He didn't start to get the ball until the game was nearly out of reach with like 3-4 minutes to go. No idea why Russell got so much there.

- Jonas was a monster on offense. No answer for him but KAT had some good defense at times on him. There's a reason why Jonas went 7-18. But he was the player of the game imo. Monster on boards, drew fouls like crazy, took advantage of mismatches.

- Ingram had his way. He ended the game by himself with those iso mid rangers. He made a really tough one over McDaniels but he had some really easy ones whenever McDaniels was not guarding him. 

- Beverley baby. He was amazing. I felt that he should have closed the game instead. He was knocking down 3s, playing elite defense, and the team was feeding off his energy. Wolves fans in the arena were loving him. If anything he should have closed over Beasley. Now that one makes more sense. 

- I'm liking Wolves defense but they still have work to do when Bev is on the bench and opponents create switches that take McDaniels off his assignment because it leads to Wolves bleeding points. We saw it whenever Ingram wasn't guarded by McDaniels although Ingran still got points on him. They weren't easy, but I'd rather get beat by making it tough on Ingram over him getting easy points on Russell/Edwards/Beasley. 

- Ultimately what really killed Wolves was being cold from 3. It let Pels stack the paint. Essentially taking away easy layups/dunks that we saw Edwards get all 3rd quarter. If Russell, Beasley, and co were able to knock down from 3 then this game would have been so much different. Pels would then have to guard the perimeter and Edwards would have feasted at the rim. Instead they just placed 3-4 bodies in there and let Wolves brick 3s all 4th quarter.",qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans
"I ll say it before the offseason, unfortunately, DLO aint it. I think a jordan Carkson role is best for him",qfwigd,Minnesota Timberwolves,New Orleans Pelicans

And honestly this is L is on Finch and the prior game almost went the same way but D'lo bailed us out. I have no idea what happened to the man over the summer but he has tried to make the TWolves into a defence first team at the expense of the only thing which was good about us and that was our offence.

"Random Thoughts

Thunder starters are solid, Shai-Dort-Giddey-Bazeley-random C is solid starting 5, certainly better than their record indicates

Really like the Thunder’s offensive sets, should run more of them, creates lots of good looks for the players, they don’t always knock them down but good looks nonetheless

Shai gotta work on fouling less, needs to realize he’s the most important player on the court for OKC, let some buckets go so you can play more aggressive in crunch time, seriously Shai is so damn good.  

Giddey’s has off the charts BBIQ and passing ability for his age, if he ever develops a consistent off the dribble jumpshot, league fucked

OKC did a really good job of slowing the game down, making it more half court to half court, more up-tempo favors the Warriors, as seen by the end of the 3rd quarter

OKC has a ton of guys who can handle the ball, makes them a pain to defend if you have a shot-blocking C

Bazeley needs to realize he’s a role player and not a star, takes too many bad shots, wastes too many posessions

Dort’s defense is porn, like god he’s so fucking good at defense its ridiculous, man should be 1st team this year if he’s healthy,  rest of OKC’s defense though is not good, but that’s too be expected of a young team

OKC just kinda ran out of gas always through the 3rd Q, played 2.5 quarters of great basketball, but couldn’t keep executing at such a high level for the remaining 1.5 Q’s.  

Warriors sleepwalking through another game against weaker competition, a concerning trend early in the season

I don’t like JP in the starting lineup, makes it too hard for him and Steph to get into rhythm since they both want the ball in their hands (too many cooks in the kitchen scenario), would rather DLee start over him and move JP back into the 6th man role

I also don’t think Looney should start every game, especially against the thunder going super small I’d rather see OPJ, JTA or Dray start at the 5

Warriors gang rebounding is impressive, but it does hurt their ability to get out on the break,

Stop overcommitting on three point shooters, especially against a team that isnt great at hitting them, gave away wayyyyyyy too many free buckets to OKC cuz of over rotations by Warriors defenders

DLee is the warriors MVP tonight, consistent shooting, shockingly good D, great offball movement, etc, best player not named Steph tonight for the Warriors

Wiggins came alive in the 2nd half, buoyed the Warriors offense for the first 2/3rds of the 3rd Q

Took the Warriors way too long to realize they can attack the paint with impunity against this small OKC team

Loved the 3rd quarter closing lineup, Steph-lee-JTA-Dray-OPJ is a nasty lineup (sidetone good things happen when JTA’s in), really shut down the Thunders drive game

Kerr’s adjustments won them this game, experimented around until he found the right lineup/lineups, and made lots of smart tinkers in the 4th Q (like taking Poole out so quickly after subbing Steph back in), really damn good coach. Also this warriors team is stupid deep lol.",qgmbgn,Golden State Warriors,Oklahoma City Thunder

"Great win, we didn’t quit, and kept the intensity.

**Positives**: Russell Westbrook (33,10,8) and Anthony Davis (35 and 17) had big games. R. Westbrook especially made a couple of important baskets down the stretch. Malik Monk was solid also. We didn’t give up mentally overall down the stretch.

**Negatives**: We have clear defensive issues. We were making Jakob Peotl look like the second coming of George Mikan out there, it was ridiculous. We gotta defend the pick and roll a bit better. Also, we need to do a better job rebounding. We need to go back to the fundamental point of boxing out. We have been giving up too many offensive rebounds, which lead to second chance points (16 to 9 for SAS today), and with the size we have, we have no excuses for this to happen. Finally, we struggled from 3 (26%). LeBron has been our best shooter from 3, and his absence was felt in this area today.",qgn48q,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers

Lonnie Walker had a hot hand for a while there but you have to give it up for Poltl. He kept the team in there with a bunch of nice rebounds and put backs in the fourth quarter. 

The Spurs have the 2nd worst free throw percentage in the league and you saw why here tonight. There's just no excuse for not making those. 

It's back to reality with Carmelo. He had a great night against Memphis, but 4 points in 28 minutes is not going to cut it.

I'm not a fan of AD's shot selection at all. It's not a new thing, but he'd have so many more points if he hung out in the paint instead of at mid-range.",qgn48q,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers

Timmy wasn't as good as last game but still had a solid 16pts on solid shooting 👍👍

Maxi got in on the Bench Mob with 9pts/7rebs all off of 3's 👌💦💺🇩🇪

Bobi was huge in the 1st half keeping us connected with some rebounds/putbacks. Finished with 11pts in just 9min 💺🇷🇸👍

WE DID It. JOKIC tHE LEADING SCORER DESPItE ONLY PLAYING tHE 1St HALF,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
[deleted],qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
Jokic with the game high 24 points ... as expected,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
Man these two teams have been treating every game like a playoff game lately. I hate to see these bangs and bruises but it's entertaining.,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
Hope Jokic is okay. MPJ gotta get out of this funk,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
"As a nuggets fan, I’m just glad Joker is supposedly okay. We put up a fight even without our two best players so it is what it is.",qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz

"Serious question:  What is going on with Michael Porter Jr?  

I know it's only been four games but this is not the player we saw at the end of last season or even the player we saw in preseason.",qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
Jokic had a real nice stat line for playing only 15 minutes,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
Jokic is the only NBA player I truly fear,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
"In the race of undefeated teams who'll last the longest?

Bulls next 3: Knicks, Utah, Boston (away)

I like Hassan on our team.,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz

Is it just me or has Gobert been scoring way more so far,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
"Look forward to a healthy Joker when I go to see these guys in Denver in January.


Love this teams mentality. Whiteside looks bought in. Paschall looks bought in. Looking forward to being Gay for Gay",qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
Whiteside is doing really well in our system.,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
"All that really matters is that Jokic is okay. And I'm happy Morris is finding his legs. 


That said, I cannot imagine a more disappointing start to the season for MPJ. It's been clear since the beginning of last season that he needed to work on his handle if he was gonna be more than a spot up shooter. Mares has been harping out it forever...


And if we see it, than the coaches see it. Which means there is 0 excuses for the lack of improvement. He literally couldn't even dribble past Lauri last night. Not good. Kenny is talking about it as I type.  ""Michael is a finisher, not a creator right now""... you don't pay somebody a max to be a finisher. Especially when they are flawed on D.


That said, I don't buy that he is tuned out. His D was solid for most of the night. Lots of hustle plays. And his passing has been a lot better... granted the bar started on the floor.


Also, Malone is gonna escape heat because of the Jokic injury... but his flaws as a coach are rearing their head again. The offense makes no room for MPJ to find shots in rhythm with Jokic and looks completely rudderless without him. Meanwhile he continues to trot out that God awful 5 man lineup and leave Bones (who might already be the 3rd best shot creator on the team) on the bench.


Lastly, let Barton be okay. It's been so much fun watching his resurgence. ",qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
How was Jokic the top scorer in this game lmao,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz

Nuggs fans whats up with Gordon? What's his role on your team? He has 20 points but it's like it doesnt matter or sumn,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
Hopefully Malones bench unit improves as we get Murray back and Monte shifts down to bench role. Staggering minutes with MPJ and Murray with bench might also help. Right now tho that 5 men bench unit is a guaranteed -20 every night,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
The fuck was that double ejection loooollll,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz
Gobert finally figured out how to stop Jokic,qgojwa,Denver Nuggets,Utah Jazz

Miles Bridges is a monster! Side note: Ish that was disrespectful.,qhbliy,Charlotte Hornets,Orlando Magic
Miles Bridges is awesome,qhbliy,Charlotte Hornets,Orlando Magic
"LaMelo was horrible in all facets tonight. His finishing around the rim still leaves some to be desired. Can't rely on the three all season. 

Our defense forced turnovers. Nice. Unfortunately when we don't force a large amount of them (15+ ish) our D looks poor



---

Okay now the good stuff!

Miles man, just wowwww. Unbelievable. Complete power AND finesse around the rim. Them threes too...


 Gordo was horrible for around 1.5 quarters and then had a quiet and steady 24 points, so fair play! CoMart shot slowly looking actually legit. Jalen is our best defender and he better get minutes when Terry and PJ come back. Love how confident his open threes are this year.

I see some of ya’ll shit talking Suggs. He’s having a rough month of offense but the shots he’s taking ain’t bad — they’ll start to drop eventually.

He definitely needs to work on his handles. Man can’t get into the paint without losing the ball — but that was the knock on him in college. It’s not an easy fix or something that can improve over night but hopefully he works on that as his career progresses.

But as of rn, he shouldn’t be in situations where he’s handling the ball as much as he is. Leave that up to Cole and Markelle when he comes back.",qhbliy,Charlotte Hornets,Orlando Magic

Butler being better than Harden after the rule change was not on most people’s bingo card.,qhc732,Brooklyn Nets,Miami Heat
nets have a huge rebounding problem from last year which still hasn't been addressed and harden playing passive isn't going to get it done multiple times he has a layup but he passes to a role player who either misses or he gets a turnover,qhc732,Brooklyn Nets,Miami Heat

"For all of the focus Harden is getting (and it's deserved, don't get me wrong) the Nets have some serious underlying issues so far that, even if Harden is playing better, are big problems.

They are getting outshot by an average of 10 shots per game and the only game they haven't gotten destroyed on the offensive glass is their win against Philly.

It's going to be hard to be a great team if they continue to have -10 shots compared to their opponent on average.

Plz come back Kyrie,qhc732,Brooklyn Nets,Miami Heat
Cry me a river Harden,qhc732,Brooklyn Nets,Miami Heat
"The Nets primary issue thus far boils down to the fact that they're missing about 35PPG. 

Harden needs to be scoring 10 more PPG, and the rule change doesn't excuse missing out on that scoring. He should be able to find those points anyway, he is literally one of the best scorers ever. He just needs to be better. Adjust to the rule changes and be more aggressive. It will take time but he just has to be better than 15 PPG. 

And then of course they're missing 25 PPG from Kyrie. I don't know what to expect any more about that situation, whether he will be back at any point or not. But he has totally screwed his team. Pure and simple. He is a huge part of this team and he left them in the dirt for some godforsaken. And now they are figuring out on the fly how to adjust without a 25 PPG scorer. A scorer who, by the way, would have no issues at all adjusting to these new rules because he never has been one to rely on the old rules.

We could get into the rebounding issues and their preference to treat this like its still preseason, but ultimately it boils down to Harden needing to be better and Kyrie disappearing.",qhc732,Brooklyn Nets,Miami Heat

There is zero (0) excuse as to why a team like this should be blowing 20 point leads to the worst (and youngest) team in the league. The defense is non-existent and the offense doesn't inspire confidence either. At least last years team had an identity in their elite defense.

It’s so crazy to me that we have a bench that actually gains and builds leads rather than blowin em.,qhexqx,Portland Trail Blazers,Memphis Grizzlies

"2 very good wins

2 very bad losses

Team is making rotation mistakes all over but at least there's promise.  With no Powell and Dame shooting like Westbrook I don't feel terrible at 2-2.  We also have the hardest first 20 games in the league",qhexqx,Portland Trail Blazers,Memphis Grizzlies
Ant is playing extremely well,qhexqx,Portland Trail Blazers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Besides the offball movement, the defensive rotations, the diverse lineups, I honestly think my favorite thing about this team so far, is seeing Dame on the bench with 6 min left watching the young guys get actual run in a game. Instead of Stotts playing dame until the final 90 seconds down by 30.",qhexqx,Portland Trail Blazers,Memphis Grizzlies
"Ja has some of that old man game/vet experience game to him. Getting defenders to attach to his hip and hesitating long enough to expose the big and capable of making every pass out of it.

Dudes special",qhexqx,Portland Trail Blazers,Memphis Grizzlies

"If JJJ could get consistent with his shooting, we'll be in a pretty good place. Until then, it's going to be a tossup at best. 3-13 is downright pathetic.",qhexqx,Portland Trail Blazers,Memphis Grizzlies
god I wish I could sign a hundred million dollar deal and spend every day launching hilariously bad three after three,qhexqx,Portland Trail Blazers,Memphis Grizzlies
On the Cavs I wondered why we played other guys over Larry Nance.  Now on the blazers I’m wondering why they play other guys over Larry Nance.,qhexqx,Portland Trail Blazers,Memphis Grizzlies
"I’m mad about that elbow not getting a foul. The ref was looking right at them!

Whatever, that wasn’t the reason why they lost. It sucks but they just didn’t have it. JJJ and Melt had bad games, Ja had an ok one and Bane was great. 

Just need to be more consistent.",qhexqx,Portland Trail Blazers,Memphis Grizzlies

"With Lauri Markkanen as their primary defense in the past 3 games, Paul George was 6 of 20 for 12 points, MPJ was 4 of 14 with 11 points and Deandre Hunter was 2-11 with 8 points.",qhf6uw,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Clippers

That’s three wins in a row against playoff teams,qhf6uw,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Clippers
"Who knew you could build an elite team defense with Lauri Markkanen playing the three? All of Finland, that's who. 

Helps to have the absolute defensive monster of Evan Mobley on the floor too, haha.",qhf6uw,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Clippers
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe only five players in NBA history were on the All-Defensive Team in their rookie season.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (22 years old)

Hakeem Olajuwon (22 years old)

Manute Bol (23 years old)

David Robinson (24 years old)

Tim Duncan (21 years old)

None of them were first team, all of them were second.

Evan Mobley could seriously flirt with it at just 20 (!!?) years old. No Kawhi this year opens up a spot. First team is (probably?) out of the question, but I really think second team is in play. He's completely transformed the Cavs defense. Defends the paint, blocks shots, guards the perimeter, sticks with guys in space, doesn't foul. The footwork, and the way he uses his body is so advanced for his age. He looks like a multi-year vet.

Like, holy shit. I'm in love with this guy.",qhf6uw,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Clippers

Dont get too high dont get too low. Remember with our best player its going to be rough.  On top of that our match up  vs teams with quality bigs is our worse match up. DeAndre defeated us. Jjj and steven adams hurt us. Today we had kevin love evan mobley and Jarrett allen stop us. They stopped jokic. Then shifty small guards is another weakness for us so sexland is an issue. Cavs are pretty much our kryptonite for sure. I hope we can get to 500 by all star break though.,qhf6uw,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Clippers

I've been thinking lately that it's possible that the latest rule changes may be ushering us into a new era of grit and grind basketball. And I think this game was a prime example. IMO the teams that have looked the strongest so far this year and (and most exciting to watch) all have one thing in common - mentally tough players that aren't afraid to play aggressive defense, scrap for every board, run you up and down on **every** play, and drive on you in the paint. And I don't think that's a coincidence.",qi2ogm,New York Knicks,Chicago Bulls

">Here's your Dallas Mavs Post Game Summary. Now in our 6th Season. 6️⃣

Did the Mavs win? ✅ 

Kidd's 3rd win as the new Mavs Head Coach 📋🏆

Mavs really started the game down 5-25 and proceeded to go on a 31-4 run...🐎

Luka had a really slow start to the game with not even 2 assists in the first half. Eventually started to get things going making 8 straight shots and finished with 25/3/5 🇸🇮🐌🔥

After some solid games, Timmy had an off night only making 2 shots 🧱

KP was out tonight with lower back tightness. No word on if he plays tomorrow against Denver yet. 🇱🇻🦄🏥

Doe Doe with 14/8 with 2 Steals and 3 3's 👌💦

Dwight with a solid 11pts 👍7️⃣
 
Bench Analysis 💺⤵️

Brunson Burner was the MVP for much of the game on offense with 19/7/5 & knocking down 3 3's to lead the bench in scoring 💺♨️👌💦

Maxi was the MVP on the defensive end tonight with some pivotal defensive plays all night finishing with a 12/10 double double all off of 4 3's and a whopping 6 Blocks. 👌💦💺🔥🛡️✋✋✋✋✋✋✋

Frank with 6/4 in 13min knocking down 2 3's 💺🇫🇷👌

Gotta say this team has looked shaky so far on offense, but our defense has looked much better so far. Hopefully the same case tomorrow but with better offense out of the gate against the Nuggets ⛰️",qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks
That game was so weird. Brunson bailed us out in the first half so much.,qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks
"It’s like the crew said, we have no one who we can trust to get us out of slumps. Lonnie is the closest we had to that tonight

also 4th quarter Doncic is unfair",qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks
Competitive tanking by the Spurs. Keep games close but still lose.,qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks
Kleber had such a great game. 4 Threes 6 Blocks and 10 Boards man was really doing it all.,qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks
"Things to like:

We strapped in and after being down 25-5 came back. 

Jalen is looking GREAT! If he can be a secondary ball handler and do 16/4/6 then that’s what we need. I’ve said for over a year now he has the potential to be Kyle Lowry.

Maxi! Looked great! He won’t do that every game but he always brings defense and can score

The defense as a whole looked very good and has post hawks. I saw deflections, tipped balls, steals, blocks, shot clock violations, and even just really good man defense from guys that knocked the Spurs out of rhythm

Luka shot pretty well besides…

God damn free throws! We play again tomorrow but at our next practice each guy shouldn’t be allowed to leave until they make 100 this is ridiculous. If we were 10/14 (72%) we win this game by 10 points. Ugh.

The team still hasn’t quite found their rhythm yet, but we’re 3-1, I’ll take it",qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks
I'll take an ugly win any day over an ugly loss.,qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks
I have never felt so uncomfortable with starting 3-1.,qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks

Some classic 19-20 spurs here. Nice.,qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks
i thought it was weird that they only played 3 quarters of basketball tonight but the mavs did good in all 3 of them so haha no harm no foul right,qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks
"Brunson got them in this game,luka brought it home.Man i have nothing against Dwight Powell but i am so fucking pissed every time i see him on the court,why doesnt kid give a chance to the new kid Brown he cant be worst than Dwight he is not a guy for a starting line up,hell i wouldnt put him on a second unit,i dont know man,2 offensive fouls in last 5 minutes from him were Dwight special,but maybe its just me guys?",qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks

"I love the start DJ and Poeltl have made to the season. Vassell is improving and Lonnie as well.

We know Keldon is going to go through a learning curve as people have seen his tape from last year and game planned to stop him now that he is a big deal. It’s on him to use other facets of his game.

My biggest concern is Derricks game, he has looked out of sync to start the season. We won’t win any games if he does not join the party.",qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks
Maxi and Brunson! This is a blowout loss without them tonight. Frank's defense played a big part in our 20 point comeback too.,qi2zfe,San Antonio Spurs,Dallas Mavericks

Blew a 19 point lead bruh,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies

On the bright side, we're still technically undefeated when Moody plays. Ye let's go with that.",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"Ziaire didn't show up on the box score but I was really impressed with him tonight. Showed flashes of elite defense and a glimpse of being able to create his own shot. Defensively with him, Bane, and Brooks we can be competitive on that end of the floor with anyone.

Also about out to Deanthony Melton, dude played out of his mind. 

Lastly DAMN JA",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
We deserved to lose this one.,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies

"GSW plays the version of basketball where everyone in the team seems to know their role very well, except in pressure situations. If you're going to rely so much on Curry that late in the game you're not going to win many close games regardless of how Curry has played throughout the game.

EDIT: Props to Ja, Lee, and Memphis defense in OT",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
Ja is getting all the attention (and for good reason) but Desmond Bane has been quietly very good in the absence of Brooks. 19pts on close to 50/40/90 shooting so far this season,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies

"Morant is too quick haha. Couldn't even foul him at the end of the game. Great start to the year for him.

The Warriors super small lineup was not able to provide help at the rim and he just BBQ chickened people 1 on 1.

"Dubs played sloppy as hell with the TO's, Kerr held Curry out for way too long in the 4th and then Chef just went cold af in the 4th/OT too. He was too passive, imo. Should've done what Ja was doing and take to the lane.",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies

Fuck Iggy party,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"Steve Kerr definitely wasn’t chasing wins tonight with how long he had Steph on the bench in the 4th. This team looks like last years warriors with how much they were getting outscored when he was on the bench

In all seriousness though, what the hell has gotten into Steph the last few 4th quarters? He was lighting it up the first 3 then just... faded away. DLee the reason the game didn’t end in the 4th and OT was even close. 

Ja was insane in the 2nd half. I pretty much wrote him off at halftime for having a bad game but he delivered for sure. That deep 3 in crunch time was one of the best shots of the season so far

This game has so many similarities to the play in game. Warriors blow lead with Steph on the bench, Ja comes out hot in the 2nd half to force OT, Steph and Warriors struggle in OT.",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
JJJ locking up Steph? 👀,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
Just here to pay my respects to the Griz. To come back from down 19 on the second road game of a back to back and win in OT? Damn. Them kids got juice.,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
why sit curry for 8 minutes in the fourth,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
Leggggggggoooo Grizz!! Great comeback and great defensive effort. Ja is a true star⭐,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"Kerr holds Steph out during a time out with 6:30 left; doesn't end up getting him in until 4 minutes left already down by 3.

It's such a dumb decision that he does time and time again. 

You force him to come in that late and attempt heroics and then it doesn't work out and you actually just forced him to play an extra 5 minutes of OT",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"Not many teams make Steph work harder than Memphis 

He was exhausted at the end there",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies

"Warriors threw that game away. Terrible shooting from Steph (he isn't going to be MVP with games like this) and constant turnovers from the warriors.

For a team that wanted revenge on the Grizzlies, that was incredibly sloppy.",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"Curry carried until he couldn’t

Only help he had was Lee, everyone else had random points throughout the game

The supporting cast and Draymond were BAD",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
I hope Curry reads all these talk shits lol. He needs to be criticized with his 4th quarter performance (s).,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
Ja is quick asf,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies

Ik curry played shit in the 4th and ot but why did Kerr sit him till the 4 min mark? Is that when he normally comes in?,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"All credit to the Grizz, Ja is a flat out baller. This game made me realize the dubs are a pretty lucky to even be 4-1. Every game so far has just been very up and down. Need to find a way to sustain throughout. 4Q Curry is not it either.",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"Bruh you don’t win with 30+ turnovers, was really hoping Poole would have a revenge game. I also think dray one can’t be scoring only 4pts. Good game grizzlies! Fucking love ja tho dude is a beast. I can see him winning MVP one day",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"Even if it is curry, you can’t make him sit in the bench for 10 mins and ask him to win the game at last",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
Ja Morant,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"So Kerr once again letting the hottest player get cold with almost 7 straight minutes on the bench, then said cold player shoots us out of the game with his mamba mentality.",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"Man our turnover problem is staggering, especially considering we definitely play really well when we aren’t giving it away. 

Grizz played solidly but I think we win that easily in reg if we don’t do things like commit unforced 8s violations when the game is tied.",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
Lose by 3 points in overtime in your first loss of the season? Must be trash 🤷🏻‍♂️,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
ja rule got us tonight.. good stuff grizz,qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"This game felt a lot like last year. There are no real offensive options on this team other than Steph Curry. Lee can get hot from three from time to time, but just not reliable enough. Wiggins is not reliable down the stretch, never was. If Steph gets cold, it's over. 

Same shit, different year. Myers needs to make some moves.",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"On the other hand, look at how bad the warriors had to play to lose by one possession in overtime 👀",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies

"Say what you want, Steph had a great game. Any time he gets off 29 shots, it's a win in my book",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies

"The good: Deantony Allen

The bad: Jaren Parsons Jr? 

The glorious: Kyle blocks Iggy to seal it",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"Warriors' scheme last night was a russian roullete. Fast pace all time, Draymond basically decided he is an old Ben Simmons with no offensive threat whatsoever (being wide open and not even a threat on the perimeter), a lot of off-ball movement and antecipation pass which caused a shit ton of turnovers.

This game remember me a lot of there matchup in the play-in, and again, Wiggins isn't treated as the second scoring option after Steph which was already tired (love him so much to say he choked)",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies
"Box score kinda tells the tale. GSW needed more O, in the end. Hard to win when you just got 3 players in double figures…1 of which being a bench player",qi4r1t,Golden State Warriors,Memphis Grizzlies

Glad Suggs had a good game — had a feeling he would against Toronto. It was fun watching him and Scottie go at it.

GG Raps.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

An amazing showcase of Barnes and Suggs.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Cole Anthony is a fucking problem.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
I'm here to talk about our Defensive Lord and Savior GARY TRENT JR.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Tbh the bench saved our ass. Magic bench is currently the 3rd stringers. They actually aren't as bad as you'd expect once they get back Isaac, Fultz and Okeke",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Game Notes  
- Scottie Barnes may arguably be the best rookie in the league, but Dalano Banton might be the best 2nd rounder.  
- Suggs is the truth. Stop hating on that young man. Almost beat our ass single-handedly  
- Dragic getting no PT is great for the team. Let our young guys develop.  
- Gary Trent Jr is scary when he gets to the rim, and these steals are amazing (averaging 2.5 on the season!)  
- Chris Boucher finally had a good game.  
- Mo Bamba is officially good at basketball this season.  
- Cole Anthony will be the bane of our existence one day (DJ Augustin vibes)",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Scottie killed it in the first half and Suggs killed it in the second.. both are special,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"This team just makes me happy man. Not the most talented Raps squad I've seen, but probably the most hardworking and tenacious. So satisfying watching 5 guys giving maximum effort at once.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Can't wait until we have Fultz, Isaac, and Chuma back. We always give up leads when we go to the bench.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Gary is that dude. I'm so happy rn,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"GG

Cole Anthony was fucking legit",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Suggs almost put us to bed after those Scottie Better chants. Hopefully that’ll teach this fanbase to stop obsessing about him. Hopefully.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Suggs revenge game goddamn that was too close would have been so embarrassing,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
My heart was racing that last minute tf,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
That was unnecessarily close.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Tough shooting night for Wagner but all the rooks on both sides looked pretty solid overall,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"OG almost gave Suggs the revenge game. Also wtf is up with this team, Scottie legit had like, 4 or 5 shots in the 2nd half, we aren't gonna win games ignoring the guy shooting the best and scoring the best on the team.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

"Great game by both teams and the rookies.
Looked like a flagrant foul on that last Suggs three, a very similar one was called in the first half. But oh well, still an exciting finish",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
This raptors team is going to be tough for most teams as they are very good defensively and lots of very reliable shooters on the roster as well,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Magic young players playing good and a loss for the tank. Win for them honestly.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Damn. Obviously wanted the win. But still love to see the top draft picks putting on a show tonight. Can’t wait for the next one. GG’s Raps.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"I’m so hyped for the Magic’s future, If Suggs can become more consistent and Franz can continue to do what he does and take steps next year and we get a high draft pick which are all possible we will be solid in a couple seasons. All we need is Kelle and JI back because we got SHOOTERS now.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Scottie Barnes -13 and Jalen Suggs +7. Sorry Raps fans, but this debate is settled.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Barnes and Suggs are so good,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Jalen Suggs is a demon in the clutch, that kid is special man. Wagner hooping too, my fuckin heart is still pumping. These Scottie games are starting to feel normal which is crazy. Back to .500 lets go!",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Hopefully this ends dumb Raptors fans clowning on Suggs to hype Barnes up. It was embarrassing then and even more embarrassing now,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
CLOSE ONE BOYS,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Gary Trent Jr saved the game!,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
GTJ's hustle on defense to get those steals has definitely been on display the last few games,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

that is all",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

man raptors fans really show out on Reddit man. There are 100 comments in 4 minutes on a random raptors magic post game thread in October,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"- That was closer than it should have been. 
- Barnes could have hit 30 if teammates actually passed him when he was open instead of the constant hero ball.
- Suggs almost won Orlando the game after the trashy fans started the hate chants. Keep it positive (unless it is Pat Bev).
- The refs were decent this game.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Jeremy Lamb nearly entered the chat at the end,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

GTJ with the clamps,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Barnes and Suggs both went off. These gon be special,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Got PTSD from the Jeremy Lamb game winner when Cole Anthony took the shot 😭,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
I knew Suggs was gonna suddenly find his shot against us lmao.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
I feel like since Orlando had the momentum they shouldn’t have called a timeout at the end there.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"As someone who has watched some Magic games in passing but hasn't been paying super close attention: How big of a jump has this been for Bamba this year, Orlando fans? It feels like he's a damned good MIP candidate from a distance.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Fuckin Gary what a pest,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Who called time out? I suppose Mosley? Magic were blazing hot and had a 1 vs 1 in transition with 7s on the clock. If you dont find the angle, plenty of time to  call a time out. Have to trust your players there.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Good game Magic bros! Suggs sure is spooky!,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
I’m convinced Barnes is a legitimate Roy candidate / front runner,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"C’mon Toronto fans. The ‘Scotties better’ chant is totally classless. Suggs wanted to be a raptor, not his fault you guys didn’t draft him. Between that and cheering when KD got hurt … not great looks for Raps fans.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"OG has to be better in those final 2 minutes.. really let us down there, lucky to get away with the W",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Scottie Barnes will win a MVP one day,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

"Hell of a game by both rookies, way too early to say one is better than the other",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Shoutout Scottie and GTJ

I’m really glad Suggs had a good game, he needed it. He was looking like Killian Hayes for a minute. 

Both rookies will be great players",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Nothing wrong with Scottie is better chant. He is better than other guy for sure. Suggs seems okay but not on Scottie’s level. Scottie just forced one half and dropped 19 :),qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
I don’t know what it is about Raps fans on Reddit but there is absolutely nothing wrong with the “Barnes is better” chants. Man some of you people here are so ridiculous and think that fans can’t have fun cheering and everyone has to be nice to each other. Get outside nerds it’s just for fun.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Raptor fans are embarrassing,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
This game was so stressful. Magic start hitting some wild 3s to get back in the game.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
GTJ clamps,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Orlando had probably their best shooting night of the season, FVV and OG sucked for 3 quarters, still won.

Hats off to the Magic, they have some decent prospects. Suggs is no Barnes but he looks like he'll be a solid PG in this league.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

Damn I thought Eric Thomas was Jordan Peele for a hot second there,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Not even close bby, my mini heart attack at the end means nothing! 

Great to see both of the rooks getting along and playing fantastically, think both teams really got one, this draft class is too legit.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Gary Trent Jr with the absolute brilliant and critical defence at the end. Also, Banton is looking better and better each game. Barnes and Banton are going to be a problem.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
The Raptors tried their hardest to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Where is the other half of the Magic roster?!,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Gary Trent Jr putting the clamps on in crunch time as literally every Raptors fan predicted.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

I love Scottie Barnes hype trainnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn! Woo woo! All aboard!,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

So bad it's like Magic heyoo,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Raptors = 11 steals

Magic = 1 steal",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
I can’t believe we’re the only team that lost to Orlando.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"Suggs was thriving in the clutch, hitting 3’s, looked fast as hell with the ball, and he was locking up raptor players. As a raptor fan this looked like the guy that I fantasized about drafting after reading all those mock drafts that had him at 4.",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
"I look forward to the eventual Suggs, Green, Barnes super team",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
D-REX FINISHED A GAME!! WOOOO!!!,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

No",qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic

good lord Torontos rookies play big minutes,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Can someone else lose to them so we’re not their only win,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
No excuses why Orlando should lose. They should have won! These fourth quarter turnovers ruined it again. The Orlando Magic offically are the worst team in the NBA. I want this franchise to crumble. They will relocate to Montreal to Stu Sternberg.,qir4tt,Toronto Raptors,Orlando Magic
Miami is scary.,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Man Miami that defense holy shit,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
"score 100 points against the heat challenge

not so fast, NBA",qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
"Man I’m so excited for our offense to click once Kyle and Duncan get their rhythms back.

This was a good test, I honestly think last season’s team would have ended up losing this one but we were able to keep steady and stop the comeback.

Heat Culture is back on the menu, boys.",qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
"Heat defense looks outstanding right now, I would really like to see Lowry score more but if you have Bam/Herro/Jimbo scoring 25+ each you don't really need that. Herro has looked like an all-star level player this season (coming off the bench no less) with only 1 mild game so far.",qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Tyler Herro is a fucking bucket,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
##JIMBO,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Bam has been playing some of the best basketball I've ever seen from him.,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
"this heat defense + kyle lowry getting into rhythm on offense will be a serious contender to make it out of the east. i’m not sure they aren’t already a real contender man, they made us look like kids at times. Bam is legit, Jimmy is legit, Tyler herro killed us. I will say, the hornets 2 years ago or even last year would have absolutely just given up. glad to see the team actually have some fight up until the end. GG Heat, y’all earned that.",qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Apologize to Tyler Herro,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
HEAT DANDO PAN CON PINGA,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
"Butler is casually dropping 30 point games now that he doesn't have to play point guard all game. He finds so many creative ways to attack opposing defenses.

Bam is grabbing damn near every rebound now too.

And Herro could be an allstar off the bench if Miami is the 1st seed headed into allstar break. Easy 6MOY.",qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Heat are legit contenders. Duncan Robinson shooting like prime rondo and their still beating teams handily. Once the shooters get going it’s gonna be scary,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Alright Kyle and Duncan nice prank guys now please start hitting shots again…,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Heat hold the #1 offence in the league to just 99 points. Love to see it,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets

60-37 total rebounds lol,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Herro comin for 6MOY,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Heat look dangerous af. And Herro is starting to look for real.,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
"Go up by 26 in first half. Lead gets cut to 4 in the turd quarter. Win by 15 and hold team under 100.

Classic Heat game",qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Tyler leading 6moty so far surely. Game has slowed down for him so much. Bam and jimmy were absolute beasts today,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
This team is dangerous as hell especially when jimmy butler is playing like this,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Tyler Herro is the type of guy to take a screenshot of all the hate comments on his IG and read it before every game for motivation.,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Tyler hero is who Jordan Poole thinks he is.,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
"Another outstanding win. I still have my reservations. Our 3-ball has been piss poor. If we were 1-4 instead of 4-1, I'm pretty sure Duncan and Lowry would be  piñata's in our sub. Dunc's is understandable, *every* team that pays their 3pt specialist will get frustrated with them on an off night(BKN - Joe Harris, WAS - Davis Bertans, etc...) 

But I hope Lowry gets going eventually. He hasn't scored 10pts in a game for us yet. Kinda reminds me of Mike Conley's woeful start with Utah a few years back. At least he can contribute in other aspects. 

Regardless, Bam's a rebounding machine, Herro is an electric scorer off the bench, and I love Markieff Morris.",qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Good shit from the Hornets. You guys are a great team and i look forward to playing you three more times. You caught us off guard last season but we won’t underestimate you again!,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Where the Herro haters at? 👀,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets

When Jimmy's landing those ugly flat arc jumpers it's all over,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
I hope our ownership is ready to go deep on the luxury tax because if Tyler keeps going like this he's going to get **paid**,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
tyler herro,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets

But his stats look pretty bad.",qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Herro has receipts on everybody,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Tyler Herro 6MOTY is gonna make me so much money 😂😂. I am Lakers fan but man do i want Tyler herro to have 50 point games against us.,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
I need the people who said Jimmy would average 15 from the new rules to come to the stage,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
This should be a blowout throughout the game if Duncan doesn't have that shooting slump.,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets

Duncan played like total shit Jesus Christ. Good w though,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets

"Man when you have Butler, Bam, and Herro all playing lights out basketball. What do you even do.",qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
"The return of the turd quarter but that first half was phenomenal.

Bam should win DPOY, MIP, All-NBA.",qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
"I really like what Bridges and Gordon brought to the table. Bridges started off slow but kept attacking when it would've been easy to throw in the towel in the end.

Miami Kennel,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Lowry adds so much to this team. No Jimmy can play his game & just ball out. Doesn’t have to facilitate or play PG. Bam finally realized this year he can dominate the boards lol. Tyler is balling out like all of us Heat fans knew he could. Defense is fucking unbelievable so far. We’re spooky.,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets
Man i hope we get miami vs bucks part 3 in the playoff,qirni7,Miami Heat,Charlotte Hornets

Just has to get in rhythm, he’s so out of it he’s made some sloppy plays losing the ball on the drive in the 4th, which definitely was less common last year.

"What I have taken from the last two weeks:

Lakers need to limit switches and play more zone D, when they do this they are successful. 
The Russ-Reaves-Melo/baze-AD-Howard lineup is a good one and has good chemistry. 
The Bron-Russ-Melo-Ad-Howard lineup is going to be deadly once they do 3 things:

1) primary ball handlers lear to attack off ball
2) players are okay responding to other players routes without clogging the paint and catching mismatches
3) they settle more into the pass-attack balance. There are A LOT of iso players who are SO EAGER to fit into the new system they are sharing the ball TOO MUCH and causing turnovers.

This happens and it's a wrap",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers

"Carmelo Anthony is a joy to watch when he's on. Fucking swished most of his shots tonight.

LeBron looked rusty shooting but every time he goes to the rim it's money in the bank.

Russ had his good moments tonight and was important when LeBron went to the bench in the third, he had some stupid passes that were saved by his teammates in the 1st but he improved from there. If he plays like he did tonight, the Lakers will be just fine.

AB was great on defense, Reeves had some solid minutes although he committed some mistakes but he's a rookie, it's natural.

AD might be averaging 28/12 but in certain games it just feels like he's not that guy, I guess injuries have affected him and it might take a while for him to trust himself again. Him sharing the court with another center clearly doesn't help though. 

Vogel should never ever play AD and DJ together, the Lakers looked like a high school team with those two and actually good simply with AD.

Mobley looks fantastic",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers

Dwight Howard and DJ were so important in gaining those second chances buckets to help us keep the lead.

**Positives**: focus and effort for the last 3 quarters, very strong defensively in the fourth. Carmelo Anthony and LeBron. Dwight Howard hit a three.

**Negatives**: We still need to defend the pick and roll better. We need to start the game sharper, and relax on our turnovers.",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers

Aint no way lebron losing to the cavaliers,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
The panic was widely overrated,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
"Aside from the obvious where the lakers need to reduce turnovers, my biggest takeaway from this game is that they need to move the ball more on offense. They end up playing Iso too much and putting themselves in a bad spot.

They also need to shore up the help side defense on pick and roll coverage.

From a fan perspective, because of the way they play and rely on transition, their offense/defense swing together. If one is good, the other is good too. If one is bad, the other is also bad. This results in bigger runs and swings than usual and some patience is needed.

Unlike a lot of people, I don’t have any particular issues with any players or lineups the Lakers run, most of their major issues extend towards multiple players. Changing one player’s role in the rotation does not fix or explain their issues. I’d still give it a lot more time before hitting the panic button.

The Cavs had their share of cold streaks and turnovers too, partially due to good Laker defense in spurts especially in the 4th, so Lakers were able to pull it out after a back and forth game

Interesting Bradley took all of Monk’s minutes this game. Not sure if it was because the team played so bad in the 4 minutes he was on the court or if it was because he was sick. Bradley has more than deserved all his minutes so far though.

Lebron’s cold shooting night from 3 was offset by Melo’s super efficient 24 after a brief first half stint. Also Westbrook had a nice efficient game. 3 early turnovers in Q1 and only one more the rest of the game and shot 8/13 for 19/6/5. Lebron was actually the bigger culprit with 7 turnovers and 1/10 from 3.

End of the 3rd and the 4th quarter was great to watch and reminiscent of the 2020 Lakers team with their defense. Very encouraging for the Lakers",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
"Wonder what would happen if we just ran the following lineups in a cycle

LeBron & AD PNR + 3 shooters,

It’s funny when you realize Austin Reaves is the best player on the Lakers,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers

Why did Rubio shoot so much in the 3rd lol,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Damn Melo get it.,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Stupid turnovers and poor execution in the 2nd half cost us this one. Also Melo going straight flamethrower mode on us didn't help.,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
"Dwight ""Steph Curry"" Howard at the end",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers

Melo is the 4th star 🤫",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers

"Dwight splashing in a 3 in the dying seconds.

CARMELO ANTHONNNNNY,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
"AB with the +30 game, second highest +11. Honestly no idea what the rotation is going to look like with Reaves and Bradley playing so well, Monk seems like he might lose minutes which he won't be happy with considering he took a paycut to be with the Lakers. Somebody tell me how Baze gets minutes, guy is not completely average or below on both sides and has no IQ

Not to mention Nunn/Ellington coming back.. Lakers should pump up trade value for the guards then trade for better wings",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
"Man, as much as how big of an improvement Kuz had while he was with the Lakers, I wished he played somewhat like how Melo was playing. Of course Kuz might be better for that role because of his improved defense and hustle on the glass when he's locked in. Hopefully Melo could sustain this efficient scorer off the bench role.",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Sign Bradley for the rest of the season! He proved his worth,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
We win games when Melo is hot,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Dwight and Melo was our best 3 point shooters,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers

"This game was up and down, only at the end of 4th quarter he could finally guess whos gonna win.",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
LeBron hit 1 3-pointer out of 10 and it was from miles out.,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Oh my Cedi.,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Can't wait for Mobley's further development. The man is already a menace.,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Why is Mobley listed as a small forward?,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Lebron made 1 of 10 three pointers.The only one made was from the logo. Lol,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Man I fucking love Melo when he plays well.,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
So is Cedi not good?,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Avery Bradley with a +30 lmao,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Never seen a team insist on not playing their obvious best lineups as these Lakers. Unbelievable.,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Lakers finally getting their head in the game,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
"They lost the first quarter and won the next three. 

Exact opposite of what happened in OKC.",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
STAPLES CENTER MELO,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Guess Draymond and Curry was right about Avery...at least in some game...,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Lebron took 10 3s lol,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Mobley's a beast.,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Melo went 6-8 from 3 again is amazing,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Sucks,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
"Russ when OKC scored at the end with the lead: 
“When shit like that happens I don't let it slide. ... There's certain things you just don't do in sports. Game already over and I didn't like it. Simple as that.”

Russ when his team does the same thing: 🥳

Beautiful 3 tho",qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Can’t wait for the Pelicans are going to have a Top 3 pick thanks to the Lakers takes to come out again the next time we lose,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers
Austin Reaves is already a good NBA player.,qiu951,Cleveland Cavaliers,Los Angeles Lakers

Stark contrast between a Kuzma led team and a Tatum led team,qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics
If you told me last year the wizards would be a better offensive team than the Celtics I would call bullshit. Jalen and Tatum seem incapable of running anything other than iso. Some quarters its both of them running iso of each other and they are not good enough yet to pull it of consistently. They work hard for every point they get so it's no mystery they always look gassed and uninterested by the fourth. Idk what is the head coach doing because this is the same issue they had last year,qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics
It's getting close to time to put Bill Simmons on suicide watch.,qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics

Was at game. Tatum and Brown combined for five measly assists in a double OT game. They do not play together and take turns at hero ball one on one. Very boring and will not serve them well. Was also quite gross how many Boston fans were in the stands.,qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics
Offense was terrible today but that weird coach’s challenge call really turned the momentum,qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics

"Tell me if I'm being too homer but that Tatum block on Harrel in first OT was not a foul, and the overturn on Tatum's drive was a foul as well.

For the rest we actually played pretty decent I thought, stayed in the game even though we had a terrible 3pt shooting night. Liked Richardson's energy, Horfords defense was good, Brown played well. Just really hurts to lose like this for the 2nd time in 6 games.",qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics

"Any Celtics fan blaming the refs is an idiot but anyone saying the refs didn't play a part here in some capacity is equally moronic.

That being said, and I know this will sounds like sour grapes, but I cannot fathom why there isn't a time limit on reviews in any sport. If after a minute or something you see nothing conclusive enough to overturn, then the original call should stand. In basketball, soccer, football, hockey, baseball, tennis, every sport.",qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics

"As a Cs fan, Tatum's bad habits he picked up from Kobe are becoming worse 30+ shots, less than 30 points. I'm not concerned about the team, but it does feel like every year we take a step back despite the talent we have. Kobe and Mike both averaged near 30 shots, they both averaged 35+, Tatum isn't those guys despite how much he thinks he is. We're good enough to stay in games, but we can never finish them.",qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics

Are the Celtics the best 2-4 team right now?,qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics
Ah the Kuzma effect,qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics
"The Wizards this year are showing the full Russ experience this year. As soon as Russ left the team significantly improved, they now lost way less dumb ball, Spencer Dinwiddie are a far better complementary piece for Beal, and overall the stole 3 useful player for a washed-up bad fit Westbrook... 

I expect them been easily in the playoffs this season and they will also compete for the second round, unlike last season.",qje0so,Washington Wizards,Boston Celtics

Jamaal Mosley had been one of the worst coaches so far this year.  I get our bench is bad but that just means just have to play the starters 34 plus minutes each game and learn to properly stagger them.  Suggs was awesome on defense.  His effort is ridiculous and whenever he is out the game we luck lost.  Also Mo Bamba is just a bad defensive player.  He needs to be on the bench because we struggle to score on the second unit and that's his best asset.  WCJ needs to play more.  Idk if he is hurt.  But it's frustrating watching winnable games fall away.  If Cliff was coach  he wouldn't have let these games slip away because bad defensive players wouldn't get any minutes.,qjf61n,Detroit Pistons,Orlando Magic
"It is embarrassing watching the magic play. They have so much young talent and they are wasting them. If they don’t want to actually try to win games, they should just disband from the league.

They should also stop selling season tickets for the next 10 years until they are actually ready to win",qjf61n,Detroit Pistons,Orlando Magic

His handle is already looking better and he is defending at a really high level. You guys always move the goalposts.

How TF is Scottie Barnes the LEADING SCORER for Raptors again. Wow he's exceeded all expectations.,qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers
Scottie Barnes is indeed a good basketball player,qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers
Scottie was 1 for 4 from the free throw line then comes in and hits 2 clutch free throws.  That man is a star in the making,qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers
I do not miss the Tampa Bay Raptors in any way.,qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers

Scotty holding his hand and having somebody else take the headset off for him in the post game interview has me worried,qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers
can we stop letting the other team come back in the last 2 minutes of the game,qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers
Mad respect to Matt Devlin for continuing to commentate on a sore throat. He was working off three packs of Fisherman's Friend and a honey tea 😂,qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers

Chris Duarte is really good too i had no idea who he was before this,qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers
Feeling bad for Carlisle. Indiana management is very stubborn as they have been trying to compete for all years after Paul George trade. Lavert-TJ Warren etc would only make this team a 7th seed. They lack no 1 and no 2 guy to build around. Sabonis would be 3rd and Myles Turner can be 4th guy in a winning team.,qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers

Scottie Barnes ROTY!,qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers
"The Raptors are a young team with a lot of new players, they are learning to play with each other and they are starting to come together with some chemistry. The bench unit is also starting to come together as well.Whan Siakam and Yuta come back they will be much better and deeper as well. Barnes, Siakam and OG should be something on both sides of the ball",qjfk1q,Toronto Raptors,Indiana Pacers

"Tremendous defensive effort from Thybulle kept the hawks from making a run in the second half (can someone smarter than me make a composition of all his steals/blocks/deflections?)

Niang has also been such a nice addition to this team, brings a nice bit of defense, passing, and shooting of course. That one pull up three off a Drummond screen was wild!

Reddish looked real nice tho, dude hit tough baskets over and over again. Nice to see him putting it together, his defense is already formidable. 

Early game Deandre Hunter post ups on curry didn’t seem to work out, nice to see the help defense come out quick and strong early on.",qjfm1r,Philadelphia 76ers,Atlanta Hawks

"I feel like coming into tonight most of us thought: ""2nd night of a back-to-back on the road, no Bam, AND playing a young Grizzlies team? This could very easily be a schedule L.""

and then *that* happened. 

3-ball was unconscious after sucking the last 5 games. I'm gonna be a bit bold and say this is the best Heat start to a season since the Big 3 era. It's not just the fact we're 5-1. We're **demolishing** our competition.

what a wild ending,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Unless I heard it incorrectly, it seemed like the Wolves announcers were implying KAT does not personally like Jok from something that happened on a int. team in 2014 when they were briefly teammates? I mean I just thought he hated Jok in a competitive way. 

What the hell happened?",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Will fucking Barton my goodness what a block,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
the nuggets own us and i hate it,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Timely block by Jokic,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Sorry TWolves. Y’all knew the deal when you decided to win the play-in game.,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Jokic was coming off of some knee soreness on the 2nd night of a back to back and dropped 26pts, 19reb, 7a, and 3 blocks. Dudes been absolutely a monster on both sides of the ball lmao.",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"that ending was kinda oof, edwards got confused with the buzzer sound even tho he was wide open",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves

"If you would have told me before the season that our half court offense would be our biggest issue, I wouldn't have believed you.",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Got the win and only had to play Barton 30 minutes.

Getting 17 minutes (and 3 assists!) out of Bones is gonna be huge if it helps us get Barton to the postseason healthy.",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Why is KAT shooting less than Edwards, Beasley, and DLo?",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
That was a hell of a block by Barton,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Twolves got a squad sheesh. Once Ant gets that jump shot going he's going to be a real problem 

Also I miss Beasley right about now",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"This game is so easy for Jokic now. Underrated on defense. He shut down KAT on 2-3 straight possessions in 4th. Always plays smart team defense, not a liability like national media makes it",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Wolves definitly much improved under finch. gg,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Really good defense by Timberwolves all game tbh. Can't be mad at the results when we were getting really good looks all game - just not converting 

I think in KAT’s head, he's still better than Jokic. He's not, and he probably should realize that today. Jokic is just a way smarter player.",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Edwards almost pulled a Matt Barnes and shoot from half court,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Jokic was masterful and dragged this team to a win. It’s crazy that people say he isn’t a top 5 player,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Jokic is still the best player on the court,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
timberwolves forgot how to play offense at the end lol,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"What a wild ending to this game, clutch block by Barton! 
Jokic contest too - guess Ant wasn't ready for it. Dang he was bleeding again.

Feels like something is off with KAT. He's slow but still presses way too hard going against Jokic too",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
TWOlves announcers bragging how Wolves where shutting Jokic down. He ends up with 26 pts 19 rebounds and 7 assists....not. Towns ended up with 14 pts 8 rebounds. Nobody shuts down the joker,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Jokic is making a case to be the best player in the leauge, he honestly might reach there",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Well. I liked nothing about that but the defense was good and malik played great,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
honestly you can’t even blame Edwards. the buzzer shouldn’t have sounded off but he’s definitely kicking himself rn,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves

Oh well on to next.",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Our defense still has over 10 blocks and steals tonight, but scoring was seriously missing.",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Insane ending lol,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
"It’s crazy, these teams were rivals (Minny with the upper hand) in 2018, and since then Denver has just absolutely lapped them. They’ll be a playoff team this year but man, the gap between Jokic and KAT got big and so did the gap between the teams. 12 straight wins for Denver",qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
That hurt my soul.,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
It hurts to be a fan of this team,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves

Fucking ew,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Really great game. Buzzer fucked with ant or he drives hard and wins it or gets fouled. Good ugly win by the nuggets. Wolves couldn't hit an open 3 to save their lives,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
How were the Wolves supposed to win with a one-armed KAT? Wolves fans told me Jokic dismembered him Olynyk style.,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
Will! Barton!,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves
And this is the start of Wolves fall. 11th place here they come.,qjgwk9,Denver Nuggets,Minnesota Timberwolves

"GGs Suns.... HOWEVER, Why is Mr JB playing Denzel with 5 mins left down 14? Seemed competitive still while ""Denzel""  and ""competitive"" are quite antonymous. He ""attempted"" a 30 foot 3 (lolz), bricked a jumper and had 3 fouls. Not sure if our starters were getting rest or whatever but I'd like more minutes from Windler regardless.

I'm surprised the Mavs are 4-2. The way Mavs fans have been acting on this sub I thought they must have been 1-4 or something.,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
Both teams shot like garbage from 3.,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
French Prince 🙏 I believe,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
Where were you when Frank led the Mavs bench in scoring?,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
Frank better continue getting regular minutes,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
Shooting 7-36 from 3 is the reason we lost this game. Can we please get an average game from Fox?,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
Man the dude they picked over Luka has really been benched,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
I now know what the purpose of this franchise is… to make former Knicks castoffs into quality basketball players. Kevin Knox 45% from 3 on this team next season is coming.,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings

">Here's your Dallas Mavs Post Game Summary. Now in our 6th Season. 6️⃣

Did the Mavs win? ✅ Our sub would've imploded even further had we choked that 

Oddly enough our starting 5 each had a 3 in the first 4 minutes of the game. 3️⃣💦

Luka started much better this game compared to last game with some bounces going the right way unlike Friday night. Finished with 23/8/10 going relatively quiet in the 2nd half outside of that heaves 3 👍🇸🇮

Timmy also played better than last game with 16pts off of 4 3's 👌💦

KP missed his 3rd game now with lower back tightness. Hopefully he's gonna be back soon with Maxi now injured. 🤞🏥🦄🇱🇻

Dwight with a solid 12/8 despite what our sub thinks. 👍
 
Maxi with 7/5 going a perfect 3/3 from the field before having to exit due to injury only playing 7min. Get well soon! 🇩🇪🏥💯

Doe Doe with 13/6 with 2 Steals and one emphatic dunk in transition 👍

Bench Analysis 💺⤵️

Frank was huge for us today both leading the bench in scoring and playing some pivotal defense to keep us in this. 12/3/2 while also going 2/2 from 3 💺🛡️👌🇫🇷

Brunson & Bullock both had rough shooting nights with near identical stat lines combining for 15/5/5 💺🧱 

Glad we got the win improving our record on Halloween to 9-3. Next game is Tuesday against the Heat on ESPN 🎃🔥📺",qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings

I SPEAK FOR ALL MAVS FANS THANK YOU KNICKS FOR THE FRENCH PRINCE,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
What a brickfest,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
"Just one of those days.  We aren’t going to win the game shooting something like 4% from 3 halfway through the fourth quarter.  I felt like we were doing ok in the 1st half by attacking the paint but alas, the inevitable outcoaching adjustment by the opponent happens at half and the interior scoring went away.  Buddy tries to bring us back but he always does his best to counteract his good by chucking trash shots.  If this guy had even average BBIQ and knew to not dribble, not pass, and only shoot when the opportunity presented itself, he’d be an absolutely devastating offensive weapon.  Instead it’s good Buddy/bad Buddy all game to the point that he’s basically neutral.  He even managed to squeeze in one of his patented late fourth quarter soft pass turnovers.

What’s up with Fox, man.  It’s just not there.  I mean, you can’t be this bad after getting paid.  Small sample size be damned, he has been horrendous.  Haliburton looks bad too.  Like he has no confidence.  Davion is the real deal though man. Dude is bloodthirsty out there.

Final dead horse beating observation:  everyone in the game thread point out all of Luka’s crying – but I would rather have him crying on our side while draining 35 foot dagger threes than have that other guy who is never playing for… reasons?",qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings

Marvin Bagley is never going to play again lol,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
"Fox putting on weight is the worst thing to ever happen. Not once has he played as good as he did last year, his fat ass can’t even attack the rim anymore, he gassed out so damn quick, is fat ass can’t let him jump when shooting a jumper or going for lay, and he went from an average defender to below average. He fucked it all up, if he played like how he did last year we easily going 6-0. It’s like the Kings are trying to carry him rn",qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
The Mavs are 4-2.  They way r/nba talks about J Kidd’s coaching you would think they were 0-6,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings

"Hey Kings fans, I've been a kings watcher and fringe supporter for the last 3 years or so, they're one of my most watched league pass teams due to when they play, loving the broadcast team last couple seasons and ofc De'Aaron. Loved Bogi and Hield splashing, Barnes clutch factor etc.

Anyway, I haven't watched much at all of y'all this season, other than the 4th quarter when Barnes won with the dagger. 

What's going on? Why are Fox's points down so much? Has Tyrese taken a leap in any facet? What's the fan bases long term hopeful plan with Hield/Barnes/Bagley?",qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
We keep winning so ugly. Seems like the whole team has forgotten how to shoot the ball. Like Luka is bacially just scoring by layups. Can't make a jumpshot to save his life.,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
Anyone else want to see Simmons for Fox? I think that's a pretty fair trade and could benefit both teams.,qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings

"Being a Kings fan aside, watching Luka play is unpleasant he just cries all game.",qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings
"For a team that's going to have such a challenging season as the Mavs, this is what they absolutely need to do. Win as many winnable games as they can, because they are going to lose a lot of the hard ones. That's still not good enough to make the playoffs, but getting in thru the play in because of Luka and being a 1sr round exit for the third straight year should still be a success. The team is just bad and they've constantly overachieved because of Luka and Carlisle. Now they have a downgrade at coach and they roster hasn't gotten any better. My take is Kidd won't last longer than this season and Luka stays maybe next year too and then will ask for a trade.",qjzka9,Dallas Mavericks,Sacramento Kings

"I just don't get how the whole summer is about how the team isn't good enough about how Dame demands better and needs the team to step up and then he plays like this.

It's not even a shooting slump. His passing was horrific the second half. His shot selection terrible. And on defense he looks like he doesn't give a shit.

Meanwhile CJ stepped up, Anfernee stepped up, Little is looking like a solid player, Nurk is looking improved, new coach and Lillard is just standing there with his arms out wide on defense while guards blow past him for easy layups.

Fucking pathetic Dame and it's literally costing us wins.",qk36ec,Charlotte Hornets,Portland Trail Blazers
Bridges is a fucking hoss.,qk36ec,Charlotte Hornets,Portland Trail Blazers

"One of the more frustrating game I've ever watched. We were getting better looks than the Hornets all night (up until we got frustrated that nothing was falling in the final few minutes) but just couldn't capitalize. Meanwhile Oubre out here hitting 3s with a man is his grill.

"Honestly, I had more takeaways about how talented this Bucks team is, playing hard with all those starters out. They really crashed the offensive glass in the first half and played tough defensively. Giannis is awesome to watch every time. Grayson has really become a deadly shooter. 

On the Jazz side, I thought both bigs played tough defense, and Royce did a good job making things difficult for Giannis. Nice to see Donovan really get aggressive. Clarkson didn't shoot it well, but he played hard and made some great plays. Once the shooting comes around I think the Jazz will look really good!",qk3eqp,Utah Jazz,Milwaukee Bucks

Honestly I expected us to lose this game by like 20+ points but I liked our fight. We just need to get healthy and we'll look like the Milwaukee Bucks and not the Giannikee Bucks,qk3eqp,Utah Jazz,Milwaukee Bucks
"We should be resting Giannis on games where we are missing 35% of our salary cap and on a b2b we had a very deep run focus should be on recovery getting in as a 4 or 5 seed is fine.

"Melo is 11th in the league in 3 pointers made lol he's shooting 50% from 3  
  
Lebron is 6th

I'm pretty sure Melo is leading the league in scoring off the bench not counting Herro who is getting starter minutes",qk6rma,Los Angeles Lakers,Houston Rockets
"My observations for Jalen Green:


It's not the missing shots that worries me. It's that he can't even take advantage when Reaves was guarding him one on one. He is also surprisingly limited offensively. It's either difficult step back 3s, or running full speed inside and throw himself in the air hoping to get a call. He needs to learn to use rymthm, sometimes slow down, not just run on one gear. Also that dribble is suspect and needs a lot of work. Shot form needs work too. Don't even get me started on his defense. He gets bullied by everyone, and he got out run by lebron and Westbrook in a chasedown? At least try to foul them instead of letting him dunk on you.



On scouting report he had a 9 for NBA ready score, (mobley had 8) but he is no where close to that. There's some false advertising there for his NBA readiness",qk6rma,Los Angeles Lakers,Houston Rockets

Evan Mobley,qkta39,Cleveland Cavaliers,Charlotte Hornets
"This Cavs team is so frustrating to watch. We keep dominating to start games and then spend the next 40 minutes shitting the bed. At least in this game we learned to intermittently stop shitting the bed so that we win. That said, as a Cavs fan, only 40 minutes of shitting the bed is incredibly refreshing.

Also, as a side note:

How do you generate post-game threads? I always come here right after Cavs games and I watch most of the Cavs games, so if I can I'd be happy to get these up a little faster. I think there'd be a lot more discussion if we got these sooner after the games end.",qkta39,Cleveland Cavaliers,Charlotte Hornets

"I never ever want to play the Hornets. They just **never** go away. 

If it's not LaMelo it's Scary Terry. If you manage to get them both off the court you've got Gordon Hayward, Kelly Oubre and Miles Bridges stretching the floor.

Sheesh.

Finishing the road trip from hell 3-2 is nothing short of amazing. I'm not going to get ahead of myself and proclaim the Cavs to be a ""good"" team but I don't think finishing close to .500 is out of the realm of possibility. 

GG Hornets",qkta39,Cleveland Cavaliers,Charlotte Hornets
Hornets tried really hard and scored like 4 3s in a row late in the 4th but Cavs managed to hold on. Very good win for a positive and hard road trip. Cavs need to improve 3pt shooting to reach next level.,qkta39,Cleveland Cavaliers,Charlotte Hornets

Like sure the game flow is better but as an observer it’s incredibly frustrating to see obvious contact on drive after drive that doesn’t get called.

He finally shortened the rotation and played the starters more.  Our starting 5 is legit for the most part.,qkuaew,Orlando Magic,Minnesota Timberwolves

If you wanna give up 6 games in idk why you're a wolves fan. But that really hurt,qkuaew,Orlando Magic,Minnesota Timberwolves
"3 things I took away from this game.

1. The Wolves offense is a self-inflicted mess. They force a ton of bad shots early in the shot clock for no real reason, it also usually comes when they have the momentum, which is why the Wolves have had so much trouble closing out teams. As much as I love Ant, he’s been one of the biggest perpetrators of this. I know that he can explode at any minute, but he needs to recognize that we don’t need him to go nuclear all the time, in games where we have the lead there’s no real reason to force an off the dribble 3 5 seconds into the shot clock. Finch needs to get ahold on this because Ant isn’t the only one and it has plagued us throughout the start of this season.

2. In a game where Jordan McLaughlin was absolutely cooked and highlighted just how much we need Pat Bev and Dlo, Taurean Prince was still by far the worst player on the court. His shot isn’t falling, his defense is exposed by any player who has a semblance of athleticism, and the amount of miscommunications he has with a teammate that leads to a turnover is startlingly high for this early in the season. The +/- stats in this game now are a bit skewed because of the Magic’s late 4th quarter surge but when this game was close in the 3rd he was like a -15 or something.

3. The Wolves will probably be alright, they missed a ton of open looks tonight (and this season) that will start falling eventually, but for a team that is a fringe playoff contender losses like these will come back to hurt you later on in the season. Credit to the magic who played great (especially Cole and Franz) but Wolves were up 13 in the middle of the third quarter and should’ve won this game. Finch needs to get a hold of this team because this is multiple games now where we’ve thrown away a lead due to sloppy and erratic play.",qkuaew,Orlando Magic,Minnesota Timberwolves

KAT has completely forgotten how to post up.

No one on our team can rebound to save their life.   Even when in position they tap the ball like a volleyball.

Everyone on our team is streaky.   Malik beasly might be our most consistent player on offense.

The ballhandling has been horrendous.    

We can't use our athleticism because we have no bigs to clear up space in the paint.

We commit way too many stupid fouls.",qkuaew,Orlando Magic,Minnesota Timberwolves

"Just want to preface this isn't hate on KAT but I feel like I never get to see the hype, like from what I've seen off the court and from what people say KAT seems cool and I like him but I feel like I never see him play good. Like apparently he was 23/24 from the line coming into this game and then while I'm watching he misses his first 4 free throws. It's just shit like that where he does all the awesome stuff while I'm not watching

Edit: I'm not saying KAT isn't good, I'm saying I'm sad I don't get to see him be good. Though as person below me pointed out he had a good game tonight so it's probably a me problem where I only see the bad for some reason",qkuaew,Orlando Magic,Minnesota Timberwolves

Shai put on a fantastic display of shotmaking in the 3rd and Giddey completely controlled the 4th quarter for us. Hit several self-created shots (including a mid range pullup over PG and a take to the basket on PG). He's so poised and mature for a 19 year old.

Our rotations are on point. Bam has been a monster as a help defender as usual and Dedmon’s been our go-to weapon if we’re trying to play drop coverage.

I feel like the only reason we built him up at the beginning of the year was for smoke and mirrors trade bait. 

Heat used a great double team strategy on Luka because the rest of the team is having a hard time getting good shots to go in.

"Man if the Heat play the Bulls in the playoffs we all win. And that's not even counting the Nets and Bucks. There's good odds that some variation of those matchups happen, and then the ECF is some other variation of those teams. Eastern playoffs are going to be amazing to watch this year. And then if Philly can find a way to make Joel Embiid last through the whole season we get to watch him play one of these teams too. Eastern playoffs are gonna be something special this year, because I think realistically all series in the 2nd round and the ECF can go to 7.

Against a better team, we never make this comeback. Hell, against this same team, we don't make this comeback if they have their two best players back. 

I'm happy for the win though. We needed it, ugly or not. And give Frank the goddamn game ball. He was the only one out there trying to get something going in the first half and he played his ass off.

"This is one of those games that stats don't show everything. Lakers look a lot better on paper than what they executed on the floor--poor boxing out, miscommunications on defensive duties, allowing the Rockets to get to the restricted area way easier than they should have, Lebron with the usual no effort for 3+ quarters, etc. Lakers had 60+ FG% in the first half and were still down 6 because of their atrocious defense. It's why the scoreline is a lot closer than it should have been.

AD was basically chilling/ball watching at the three point line for most of the second half on offensive possessions--only took 5 total shots in the paint in the 3rd and 4th quarter. He looked like he didn't want to bang in the paint and hardly tried to contest/jump for any 50/50 balls because he was scared he was gonna get injured.

Westbrook had some ill-advised prayer drives to the basket in the 4th (0-4 attempts I believe with a few bail-out FT trips) because his teammates were just ball-watching. You can't play efficiently or try to play point when your teammates aren't doing jack shit.",qln6vl,Los Angeles Lakers,Houston Rockets
What is defense anyways,qln6vl,Los Angeles Lakers,Houston Rockets

I’m gonna wait at east another 10 games before I make any proclamations but we look pretty good this year. Definitely much improved from last year and the passing has been much better in the first three quarters. We seem to get away from what we did to build big leads in the fourth tho. Gotta keep moving the ball in the fourth instead of going iso every possession late in the game. Still a good game and it feels good to actually see improvement from everyone this year. Don’t want to get my hopes up too much tho cuz the cavs had a decent start last year and we all know how that ended up. But so far so good.,qm9f3h,Cleveland Cavaliers,Portland Trail Blazers
Rubios shot wasn't falling but it he played good team basketball and created shots for others. That's a good player right there,qm9f3h,Cleveland Cavaliers,Portland Trail Blazers
"Lillard and CJ combined for 47 in 46 shots, not good at all. Cavs have been great playing unselfish basketball.  Mobley probably wants to get more looks but he has to understand its all about winning the game not getting 20 or 30 points.",qm9f3h,Cleveland Cavaliers,Portland Trail Blazers
Something extremely underrated in this game: -Windler coming in and looking like a pure shooter and gaining confidence. You love to see it. Let's just hope his glass body can hold up for a few weeks this time.,qm9f3h,Cleveland Cavaliers,Portland Trail Blazers

"I know it's never just one play and we need to shoot better

"The season isn’t lost after a 2 game losing streak, but Randle is really concerning me with his lack of hustle and his terrible body  language. Last season he was priding himself on carrying himself well on the court (even mentioning how he was disappointed in his son mimicking his on-court behavior). But this year you can tell when the defense gets in his head. 

Him not hustling and getting back on defense is not okay. He was a big part of our offense last season, and seems like a lot of those iso-fadeaways aren’t falling this year. I’m not concerned too much, but he needs to get back into it. Either that, or Thibs needs to change our offensive focus. 

I put a lot on Randle because he’s supposed to be our leader on the court. You lead by example, and the example he’s setting is not one I’m liking and does not represent our team mentality.",qm9j00,Indiana Pacers,New York Knicks

"Actually kind of expected us to lose this one, Pacers are much better than their record. They looked great/played lights out tonight. Still, disappointing loss .

That said, I love that no matter how bad things look, RJ **never** loses his cool or stops hustling. He is indisputably the fulcrum of this team and it says a lot that he's the one I automatically look towards to stabilize us when we're falling apart. The kid's only 21 but already has the presence and mentality of a seasoned vet. He may not be the flashiest player or the most naturally talented, but he has **It**. I remain utterly convinced he's going to be something special and will irrationally stan him to the day I die.",qm9j00,Indiana Pacers,New York Knicks

"Man Demar been on a tear. Mean this with no disrespect, simply didn’t catch the game because the Grizz were on, but it looks like he still got to the line quite a bit. What’s he doing that some of the other superstars aren’t with all the rule changes etc?",qm9i9d,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls
"Zavine wasn't good enough in the 4th quarter, questionable playmaking, couldn't hit necessary buckets, but damn DeMar! He was mounting that comeback nicely, Bulls almost had it.

"How many so called Eastern conference contenders must we behead w/o Ben, Harris, or Green before the NBA world recognizes what it really is in Philly?",qm9i9d,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls
"If Ben comes back I don't see how they justify him playing point anymore. Shift him over to PF to play interior ball with Embiid and let Seth run the point. Ben is a great passer, but without a willingness to even dunk anymore he has to give the ball up in the half court.",qm9i9d,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls

Only thing I can come up with is ""embiid blocked him first then ran into him with his body"" I still feel like that is a foul though? Not trying to be salty, just want to understand it. Embiid hit him enough to change Demar's direction mid air.",qm9i9d,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls

"I just don’t know what Billy was thinking keeping Lavine out of the game until under 7 minutes left in the 4th. We don’t play again till Saturday.

Lavine was 11-19 for 27 pts entering the 4th. No Sixer could stay in front of him without help. Just put him in the game between the 8-10 min mark and let him cook.

"I thought KD's off ball movement was the best I've seen from him in this game, a lot of his shots were moving off of screens into a midrange because he gets doubled whenever he brings the ball up and can't get a shot off

That three at the end of the quarter was a great example",qma3ne,Brooklyn Nets,Atlanta Hawks
the nets defense is legit this year. 10th ranked defense and slowed down atlanta pretty well tonight.,qma3ne,Brooklyn Nets,Atlanta Hawks
Don't let Trae's 21 and 10 fool you. He was terrible defensively(and offensively) even by his standards. He let Harris shoot open 3s all game. He was over helping and leaving Harris. He even had some sequence when he wasn't sure who he's guarding. Just terrible.,qma3ne,Brooklyn Nets,Atlanta Hawks
"DeAndre Hunter killing the Nets from 3 per usual. I think the Hawks should use a portion of the regular season helping him expand his offensive game even more. 

KD was KD. The team did a great job playing Trae in pick and roll. They’re coming together well. Hopefully they keep it going and Harden can continue coming back

Steven Adams being perfect from the free throw line after 8 games is not something I thought I’d hear,qmalr9,Denver Nuggets,Memphis Grizzlies
Jaren with 5 3s and 3 blocks!! That's what we need. BLOCKboy J3 😤,qmalr9,Denver Nuggets,Memphis Grizzlies
"Great team game. I mentioned Jaren but shout-out to Kyle Anderson, Bane, Melton and Adams for playing well on both ends and making plays on offense. Zaire giving us good minutes too.

But don't get too excited or let it go to your head. No long winning streaks here, no sir. That's hubris, which this blue collar, hard working everyman team doesn't have. A few wins in a row, these guys, true to form, will balance it out with a couple a losses. Yes sir, that's my 2021 Grizzlies.

Was that JJJ's best game of his career?,qmalr9,Denver Nuggets,Memphis Grizzlies
Every score by the Grizzlies down the stretch was with Jokic dropping on the screen btw,qmalr9,Denver Nuggets,Memphis Grizzlies
"I am not getting enjoyment out of this season.

Nuggets = great reputation for 3pt shooting Vs Memphis who don't have a reputation for 3pt shooting.

Lose a 2 point game because Memphis hit double the 3s, JJJ who comes into this game with an average of 30% from 3 and a PER below 10 goes off. Basketball is fucking stupid.",qmalr9,Denver Nuggets,Memphis Grizzlies

Edward with the 28pts and 6asts to go along with 3stls was nice but man the Clips couldn't miss.,qmakvj,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves

Wolves fans: Hello below .500 my old friend,qmakvj,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves

The tank rolls on",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"Got tight at the end but we pulled it out! Jalen is insane and the reason we won.

If he keeps playing at this level it could be a really good year",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Spurs have their broadcast team on camera almost as much as their players,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Brunson is literally forcing himself into the starting lineup.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Watch Cuban not pay Brunson and give Powell like 100m or something.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Brunson is so good,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
This might be the big one... im coming to see ya Elizabeth,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
This Spurs team plays some dumb basketball. What's the point of having McDermott in the game when he only has 2 shots and no plays run for him? Then just watched him getting cooked on D lol.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Brunson > Tingus Pingus,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
I started this season at 27 years old and I'm going to die of cardiac arrest by the ASB fr,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs

Trade No J Mayo and build a contender around Brunson,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs

Basketball sucks.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
The tanking continues for Chet/Banchero.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
I know I'm not the first person to ever bring this up but I really wish the NBA would develop a rule to eliminate that foul Ntilikina did to Dejounte at the end of the game. No fan wants to see which team can make more free throws at the end of the game. I would much rather see if the Spurs can hit a three and send it to overtime on a much more exciting play. also off topic but bobans giant ass won them the game,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
ITS THE JALEN BRUNSON ERA,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"Both coaches tried to give this game away down the stretch. Only one can succeed.  Mavs were hunting McDermott from the 6 minute mark til the free throws started, and Pop refused to adjust anything. Then Kidd telling Brunson to miss when up by 1.  

Lucky for him, SA has nobody that can execute in the clutch.",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
We almost threw that one away,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Jalen Brunson is a nasty man.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
This has been rough season. I like that we’ve kept the games close but damn.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"Wow 😯, that was a close one! Good game 👏",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Man Vassell didn't get a shot in the 2nd half of the 4th I swear.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Mavericks (3rd seed) have been outscored by 42 points this year. Spurs (12th seed) have been outscored by 4,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"Finally they unleashed Boban 17 points in 15 minutes 8 rebs +17 with 8-10 shooting .  Should have played more we know he has stamina for it . 

They have a great C on the bench they are not using thats a big waste of Mavs. Boban was also one of the better players vs Clippers in last playoffs series but didn't play as much as he should. At least he got his revenge on Spurs :D",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Luka straight chucking this season,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
I’m beginning to suspect that Pop is a better coach than Jason Kidd.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Sheesh Mavs got lucky at the end,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"League over. Boban was holding back before to give everyone else a fair chance, he's the greatest basketball player ever.",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"I get the impression that this Mavs team is succeeding early on despite Kidd, not thanks to him.",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"jason kidd literally trying to give that game away at the end. holy shit.

brunson a bad man. he also just said “i was told to miss the second free throw, don’t hold it against me” translated “my coach made a stupid fucking decision and because he’s the coach, i have to follow it”",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Mavs are in trouble if this is the scoring effort.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
I swear Jason Kidd needs to be fired,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
I am really curious at how bad we will lose to the Celtics on Saturday. We look so fucking bad. Lost to every good team by 10+.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
We were 1 spurs score away from another Jason Kidd classic,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Luka garbo this game,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"This team is legit 10-12 points worse off per game with Kidd as coach and genuinely don’t think that will improve anytime soon

Lucky to be 5-3 given the super soft schedule",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"One of these days, we’ll close out a game and not have random people having the game of their lives against us",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
 The intentional missed free throw is something else huh? 😂😂,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Spurs have the worst FO in the nba,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
That ending...,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs

mavs -2 shoot me in the face.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT DEVIN VASSELL?

We were thinking of drafting him before Obi fell to us and I was always curious how he’d pan. Seems to be doing dandy. Spurs fans what’s he been doing to rise so dramatically from his first season?",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Boban with the +17 to cancel out Luka's -17.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"I'm really excited about Jalen as a prospect. All indications is we have a starter caliber guard as a backup for when Luka's off the field. Give us a better center to pair with Boban and we have a solid core for the next couple years.

All we need is KP off the god awful contract he's on, and some better shooters",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
The fuck happened to Luka. Dont really watch mavs games but that was a shit show.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
KP should give Jalen half his contract. It’s only fair.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Is it just me or is every team just shooting like crap from three this season?,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs

I almost had a heart attack when I saw Kidd asking JB to miss the free throw,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
If that game didn't prove Jason Kidd is a dogshit coach...,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"Jesus Christ, Luka taking almost 40 shots a game now (37). Thats way too many for that return. Kidd needs to address the way Dallas is playing offense right now.",qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
How is luka so bad at shooting 3s now ?,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
bro wtf was that end of game?,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
What was that inbounds man,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs

Anyone have a clip of that Eubanks block on THJ?  Yeesh.,qmbf6j,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"Jesus Christ the warriors are deep. They have so many options to throw at you until they can find something that works and just take over. And with so many solid bench players they can out last and tire out teams that are hot. On top of all of this, they still have Klay and Wiseman coming back later in the season and that’s just gonna make them even DEEPER.",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
There ain't no party like a Poole party.,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
It feels weird to not lose when Steph isn’t playing well. Huh…,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
I legit get jealous watching the warriors Bc the way they play offensively is so much more watchable and entertaining than my team,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
My one take from watching this game is that the Warriors became infinitely better the moment Kelly Oubre was no longer part of the team.,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Damn our bench is scary good wtf happened,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"The Mitten? More like THE GAUNTLET! Every time GP2 steps in, we turn it up ESPECIALLY on defense!",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

WWWWLWWarriors,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"it seems like it might not be a good idea to go small against the Warriors.

Charlotte going small enabled the Warriors to put Steph & Poole together while still having a great guard stopper in GPII, a great wing defender in Wiggins, and Draymond all on the court. That's a *lot* of active defense and two very good scoring guards.",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"Gary Payton is Gary Payton II's daddy, and Gary Payton II is my daddy.",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

Give GP2 his guaranteed contract now,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"Poole/Lee/GP2/Bjelica/OPJ.

Jesus fucking christ, the Warriors FO are a bunch of crackheads finding these guys.

GP2 is an insane defender. Had a 1 minute stretch of O rebound, putback, steal and block. No wonder the entire FO loves him.

Just bring back 'Strength in Numbers' at this point.

Edit:just to point out, first few games, it was Bjelica/OPJ doing well off the bench, now we got GP2/Poole (ik he starts but still). Warriors got insane depth who any one can pop off at a time.

Edit 2: they touched on this on the broadcast but def see Curry's influence in Poole. From off-ball movements to directing traffic.

Sidenote, ESPN had a really nice NBA 75 transition on their scoreboard with the team logos transition from old to new.",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"I am 100% convinced that GP2 is the mastermind of the Walgreens shoplifting ring, he's an absolute thief out there holy hell",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

ngl, I think warriors may end the season as the best defense in the league somehow - so many great defensive players in there",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

Awesome win.",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"This might be my favorite game of the season so far. GP2 definitely won the hearts of the Bay. And honestly, It was pretty loud tonight.",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

It's hard not to see them as a top 4 seed in the West",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

POOOOLEEEE SZN 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Bridges looked amazing,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
I’m so torn I love the Mitten but I don’t like how he massacred my boys tonight. Fuck! These emotions!,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
I think poole is a good player,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
u/JordanPoole-Goat come get ur mans,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
The your mittens and swim suits cause the Poole party is in winter,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
ESPN: Are Mittens better than Gloves?,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"GP2 was so good this game. He's got some fucking hops! That alley / put back was dope, not to mention the poster on Kelly Oubre",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
I like gpll. those poke outs on the crossover really reminded me of his dad.,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
GP2 is so good defensively. He reminds me of an elite cornerback in the NFL where you can’t even throw the ball on his side of the court or he’ll take it,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
My bet for Warriors winning the west looking great so far,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Lol kelly Oubre tonight,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
kelly oubre doing his thing,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
It's nice to see Draymond happy again.,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
🐐shit from Poole,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
If Klay is somewhat near to what he was before we might see a 2015 Warriors again,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
The mitten showed up big enough. (As did splash pool.),qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"I feel like an old man yelling at clouds, but boy I hate teams wearing white in away games",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Is Jordan Poole better than LaMelo Ball?,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
POOLE PARTY!!!,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Worst job Mark Jones has ever done calling a game. Talked without thinking the entire time.,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Where's the kings thread I wanna talk dhit,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
scary hours,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
The Mitten is a menace!,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"Gp3 MVP.

It rhymes because it feels good",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"If GP II can contribute offensively like he did tonight, he’s a lock for more playtime. His defense is too good to ignore.",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Poole party,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Hornets played well for stretches and Bridges went off. Curry wasn't very aggressive tonight and played a weird rotation.,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"Curry had an off shooting game, but at this point he has no wasted movement on offense",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"Steph Curry with the only negative +/- for the warriors, trade him to the Raptors because he's obviously washed ;)",qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Curry was 6-15 and they won by 20. Team is legit. Warriors Heat finals?,qmcqqj,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Looks like Fox is starting to get his rhythm back,qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
Best 1-8 team ever.,qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
When Nickel Alexander Walker is your first option 👍,qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
"[Once more, with feeling.](https://streamable.com/eqznq2)",qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
"Crazy fact: Last season, the Pelicans had a positive net rating with Zion on the court 

This team without him is god awful lol",qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
It was close until it wasn’t. Kings brought the intensity in the fourth quarter and we were no match for them. With our schedule coming up I only see OKC as a winnable game. We could very well start the season 3-17 or 4-16.,qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
"i’ma be honest, with how JV plays, Zion would quite literally have destroyed us if he was healthy rn",qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
"Kings Big 3 point guards had a 20:1 Assist/TO ratio. That, r/nba is why you pick the best player available and not Marvin Bagley.",qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
"this game felt like last year's Kings on defense. we won because the Pels didn't have their best guys, and because we blew up in the fourth quarter for once. Fox and Haliburton both looked good at the same time for the first time all year.

kinda scared to say it but I might like Alex Len?",qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
graham takes 2 shots in the 2nd half with half the team out?,qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans

"Man tbh I feel bad for Pelicans fans. How do you go from BI, Lonzo, Zion, and others to being 1-8…",qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
Pelicans really trying to get another 1st round pick next year,qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
Am I the problem?,qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
"So Chet, Banchero, or Hardy with Zion+Ingram?",qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
Is Bagley hurt?,qmcv0h,Sacramento Kings,New Orleans Pelicans
"Seth curry is scorching the nets, holy shit.",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"Embiid with -9 and Drummond with +20.  LOL

""Starters"" were struggling besides Curry.  But the second unit and the end of the bench sure did pick it up.

B2B and missing Tobi, Danny, Isaiah, Furk...",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Sixers should be 8 and 1 if not for an epic collapse against the nets,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"Cunningham had 2pts in his first game, 6pts last game, and now 18pts tonight. He's tripling his offensive output every game. Next game, he'll have 54pts, then 162pts and that'll be some kind of record.",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Fucking Sixers man lmao. 2/5 starters no problem. What a weird team,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Curry has to be contender for most improved player of the year. He is doing the jump of role player to star player.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"Hot take: Seth is an all star caliber player who just doesn’t get the same opportunity/support as guys like Trae, Mitchell, Book, etc.",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Imagine if Ben Simmons gets traded for a relatively good haul,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"I know Maxey's got young legs and all, but almost 45 minutes?  Doesn't that sound like a lot?  It sounds like a lot.",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Our team kinds looked like a team in that first half Holy shit this is gonna be a good year,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
I was told we were wasting Embiids prime and he was going to leave rather than be apart of such a bad team…,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Benjamin Simmons driving around downtown in shambles,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"generic amicable comment stating that my satisfaction that the sixers won but also one that compliments the pistons and their fanbase for a good, respectful game",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons

"Hot take:  

Tyrese Maxey is a better fit for the Sixers than Ben Simmons.",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
We are deep this year.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Look at Curry man…,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
This legit may the best Sixers bench unit of my life time. I literally cannot think of another time where our bench was not only able to maintain but also extend leads.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Meet your new (tentative) #1 seed.  Same as the old one.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
I can't believe I'm saying this but Drummond is actually good. And by good I mean he's contributing to winning basketball. It felt like the team was playing better with him on the floor than Joel even. Never thought I'd say this about him.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
If seth is gonna keep playing like an offensive star we're contenders. But if Jo is gonna keep playing like an offensive roleplayer then we're not contenders again.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Seth Curry-Josh Richardson trade looking worse & worse by the game,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
About to move into 1st in the East.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"Wow, Ben Simmons is playing great so far this year",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Tyrese Maxey,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons

So like another Boban i guess",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Franchise cornerstone Seth Curry,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Who knew Drummond would be +20 and embiid -9,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
PLAY THE DAMN SONG! AHHHHHHHHHHH,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Cade is gonna end up being a special player. Figure all star,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Ben Simmons says excuse me when he farts alone,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"Sixers are good.

Detroit is bad.

Embiid looked pretty gassed on the 2nd half of a b2b.

Cade Cunningham has the greenest green light I've ever seen.",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
God the Mavs FO fucked up so hard,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"You mean, The Better Curry",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Dallas trading Seth Curry for Josh Richardson might lowkey be one of the worst trades of the decade,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
“Detroit just kind of forgot about Joel Embiid on that last dunk.” - D&D,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
So the Mavs really trade an other guard who is a a beast at 3pt ? A 30 yo guard thinking they saw his peak ? S. Curry is the best player on the best team in the league. Curry for MVP.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
They won without Turkish Delight? Damn maybe the 76ers are the real deal!,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"Real talk... Are the sixers just straight up better without Ben at all? Giving Ben's minutes to Seth, Maxey, and Milton seems like its working better for them.",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
At least Cade Cunningham finally scored in double digits?,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
picking up Maxey for my fantasy team off waivers was a good decision,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Drummond with a game high +/- I guess he did things? (didn't watch),qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"If you were told that the Tigers would have 3x as many W’s as the Lions and Pistons combined…

The correct answer would be to buy a lot of booze for your buddy from Detroit.",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Lol what if Seth just goes and average 20ppg,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
What's wrong with Cade's shot? It was so money in college but now he can't hit anything.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"Cade shot 9/10ft and had a nice drive and 3.

His shots gonna start falling, had 2 3s that rimmed out and a bunch of shots that looked good but didnt go in. He'll be fine.",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Beef stew bodied joel in the first half very impressive by the kid,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"I thought Cade was a bust? 
How did he put up 18 pts 10 reb 4 ast?",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Would be sad to see Maxey gone in a package trade with ben but if it gets you a Lillard or Beal type of guard you do it 10/10 times,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"Pretty nice stat line from Cade, though seems like the refs bailed him out with freethrows",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Another 2 men down but it don’t matter,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Just don’t let Detroit have any sports team anymore,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Pistons are about as embarrassing as the Lions. Poor Cunningham is saddled with a bunch of 12th men as teammates.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
Cade with yet another stellar shooting performance. 4 out of 17 and 1 out of 7.,qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"Guys, I think the Pistons might not be as good as well thought.",qn04mt,Philadelphia 76ers,Detroit Pistons
"39 points in the first half, 77 in the second

I need some of whatever super soldier serum Jordan Clarkson took at halftime",qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"Clarkson pops off as soon as i take him off my fantasy team

👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍",qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"This team has looked like shit this season. The perimeter defense is gunning for worst in the league and we don't even score at all to make up for it. The little graphic that says ""team hasn't scored a field goal in X minutes and Y seconds"" at the bottom popped up every single quarter and was at least 2 mins long drought lol.",qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Jordan Clarkson. It's safe to say that he attends a lot of jazz basketball games,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Looks like Clarkson is used to the new basketballs now,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"Damn Utah games need more upvotes to get bumped up they are the best team in the west by far lol. 

Killing teams even if this was close till mid 4th was a double digit win on the road vs a playoff team.",qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks

Clarkson was +30 in 31 minutes,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
How tf did we win this one😭,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Hawks are a looooooooooong way away from opening night. They got big problems,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Jazz were one point away in the second half from doubling their first half points total,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
This is the most Jekyll and Hyde ass game I ever watched.,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Jazz doing a cover version of the Bulls terrifying 4th quarter from a few nights ago.,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Absolutely disgusting,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks

I didn't watch the game but how did Collins grab just 2 rebounds?,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"Good start to the season! I could still go more games where we are comfortably ahead at the end of the 3rd Quarter or so. Lots of close games so far, but I’ll take the wins.",qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Guess Nate McMillan isn't Red Auerbach afterall,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
What's wrong with Atlanta right now?,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"Man, whoever beat the Jazz must be really fucking good",qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"Without Donovan Mitchell, too. Their regular-season success and playoff disasters the last few years reminds me of the Bucks. In the next couple seasons, I'm betting they figure out how to translate the success to the post season like the Bucks did.",qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Boring games today,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Utah just number 1 seeding till they get bounced again in the playoffs haha,qn0imq,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks

Obviously. Hammercock Horford in the building.,qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat
Well that changes the power rankings,qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat

What the fuck is the Celtics team,qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat

"It was great to see the team play with different players besides Schroder, Tatum and Brown attempting most of the scoring. Tatum was very willing to pass the ball, which was fantastic and really threw the Heat off as they didn't know where to focus their defense. It's the right ingredients for a great team and hope they keep up the truly unselfish play. The bench players were able to play some in your face defense and contest, which was great.",qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat
Literally no reason to play JRich over Aaron and/or Romeo at this point. They’re both competent on D and can shoot. Nesmith plays harder than 99% of the league,qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat
Betting the NBA this year has been impossible.,qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat

Overall Murphys law came and decided to truly fucked us hard and sideways",qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat
Celtics offense wasn’t working this season so they just decided to play defense so hard that it won’t matter.,qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat
Looks like Boston's defense really smothered Miami tonight.,qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat
95-78?!? What is this 92’?,qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat

Miami is such a great defensive team. They held their opponents under 100 points!,qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat
Miami went full game 7 Rockets never go game 7 Rockets. They were shooting bricks and they decided that the only way to fix it was to shoot more bricks from three heck Jimmy joined in on the party with his 0-4.,qn0jyl,Boston Celtics,Miami Heat

Lakers offense is ASS, they can build leads but struggle to maintain them, too ISO heavy, they need to run more sets for ez buckets. 

AD is a walking mismatch whose way too goddamn passive, man should be forcing the issue more, make the defense adjust to you

Honestly though, I know Russ had an overall “good” stat line game, but I think we all know by this point that those can be marred by poor decision making down the stretch.

"Knicks are the first New york team of the season to beat the defending champions.


On the real though. Bucks are missing players it’s a matter of when not if they surge back into a top 4 seed in the East. Giannis is incredibly dominant and missing your starting Center against another Playoff level team will get you fucked in the paint. 

Despite that...the Knicks played incredibly well. They didn’t let their slow start throw them off and they kept their foot on the gas to close the game. That’s hard no matter who you are playing.",qnqa83,New York Knicks,Milwaukee Bucks
"Glad we won, but Bucks are my 2nd team and Giannis has been my favorite player for years (tied with RJ), so can't feel too great about it. I definitely do not want these teams to meet in the post-season. Not reading into this too much since the Bucks are depleted.

I need to point out Knicks were shooting 23% 3PT% at some point and never shot over 29%. We shot considerably fewer 3s during our huge swing in the 2nd half - not a coincidence in my view. I know we're an actual 3pt threat this year, but we try and force them too much IMO. We're actually really deadly in the paint/in the mid-range with a ton of offensive options - sometimes the old ways are best, we need to be more willing to drop the 3s when they're cold and go back to our 2pt game.",qnqa83,New York Knicks,Milwaukee Bucks

"Bucks rebounding was awful.  The defensive boards were a disaster, but the offensive boards were also funny, Bucks constantly booting offensive rebounds out of bounds and missing putbacks.

Bucks really missing Brook and Giannis played a bad defensive game and rebounding game, was not playing that hard this game.  He doesn't rebound hard like he used to when he was winning his MVPs.

Bucks have a lot of awful players in rotation right now, guys that suck on both ends.  And that contributed to their offense drying up totally, cause if Giannis wasn't gonna go balls to the wall, nobody was gonna be able to do anything.  Portis sucked today and Hill is always low impact, so they didn't offset Semi/Thanasis/Hood/Nwora not being good players./",qnqa83,New York Knicks,Milwaukee Bucks

You can really see how much the refs aren't calling fouls this year when you have a tough defensive team like the Knicks against a bunch of long defenders like the Bucks.

His FG% would've been closer to 70% tonight without the 3s but instead he takes them and ended up at 45%.

"Garland bailed the fuck out of Bickerstaff's absolutely asinine coaching.

How the fuck do you as a NBA coach, has a guy that shot 4 of 17 all night, turned the ball over every time he drives into a crowd, be the man to win you a game?  And how the fuck do you not call a TO when said guy just once again tried to iso 1 on 5 and almost turned the ball over again?

I thought Cavs fans were a bit overblown with Bickerstaff's bad coaching, but they are every bit right.  I pray Cleveland management won't get blinded by this winning and still keep his ass on the bench in the long run.",qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors

"really didn't think CLE would have the horses to win this without Lauri, Okoro, and Love.

really hard fought game by both teams, especially for the regular season.",qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors
lot of teams should do what the Raps did and purposely tank to get a top pick. they could have made the playoffs last year but they just decided not to. can you imagine if they actually traded Lowry earlier for good picks and Siakam is healthy. theyd be a lot more dangerous.,qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors
I did not watch the game and I feel bad not seeing two of the best teams in the east battling each other but I'm glad the team ruling east won. Also Mobley is gonna funk around and win ROY,qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors

cavs took their first lead with 4 seconds left lmao,qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors
Sexton really tried his best to sell the game in last 15 seconds my god Cavs were lucky to keep the ball,qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors
If blondie ever refs a raps game we either lose or win barely despite the reffing. She fuckin hates us lol,qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors

Jarrett Allen not having a single foul call against him and the Cavs still having one to give at the end is disgusting. They were getting away with murder.,qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors

"I honestly never say this but fuck those refs!

Credit to the Cavs at the same time! Yall got a squad! Id kill to have Jarrett Allen or Even Mobley if I could! 

I feel so annoyed though. Freds horrible shot to ice the game. The goaltend that wasnt called? 2 solid defensive possessions at the end of the game only for OG to trip him up and send him to the line. So many missed opportunities! 

And so many fuckin bad calls!",qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors
Barnes roty,qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors
Cavs congrats but I really needed you to be worse this season we’ve never made it to the second round 😅,qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors
Looks like the missed goaltending call was costly afterall,qnq3x6,Cleveland Cavaliers,Toronto Raptors

"KAT and Ant had the same number of field goals made, but one took twice as many shots.",qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
this game might end up being 1/4 of PG's free throws the whole season lmao,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
Maybe if Clippers start Mann instead of Bledsoe they wouldn't have to constantly fight back double digit leads.,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
This Clippers team looks pretty resilient.,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
KAT said something about it's easy to go from 3 straight losses to 20 straight losses. Looks like he could be right,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
[deleted],qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
"It pains me to say this but Ant's shot selection is really becoming a problem. Extremely reminiscent of his mid-winter slump last year. Between that and this fucking team's inability to get KAT shots, they're sunk. Ant needs to prioritize attacking the hoop and the offense needs to run through KAT. Finch needs to hammer Ant on better shot selection or this season is done and he's gonna turn into another Wiggins.",qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers

Wolves didn't help themselves by settling for so many 3s (51 attempts!), but getting just 5 free throws until garbage time was ridiculous.",qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers

Its embarrassing that Mann was making KATs life difficult in that fourth quarter. Reminds me of KP.,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
Crazy that they are down by 20 in the 1st half then win 20 points in the 2nd. This team like to play behind and will grind you out even on their worst shooting nights,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
Paul George is playing out of his mind this year,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
"Ant is so inefficient at this point in his career, why does he take so many shots every game?

Tbh that's on KAT for being too passive as well but people talk like Ant is already a great scorer when he's pretty much been a 20 points on 20 shots guy this season",qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
Ant shouldn’t have double the amount of shots against KAT considering Clippers’ interior defense,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
Ant shoots a lot of 3s,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
I just... I know our roster isn't amazing but we should be better than this.,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
The Timberwolves being hyped as a good team every offseason is like Ben Simmons shooting 3s during summer workouts. Not worth buying into. So in that way maybe Simmons and the T'Wolves are a good fit for each other after all.,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
Same team different year,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
"Missed most of this game because I had to go do something, when I left I honestly didn’t think we’d win, when I got back we were comfortably winning. From what I gathered it was a combination of a favourable whistle and the Wolves being the Wolves. So not a great W but I’ll take it. I did see that apparently Jaden McDaniels fouled out in 12 minutes of play time. I’m interested to know if they were mostly legit fouls or were they ticky tacky?",qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
hello darkness my old friend,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
Scored 27 points in the second HALF. Ain't gonna win many games with that.,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
"That second half performance from the Wolves was pathetic. That team looked so defeated after we went on a 7-0 run to make it 82-71~ 

That team lost the game in the 3rd quarter. With that attitude, playcalling, and lack of shotmaking they had no chance in the 4th",qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
"Towns 7-11 on FGA / 3-5 from 3

this kills the wolves",qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
"The 3 pillars of our franchise.

1. A center who literally gets bodied by anyone (can't even post up Reggie Jackson). Super passive, but likes to scream at the refs. Can't make a pass to save his life.

2. A SG who likes to chuck the ball and offers very little elsewhere.

3. Another SG who is pretending to play PG. Streaky guy who is best suited for a 6th man role.

I would say life sucks as a Wolves fan, but life has always sucked so this is the norm. On the other hand, Terrence Mann is amazing. He took Karl's balls tonight. Neutered KAT.",qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers

When is this sub going to take off their blinders to the fact that Edwards is another Marcus Smart who thinks he's good at shooting 3s and will chuck up 12 a game and miss most of them,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
Wolves are done. Cooked. Finished. Pack it up there's no coming back from this one,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers

KAT is so fucking soft I hope the next fan base that gets him realizes he’s a puzzy,qnqqil,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Clippers
"Terance Mann needs to get back in the gym and practice his shots more. 30 minutes on the floor, with only 13 points? Dude has a ton of potential and needs to keep progressing his game.

Barbosa, Speights, Clark, Iggy off the bench.  Now they have Poole, Bjelica, JTA, Porter.  Individually you wouldn't think too much about them.  But the more they play together the better they get.

We drafted four guys this year including trading 5 years of protections for Kai Jones (can't trade our first rounders until 2026 yay!) and none of them are even close to seeing playing time. The bench is a confusing mess and the starters start off every game by putting us in a 12 point hole. We handed Terry Rozier a fat extension that starts next year and he responds by putting up 20% FG shooting nights with shit defense.

It's just so funny that we forced out Cho (previous GM) for going all in on a core that just wasn't that good and then handed the keys to a guy who does the exact same thing but with a team that didn't even make the playoffs.

I’m guessing Jalen Green was benched the last 2mins because he’s a defensive liability,qobvze,Denver Nuggets,Houston Rockets
"Competitive most games and still losing is a win for the Rockets. I mean really this team isn’t going anywhere this year and can only make things worse by winning too many games. Develop some of these young guys, stay in these games without winning too many of them, get a great draft selection and build off of this year. They’re not getting blown out a lot and they’re playing hard and still losing. Best case scenario for them in my opinion",qobvze,Denver Nuggets,Houston Rockets

Hitting every shot, Herro going **nuclear**, getting a 20pt lead and the Jazz coming right back with some heavyweight punches of their own to claw their way back and have a shot to tie it at the end.

The heat give up a ton of open threes. I thought what happened in the 4th was going to happen in the 3rd but then was shocked for it to happen in the last 4 minutes of the game. This would be a super fun finals with d Wade and Whiteside on the other side.,qoeowy,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz

Jazz are still an elite team, happy to get a win here",qoeowy,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
"Of all the things about the NBA, probably my least favorite is how refs seem to take pity on smaller players and let them play by different rules. If Tyler Herro bear hugs Rudy Gobert on a roll, it should still be a foul despite Rudy being a foot taller.

That being said Rudy needs to do a better job of not letting no-calls affect him mentally. It’s been a recurring trend that a few bad calls and he gets frustrated and plays poorly. Not a great showing from him tonight.",qoeowy,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz

Alex Caruso with over 20 mins logged. oh shit,qof6x4,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls
"I say this while knowing that Vuc is a starter-level talent, but the man needs to not start for a few games. He's clearly in a slump and forcing him out there to not function is doing no one any good. Let him play against backup bigs until he gets his legs back under him. Bradley isn't the better player normally but right now he'll do less damage to the team's chances.",qof6x4,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls
Simmons who?,qof6x4,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls
Embiid is a bad man,qof6x4,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls
Really embarrassing loss for the Bulls.  They clearly aren’t ready to be in that upper tier of the East if they are going to lose to the sixers missing half their team twice,qof6x4,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls
"Sorry bulls you just ain’t on our level, morey needs an apology he’s one Ben Simmons Trade away from making us favorites",qof6x4,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls
So is it safe to say the early Bulls hype was premature? They just lost to us twice while we were missing multiple starters both times...,qof6x4,Philadelphia 76ers,Chicago Bulls
 Indescribable agony,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Luka magic is really fun when it's not happening to you,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics

KP was great,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics

This is good because Boston lost,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics

Pain.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
That was the dumbest foul ever,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"The KP putback off the Brunson miss and that dagger 3 was a filthy way to end the game. Gj Mavs, need the Cs to stay down while Brown is out lmfao.",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Not again…,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Can't believe we blew a 20 pt lead but the ending was worth it!,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Marcus Dumb,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Luka is just unbelievable. We're witnessing the first steps in the career of what will be one of the all time greats,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"KP stepped up in the 4th after being lackluster for most of the game offensively, 10 of his 21pts were in the final quarter. Also, defended well and got that clutch block (this was relatively consistent throughout the game though).",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
LUUKAAA CALLED GAMEE!!,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics

"My gf is concerned, I'm hard.",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
If the Mavs add a big man like Adams or Valanciunas they’re a top 3 team,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"Jason Kidd: 6-3

Rick Carlisle: 3-7",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"I don’t know a lot about basketball so I was really confused by that foul. Thought it must’ve been the “right” play since, ya know, the professional basketball player did it. 

Nope smart is just dumb",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Lukaaaaaaaaa!!!,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Smart just gave a dumb foul.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Why did Smart foul at 4 seconds left on the shot clock? We would have forced a shot and got the ball back with 10 seconds to tie/lead. Am I missing something?,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Why the fuck did smart basically give us the possession,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Imagine thinking that giving the last shot to Dallas is a good idea.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
What a wonderful day 😃,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Luka Dagger Doncic strikes again!,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Was that the coach's call to foul Luka or did Smart do that himself? I was shocked they did that lol.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
I can’t wait to listen to Scal on NBA radio tomorrow lmao,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
That rebound that hit Tatums foot really crushed the momentum!,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Damn this is the first win of the season that’s actually made me feel good,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Feels like Luka has been improving from the line this year. Good for him.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"Which is tastier, a Celtics loss or their announcers salt?",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"Luka was like ""what you're not doubling me?"" and he had something to teach Boston about that.",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
I'm just here to shit on the kings,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
he can’t keep getting away with it!,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"Smart giving the foul and letting Mavs have the last shot was dumb as fuck, and fits in with his play in the last couple of minutes - he should have given away other fouls the refs didn't call, and his attempt at drawing a foul was comedy gold",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
We're only 2 games behind the Celtics. Neat.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Marcus Smart is worth a $77M extension btw. Heart and soul of the team btw.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Trae doesn’t hit that shot,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"Why did the Celtics foul


-because it’s the Celtics",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"Shout out to Marcus Smart, a man who hasn't improved a single aspect of his game in 4 years but somehow has the self-assuredness to call out the development of the actual good players on the team in front of the media.  I wish all of us could feel this type of delusional confidence no matter how fucking dreadful we are at what we do.",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
I love when the Celtics implode,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
helps inevitable laker loss,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Those last few minutes were a mess. At least Luka gave us a cherry on top of that shit sundae,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Can someone please make a post about Luka's career averages against the Celtics? The man HATES us.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Defensive specialist Marcus Smart making the worse defensive play of the night.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Both teams were terrible at boxing out at the end.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Such a boneheaded foul by Marcus. Let Luka get right to his spot with time to spare instead of forcing him to go downhill and improvise a shot that still would have left time on the clock for the C’s. Disappointing. JT haters wya tho,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Let's gooooooo,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
This game don't count the C's are missing their FP Jaylen Brown,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"Luka with the game winner, best +/-, and perfect from the line. Maybe this will keep the haters at bay for now.",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
"WCS was somehow a +7 with 0 point,0 rebound and 0 assist 😳",qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Heat>Mavs>Celtics>Heat,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
Mavs absolutely crumble when defenses start getting more aggressive in the 4th.  They were lucky to come away with this one,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
LOLtics 😂 Celtics are the new Knicks,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
All that effort to comeback for nothing lmao,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
No.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics
6-3 but looked doo-doo every single minute is kinda impressive.,qofkyv,Dallas Mavericks,Boston Celtics

"...god damn it. Bogi, wtf was that lol",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
So I don't watch Hawks basketball but they sign Kevin Huerter to a $16 million/year contract and he puts up 6 points a game on 36% shooting? Is something up with him,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Feelin kinda Sunny bois, not gonna lie",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
That was literally the worst possession for a game winning shot I have ever seen,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Nader really isn't it. Suns should've used the rest of that mid-level on Torrey Craig.

Fun game to watch though. Good to see even with Ayton out they can hold their own. Hopefully the Suns continue to gel so they're ready to push for good seeding ASAP",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
The shot selection by the Hawks in the final minute were so questionable.,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Devin ""Foot on the Line"" Booker",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
How did we win this game lol,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
YOU JUST GOT FRANKED,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"interior defense and rebounding kinda ass without ayton, frank was great offensively though. team is still really struggling to shoot the three in general.

book was awesome tonight. cp3 continues to rack up the assists and knock down shots with needed, it feels like his role on this team has evolved from last year and he's really only looking to score when needed or the situation clearly calls for it. shamet also had a big contribution in that 4th when we were down.",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
CP3 is the man !,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"That one hurt. Right now we have adjustment problems from last year. There are too many mouths to feed and some guys are just feast or famine. It feels like a rhythm and rotation problem. 

I know its probably an overreaction because we have been playing some great teams, but it just doesn't seem like everyone is on the same page these past few games. I also suspect that the longer the season goes this weakness of too many bodies might becomes a strength.

Suns are going to be tough for anyone yet again this year. I also stream the games and want to say the Suns broadcast team was probably my favorite so far this year as well. That was a fun duel.",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Frank the tank sends his regards.,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Bogdanovic said no OT tonight.

This game had crazy energy and was a ton of fun to watch. Our defense sorely misses Ayton when he's out, but damn if Frank didn't make up for it with his offense.

GG Atlanta. Let's meet in the finals and have seven of these.",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Ik plus minus ain't mean much in 1 game, but Christ Paul in a 5 point W was +26....",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Devin Booker,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
I had to scroll disrespectfully low for this post game thread.,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Frank is better than people realize.,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
MFs really used to try and tell us Booker wasn’t a winning player,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"+26 in a 4 point win

GOAT",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
What was bogi thinking?????,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Absolutely disgusting, once again",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Booker is back,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
That felt like a playoff game insane game,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Back to back to back half point covers after missing the Cavs cover by half a point. Damn the oddsmakers are good at their jobs,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Fuckin hell that game was fun. I would take a 7 game series between these two teams next June…,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Great game in the last quarter! Just whipped my hawks ass. Gutted I hope the coaching staff and the players assess their decisions down the stretch. 


*Great game by Phoenix in the 4th :(",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
DEVIN ARMANI BOOKER IS THAT GUY,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Felt like a playoff game,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
No reason Booker can't be a top ten player in the league.,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
This team is hella frustrating to watch,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Great 3 point shooting by Booker last 2 games. No overreaction but Booker with a 3 point shot is the mvp,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"The question shouldn’t be whether DBook is an allstar or not, it should be whether he’s a superstar already or not.",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Felt like a playoff game. The only problem I had with this game is the ref. The Hawks were not allowed to play physical at all in the 4th. Trae needs to be smart with the ball. Don't need to shoot deep three in the last 2mins of the quarter. Fun game overall.,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
I could really see this team being 4-10 out of this road trip,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Bump him down to the second best bogdanovic in the league,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Don't like the Suns forcing so many threes, especially my boy Cam, but wow Book and Mikal are just so smart I don't even care.",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzFxwYWnttc,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Chris Paul is nba all defensive team if they let him defend like that,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Hawks have a lower winning pct this year than when Lloyd Pierce was fired last year,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Kaminsky is playing great this season. Deserves more minutes than Mcgee.,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Trae “regular season is boring” Young

Hold the L kid.",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Horrible plays drawn up by the Hawks at the end

Wtf was that airball",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Blow the team up,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
Time to sell Hawks stock and invest in Ben Simmons coin.,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
FUCK THESE REFS!! CP3 could commit murder and it still wouldn't be called. jesus fucking christ!,qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks
"Trae contested 3 and Bogdan catch and shoot off the pick a meter behind the 3pt line aren't the best shots I could imagine getting... but maybe that's just me, Nate you do your thing bro.",qoh14h,Phoenix Suns,Atlanta Hawks

But Goddamn he is so fucking trash..like even if he was paid 15-20 million...These stat lines after 2-3 games is so fucking frustrating..I get where all the Westbrook haters come from...Un fucking believable..

Lilard wasn't shooting well yet distributed the ball all these games  and this mf had 6 assists and 6 turnovers...What the fuck...

And yeah I know Lebron wanted him..Just because Lebron made a stupid decision doesn't mean I can't show frustration to Westbrook's trash playing..

"I will repeat this to death: Russ is completely washed and he was like this for 3 years now! He will eventually ""bounce back"" against a shitty team with a shittier competition than todays Blazers (and that says all) and just shooting the ball 15 to 20 times with shit efficiency and statpadding bad for rebound and assist will make you fool to follow him.

In reality, Russ I a washed player by now who they just need to stop playing. Trading for him the last 3 times it happens doomed the team (if not for the Wizards which had found a dumbass organisation giving shit ton of value for an ex-player). It is really sad to see a once great player been ridiculoulized by himself only because he pretend to be still good. Meanwhile, Russ is putting up horrendous numbers on absurd ammount of possession for a player of his level.

When you all will realise he is below average player by pure skill set and comprehension of the game?? 

Russ need to retire so bad, and I really think this will be his last year, he is failing bad by now and he is being even worst than last  year.",qohebt,Portland Trail Blazers,Los Angeles Lakers

Lakers playing 2012's greatest hits isn't working so far. Looking like a first or second round team at best if Lebron can return and stay healthy.

"I consider this current Raptors squad as a legitimate playoff team in the East. Hence, this W by the Nets is definitely a welcome sign.

Giving up 5 offensive rebounds to Harden is killer man,qozx9i,Brooklyn Nets,Toronto Raptors

"Once we get Birch back and Siakam’s minutes scale up to normal I think we’ll be in really good shape.

Also, Boucher is on DNP watch. Precious should see a heavy drop in minutes too. Both will look nearly unplayable once we’re at full strength.",qozx9i,Brooklyn Nets,Toronto Raptors
"People are going to focus on the defence, which wasn't what it could be, but you're playing the Nets and they're just another level on offence so I'm really not that worried about it. 

What I really want is more ball movement on offence. Our offence looks terrible. Some of this is down to personnel, but the amount of isolation basketball we play for good stretches is central to the anemic outcome. 

I understand we don't want to put too much pressure on Barnes on that end. I think this is a good strategy for his development. Nevertheless, I really would like them to run some high post act through either Barnes or Siakam. In a line-up with one centre, put Birch/Precious in the dunker spot/low post, run 3 shooters through some cut action, and get something going. I really think Barnes could thrive running a few plays a game through the high post.",qozx9i,Brooklyn Nets,Toronto Raptors
Seeing all the other threads before this I thought the nets had lost haha.,qozx9i,Brooklyn Nets,Toronto Raptors
Great game. Devastating 2nd half by the raps couldn't hit any threes and NN fucked us by having svi play zone defense for too long. We play this game in later in the szn again and we have a much better chance.,qozx9i,Brooklyn Nets,Toronto Raptors
"Really weird game from the Raps. Too many iso plays and defensive breakdowns. We usually move the ball much better than this and have much better defensive rotations. But some great positives to take away, Siakam looked good, Scottie Barnes is not scared of anybody on defense, and Gary Trent Jr. turning into DeMar DeRozan is just an added bonus lol.",qozx9i,Brooklyn Nets,Toronto Raptors

Actually I read that many of you were not happy with Nurse scheme, you might tell me what you think was a better game plan?

THE EAST RUNS THROUGH CLEVELAND,qp2ruw,Cleveland Cavaliers,New York Knicks
The fact that Mobley and Allen can play together makes this cavs team seem pretty legit. really makes them tough defensively,qp2ruw,Cleveland Cavaliers,New York Knicks
"I wanted Rubio to go to a winning team for the longest time, never knew that it would be Cleveland though...

Not mad though.",qp2ruw,Cleveland Cavaliers,New York Knicks
"Cavaliers demand to be taken seriously. This was a good win on the Knicks. But on the real though who expected ricky Rubio to be a secret weapon for the Cavaliers?

It’s hard to beat a team that was shooting like they were. Wasn’t even bad defense imo just solid offense.",qp2ruw,Cleveland Cavaliers,New York Knicks
Ricky 3-bio,qp2ruw,Cleveland Cavaliers,New York Knicks
"We have played every other night all season, 8 of 11 on the road, down 4 guys in our rotation (please be OK Collin)...and yet here we are.

No words needed.,qp2ruw,Cleveland Cavaliers,New York Knicks
Feels good to have a real team,qp2ruw,Cleveland Cavaliers,New York Knicks
The Cavs the last few wins have really phased out those really bad quarters where we just do nothing and lose big.  Impressive stuff.  Maybe J.B. Bickerstaff is the real deal man.,qp2ruw,Cleveland Cavaliers,New York Knicks
LeBron boutta head back to Cleveland,qp2ruw,Cleveland Cavaliers,New York Knicks
"Congrats Cavs. Mobley is looking amazing. As a Raptors fan I was definitely hoping he would fall to us. And, for what it's worth, word is that Mobley was supposedly Masai's first pick. He even tried to trade up for him. The last time he tried to trade up in a draft was a skinny kid from Greece. Just for some perspective.",qp2ruw,Cleveland Cavaliers,New York Knicks

Also shoutout to Wendell Carter.  He's such a stud.  He plays excellent defense and now that he has the 3 ball down he's a legit stretch 2 way  big.   He's everything Magic fans think Mo Bamba is and this was actually a good Mo Bamba game.  Also this was by far Suggs worst game.

Did anything good come from putting the ball in Mitchell's hands down the stretch for the Jazz? I guess the one assist to Gobert but Mitchell was bad in this one.,qp2roi,Orlando Magic,Utah Jazz
"Jazz gambled for the steal at the end which if you look at it percentage wise isn’t really that bad of a gamble. The other was to foul or play hard defense. Which both are kind of garbage. 

More importantly though the Magic just countered it with classic “pass to an open shooter” and at that point it’s a make or miss league.",qp2roi,Orlando Magic,Utah Jazz

"Solid move taking Buddy out in clutch time to let Fox stink up the offense.  Nice Luke.  HoF playcalling.  Remember when everyone thought you were good when you ""coached"" one of the best teams in history for a little while?

Oh and nice inbounds play with 2.5 seconds left.  Have everyone just go to the other end of the court for a hail mary?  Don't have Buddy streak and try to catch on the run for a decent shot or anything.  It's not like he literally did that at the end of the 1st.  God I can't stand this coach.",qp2ux2,Indiana Pacers,Sacramento Kings
"God that was so frustrating. Pacers played hard but Christ. Game was there for the taking and we missed so many good shots. Nobody could get their shot going tonight, especially that first half. Hovered around 35% shooting all night.",qp2ux2,Indiana Pacers,Sacramento Kings
"Fox and Holmes played like shit this game. We're ten games in and Fox has played well in 2 of them. 

If ya'll puzzled about Hali's last shot, Barnes was the first option but couldn't get open. Holmes got Hali a good look and wide open shot and he bricked it horribly.

Edit: We also haven't won a game with Mark Jones commentating. 0-3 with him lol",qp2ux2,Indiana Pacers,Sacramento Kings

"I’m so f’ing impressed by this team.

Giannis is being overworked. I know we have injuries and we want to win games but playing him 39 mins is not ideal. He has to carry a ton of defensive and offensive load single-handedly,qp2tr1,Milwaukee Bucks,Washington Wizards

"What’s wild is, since the roster construction has finally ironed out… double teaming Steph so much isn’t the greatest plan right now lol. Everyone’s moving constantly creating more openings while Steph is pulling the defence towards him. 

The one play I keep remembering was where two defenders tried to pin Steph near the left elbow, he makes the pass. People keep moving and they keep pinging the ball around and find a wide open shooter for a three. The problem with Steph is how much he moves, but now the whole damn team is replicating this. It’s amazing to watch",qp5ex6,Golden State Warriors,Houston Rockets
"At some point, people are going to have to admit that Steve Kerr is doing an amazing job",qp5ex6,Golden State Warriors,Houston Rockets
"Love the motion offence till now. GP2 keeps impressing and OPJ, Bjeli doing their thing. Poole party goes on.
2 things to take note of
1. Need more iso/PnR plays to get Steph into shooting and scoring rhythm. Can't have passive Steph for the playoffs
2. Definitely need better paint Defence in the non-Dray mins. Hope Wiseman can cure that",qp5ex6,Golden State Warriors,Houston Rockets

box plus-minus is weird. Porter was so important in this game. he went 5-6 from 3PT range and the three 3s that he scored in a row completely killed the Rockets’ momentum and basically sealed the win... but then he’s a minus-3 for the game.,qp5ex6,Golden State Warriors,Houston Rockets

22-0 run to end the game. Borrego is out of his depth and needs to go. We fall apart at the first sign of adversity and the only consistent factor for this team is the complete lack of defense. All of Mitch's signings this offseason have been an abject disaster and we literally would have been better just doing nothing but whatever 2K auto-sim recommends.

"With 2 minutes left, Randle is sizing up Niang after being on a heater and Kemba does the ""jump up and down with your arms up"" thing to seem like HE deserves the ball in crunch time because he made one floater. This was Randle's crunch time and Kemba better not pull that sh-t in the playoffs. I am not a Knicks fan, but players and fans can tell who's crunch time it is and this was not Kemba's.

(Btw, Kemba missed another high floater bank shot over Drummond.)",qptgq4,New York Knicks,Philadelphia 76ers

"Talk about Russ, Buddy, Kuz, and KCP all you want. The only objectively clear mistake the Lakers made with no logical justification is letting Caruso go. One of the dumbest moves I’ve ever seen a sports team make in years. 

He’s a great bench piece, he’s not pricey, and he’s a fairly popular NBA star. What’s not to want? He alone doesn’t win a ring for LA, but he makes it A LOT easier. Just utterly stupid of Jeanie Buss to “save” tax money, and hypocritical especially after saying she’d spare no expense to win. Coulda made more money by winning another ring with LABron and having another young mainstream name on the roster.

Hit an open three and two more buckets off of pick and rolls in the fourth. We need him to score. I'm glad be was able to finish this game off by hitting those open shots.

"This team just constantly finds new ways to make themselves look even more pathetic than they already were. 

I feel like KAT is just never a guiding force down the stretch. It's always turnovers or bad shots or getting frustrated on defense and never just putting his head down and getting a bucket. He was nonexistent down the stretch when the Grizzlies went on that run. He just has to be more consistent than that, we can't build this team around him and have him disappear for these periods.",qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies

"KAT and Ja gonna get all the spotlight this game, but the real star was Brandon Clarke",qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies
"JJJ had a brutal first 3 Quarters but he made up for it big time in the 4th and early in OT with two big stops on KAT.

Ja Morant also did his usual thing late in the 4th, which is just takeover. If you are not watching the Grizzlies you should be. They're not only a good team, but a fun team to watch.",qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies

Clarke had a great bounce back game. Happy to see him play well.",qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies
I don't like basketball anymore,qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies
"This is a good, honest .600 basketball team. We play .600 ball goddammit. Salt of the earth, punch the clock, even win/loss ratio basketball. We lose a couple, guess what? We win a couple, too. But we never get too excited or let it go to our head. No long winning streaks here, no sir. That's hubris, which this blue collar, hard working everyman team doesn't have. A few wins in a row, these guys, true to form, balances it out with a couple a losses. Yes sir, this is my 2021-22 Grizzlies. A good, honest .600 basketball team.

You thought I was gonna say .500, huh? PSYCH, NOT TONIGHT BITCH. 

In all seriousness, wow what a game. We were up 9 in the 3rd and then fuck that up to go down 11 at the start of the 4th, down 16 with 7:30 left to go. We then claw back. Forced misses, blocks (by JJJ), rebounds. Then there was a whole bunch of turnover calls. We were close to clutching the game in regular time but KAT then makes an insane buzzer beater. But we wrapped it up in OT. GG WP Timbs. What a fricking game. Last time as well was insane with Ant scoring 42.

Ja, BC ran the show. Melt, JJJ, SlowMo, Bane helped clutched it.",qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies
So that late 8-second call against the Grizzlies... Doesn't the clock have to hit 15?,qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies
Brandon Clarke had himself a game! He was huge in OT after Jaren fouled out with multiple boards and buckets,qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies
"This is the first time I've watched the wolves this season, do they always look that brainless?",qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies
Grizzlies -5 had a 1% chance of covering with 1:30 left and it covered. I will never miss another Grizzlies Timberwolves matchup,qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies

Can’t leave the door open with Ja & Co. around.,qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies
"I mentioned this in the game thread, but I'm still waiting for the Wolves to figure out what they have in Patrick Beverly. I know they got him for defense, but he is a good starting point guard. When he and Edwards are on the floor together, 4/5 times Edwards takes it up the court and improvises something. Beverly knows how to run a play and take time, and he isn't selfish with the ball. He can read the court. 

Further, Patrick Beverly can shoot: currently, he has the highest effective field goal percentage on the team, and is second in 3P% (43% compared to KAT's 49%). I like Edwards, but he's not a mature player.",qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies
The Wolves are the definition of a black pill,qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies
There is very little that is more depressing than the Timberwolves wasting KAT and Anthony Edward's time together.,qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies

"People are blaming KAT, Ant, and Dlo, but I think it’s clearly a coaching issue. The Timberwolves offense was pretty much have them take turns ISOing with literally no offball movement. KAT, Ant, DLo are all talented offensive players, but you are not going to play winning efficient basketball if they are just taking turns driving at 3 defenders. It is the coaches job to create a system that utilizes his player’s talents and that clearly isn’t happening. 

Don’t blame the players, blame the coach that has them playing this hideous offensive system.",qpv1cp,Minnesota Timberwolves,Memphis Grizzlies

">Here's your Dallas Mavs Post Game Summary. Now in our 6th Season. 6️⃣

Damn this post game thrad took a while to get posted ⏳

Did the Mavs win? ✅ Glad we didn't let that one slip away there at the end

Don't let the score fool you. This game was a lot closer than the score would say but also not close. This game really had everything from being a ±4 game for 75% and a blowout got 20%. 📈📉

Luka with a solid though quiet game for him tonight with 25/5/5  🇸🇮👍💤

KP ***only*** had 12/8/3 tonight but if you watched the game you'd know he scored some of if not the biggest points of the first half to get the Mavs the lead and stay in front for the rest of the game and then hit a big 3 in the late 4th to keep us above water 👍🇱🇻🦄

Timmy with 17/6/4 tonight on good shooting sinking 4 3's 👌💦

Brunson Burner continues his 6MOTY Campaign tonight with 17/4/6 to lead the bench in scoring ♨️💺6️⃣

Jokic vs Morris WRESTLEMANIA,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"Holy shit, Lowry

Almost 38 mins and nothing",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
I am looking at Lowry’s statline. And the first number I am seeing is a zero. Is this correct?,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"What I think will be interesting to see is how the referee’s call will effect any suspensions, because the call on the court ended up being flagrant 2 by Morris and unsportsmanlike conduct deserving of an ejection by Jokic. So the referees felt that the contact by Morris was deserving of a flagrant 2, and most players understandably get pissed when a flagrant 2 happens to them. I am not condoning Jokic’s actions and believe he should probably be suspended.",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"I don't condone the retaliation by Joker. But if the NBA allows these ""enforcer types"" to exist in the league like the Morris twins have for their entire careers, then they have to expect someone to respond to all the cheap and dirty plays",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"To everyone only shitting on Jokic while ignoring that Morris tackled him first: get bent. 

Morris fucked around and found out. If more players handled dirty fouls like that, maybe dirty ass players like the Morris brothers would learn their lesson.",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"Shame it ended the way it did because despite the loss I was having fun up until then.

Gg Nuggets.  Hopefully our next game is a bit calmer.",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"I mean look here, taking a hard elbow to the ribs isnt just an everyday foul, it was literally a flagrant 2. What you expect someone to just smile and laugh after getting elbowed in the ribs, Obviously id prefer if Jokic was not suspended but he isnt going to stand there and let people elbow him, half the people in this thread talking backing up morris would do the exact same thing if they were Jokic.",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Morris absolutely flew into Jokics ribs with his elbow why Jokic was in the air for no reason..and got his flagrant 2.. Not Flagrant 1 but 2. IT was not Jokic that started the altercation. SO stop acting like Morris did not get what he deserved. He is a dirty player and everybody knows it. I am actually happy to see Jokic dishing out what Morris needed. The man don't take no shit. I respect that. He didn't start it but he finished it.,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Fuck the Morris twins.,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Kyle Lowry lowlights incoming? 0% accuracy.,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Wtf Lowry scored 0,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"Death, taxes, and a Morris twin being a little bitch

what else is new?",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Jokic bodied the Heat out there,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Will Barton is going to have to average 50 pts a game when Jokic is inevitably suspended,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
jokic getting elbowed in the ribs is somehow less of an assault than getting pushed. wtf am i reading in this thread.,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"I'm not gonna excuse what Jokic did because it was real bad.

But you better blame Morris as well because what he did would have leveled a smaller man. Especially in a blowout with 3 minutes left",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Damn this was a crazy good game by jokic until the foul man.,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
what is jokic supposed to do there after that hard and cheap check? Just take that hard check from Morris like a bitch? Fuck that. I support it. Jokic MVP,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
This should be civil,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Probably the best the Nuggets have looked all season. Let’s keep this up bois,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Jokic does have a temper. You don't want to mess with him. And after all of it however Morris gets up and walks off the court. Just another acting job. Jokic did hit him hard ..BUt that was just acting mostly Morris threw himself down on the ground like Jokic killed him. Refs gave them both equal punishment they saw it as equally guilty. I doubt anything comes of it...Morris is not even hurt.. Stretcher was there because of the acting ...not because they needed one.,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"Morris deserved it, and I love Jimmy but he needs to stfu acting like he’s gonna do something to Jokic in the locker room",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat

"Well I'll take the win but I'd rather it not end like that.

I mean....,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"I know the ejections will overshadow the performance by Jokic, but he really dominated both ends of the floor, he’s locked in on defense and getting everything he can out of his body on that end.",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat

Jokic is the absolute man for that. Morris is dirty af,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Thing is it would have never happened if MOrris had not cheap shotted JOkic. Just put that in your memory banks..BUt maybe you people don't think people should stand up for themselves.,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat

"I was loving everything Jokic was doing this game on both ends of the floor, and won the day against a center in Bam Adebayo who regularly gives Giannis and other top big men indescribable fits…

…and then he goes ahead and commits the stupidest retaliation foul I’ve ever seen and almost guarantees himself a suspension and/or fine",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat

"All these Heat fans coming in here saying fuck Jokic is hilarious to me. While down double digits with 2 minutes left in the game, your guy flagrant 2s Jokic with a shot in the ribs and knee-to-knee contact on his standing leg that he just injured. Then tries to walk away like it was nothing. That’s the bitch move here. Don’t walk away like that and you don’t get a shot to the back; better yet, don’t commit a pointless, dirty foul when the game is over and this game ends with no hiccups. Jokic even admits he overreacted but y’all need to recognize your dude is a dirty player and brought that on himself, don’t stick up for that shit like a bunch of clowns. ‘Heat culture’ is about working hard and playing tough, not playing dirty like a bunch of sore losers.",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
"Fuck Morris. Dirty piece of shit, go get what you deserve bozo",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Markieff Morris be stayin salty,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Not a good move by Jokic but Morris shouldn’t have turned his back. If your going to hit someone hit them and get into it with them I have no idea why he turns his back to Jokic knowing how mad he gets lol. But people lose their cool and Jokic should have known better.,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
[deleted],qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat

Fuck jokic,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Denver was the better team but what a weak ass move by jokic. If you didn’t like the foul tell him something. Shove him to his face. Waiting till he turns around to cheap shot someone as hard as u can is a weak move,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Fun to read the comments on Jokics dirty play vs something like pat bevs push on CP3 in the playoffs.  Such a difference,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
Imagine the scrutiny Simmons or Westbrook would get if they dropped 0/3/4 with 3 turnovers in 38 minutes,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
My only issue is Joker could clearly see Morris coming. Jokic hit him at full speed when his back was turned. That’s what made it a bitch ass move,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat
“He had it coming to him” yes he deserves an elbow from a jokic size person to the spine /s,qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat

Now to be serious here for a second...I understand why Jokic was so mad because we were about to come back in that game towards the end.  We were winning the 4th quarter and about to shut the Nuggets down.",qpvx20,Denver Nuggets,Miami Heat

"Warriors might be the most synergistic team I've ever watched, their ability to convert offense to defense and defense to offense is literally unparalleled, they feed so well enough off one another which allows them to go on runs at a moments notice, 

Curry is a fucking alien from another galaxy, no human should be that good at shooting basketballs, let alone be able to drive, finish, pass, create, screen, and play solid D, masterful performance.

On another note this Warriors team is fucking scary rn, Hawks are a good matchup against them, back half of a B2B, and they found a way to grind out a win against a good Hawks team

Hawks had a really good offensive game plan for the 1st half, but got suckered into a shoot out in the 2nd half, 

Hawks decided to leave Steph in single coverage most of the game, using Hunter/Huerter/Reddish as the primary defenders, didnt work, this is why teams double Steph, once he gets in a rhythm its so damn hard to stop him

JTA deserves a shoutout, hit some clutch ass 3's and played good D

JK had a really nice 1Q debut, some nice moments mixed with lots of rookie mistakes, his individual defense is impressive though",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks

This Steph guy is kinda alright,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
War-DPOY Stephen Curry !,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"HAHA! Curry a great shooter, let alone player?! Well to be perfectly honest, in my humble opinion, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking at this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of one’s view and by trying to make it objective, and by considering each and everyone’s valid opinion, I honestly believe I completely forgot what I was going to say.﻿",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
50/10/7 on 50% shooting. 10 3pt. MVP.,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Curry went so crazy celebrating that I was scared he'd get a heart attack,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
John Collins only had 7 shot attempts. FUCKING SEVEN,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"Are third quarter Warriors a fucking problem again?

Yes.",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"Guess who's back back,

 Back again,

 3rd quarter warriors are back, 

To fuck up the league again.",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks

"As much as I loved having KD, this team is just so much more fun to watch without his iso game.",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Ok fine. Steph Curry still best Curry.,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"For those who aren't familiar, Warriors getting dunked in the 2nd quarter and coming back with a ridiculous 3rd quarter is par for the course this year.

Who’s next?,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Can someone tell me what’s going on with the Hawks? Haven’t watched them this year,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Is it time to be concerned about the Warriors?,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
I have a serious question. Is any team not named Grizzlies even going to defeat this team????,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks

steph has gotta be the front runner for mvp so far,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
what a third quarter,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Curry is in real MVP form this year.,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"Can any real basketball expert (which I'm not) tell me what the Warriors do to adjust that causes them to consistently perform so well in the 3rd quarter (a phenomenon that appears somewhat consistent across several years now)? As in, are they actually making visible adjustments to their lineup or the way they run their offense or defense, in some way that is exceptional compared to other teams?",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"This was one of Curry’s best all round games, he was on one in all aspects of the game",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
I’m just salty Kuminga missed a free throw and we went 21/22.,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
There may come a time when the warriors lose a game again... BUT TODAY IS NOT THAT DAY!,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"Bring in some ""serious"" teams please
Steph is hungry",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"I don't know man. I see Nate doing the same non sense that Lloyd Pierce was doing.

Keeping in the bench for way too long and allowing the other teams starters to take the advantage, not calling timeouts to cut the momentum, no play calling (JC barely touched the ball after an incredible first half).

What the hell is going on, we look nothing like we did in the 2nd half of last year + playoffs.",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
that end of the third was just brutal,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Curry was on his JR swish tonight. Hitting all the ridiculous shot and missing the gimmes,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"Dread it.

Run from it.

Third Quarter Warriors, still arrive.",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"Gary Payton and Steph combining for 6 steals, same as the whole Atlanta team.. sheesh",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks

"I'd just like to address all the people who were talking shit in the second quarter and say:

lol, suck it",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Steph curry is just built different period and this entire game showed you why,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Steph led the team or was tied for most in every stat on the team tonight lmao,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Thank you Steph,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
This one was for Andy Liu,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
3Q Warriors are back and here to stay,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
You got to tip your hat!!,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
What the fuck man,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
This team is starting 9-1 and are still waiting to add Klay back (🤞 no other issues for him),qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
I'm surprised the Hawks didn't feed Collins in the post more. We had no answer for him,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Hit the bookies where it hurts folks. 3rd Quarter Warriors are back and 81-1 is on the table until it isn’t.,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"GP² with 2nd highest +/- and he fouled out, and only scored 2. What a fucking stud!!?",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"And then you realize the Warriors are missing their other HoF shooter and young center.

Long season, but this team has 2015-2016 vibes. Except Curry is (somehow) better.",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
GPII fouled out to a standing ovation. Guy become a fan favorite in less then 10 games.,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Man GG Warriors. Curry is still Curry and is terrifying. That said what is going on with this team so far? I expected them to be so much better than this this season and they have struggled. Really need the boys to start picking it up here. The talent is there. Just gotta start winning games.,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Little worried about Steph's shoulder tbh.,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
I know it's only ten games in but I'm excited. Reminds me so much of the pre super team era and I love it,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
It’s a shame the Regular season is too boring for the Hawks,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Nate McMillan tricked y’all man,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
Maybe I keep thinking about the Steph comparisons but Trae needs to move without the ball more. He was killing the Warriors the first half with his floaters but the Warriors were hounding him and just denying him the ball 2nd half and he just stays in the back.,qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks
"Wonder how many people were waiting to say ""told you so"" at half before Trae Young's dad shut them up. So inspirational.",qpwpx2,Golden State Warriors,Atlanta Hawks

People forget that the suns were second seed last season for a reason,qpwsc5,Phoenix Suns,Sacramento Kings
I just want a 20 or 30 point blowout game to calm my nerves man.,qpwsc5,Phoenix Suns,Sacramento Kings

"People tell me DBook can’t take that next step because he doesn’t defend, pass, or rebound. I must not be watching the same Devin Booker as them, because he’s does all of those very well.

Cam Payne is a top 5 backup pg in the league and it’s not some “oh good for him” shit anymore, dude is a problem.

Mikal is a legitimate 40% 3pt shooter nowadays, and damn that’s real nice lol.

Javale McGee was unironically one of the best signings of the off season. Exactly what the Suns needed, a stop gap when Ayton isn’t in the game. Rebounding, defense, rim protection, very good finishing, penalizing switches in the post, and good screens when Ayton isn’t in the game.... damn, isn’t that nice. 

Thank god for that amazing 3rd quarter, bc that 4th was rough. Opposite night I guess.",qpwsc5,Phoenix Suns,Sacramento Kings

"The Kings turnovers man. I don’t know how many turnovers the Kings committed in the first half, but that third quarter really sucked the life out of the stadium. I suppose it didn’t help seeing so many jumpers miss. 

But I loved seeing that defensive energy midway through the last quarter. When you force turnovers and run you’re fun. But credit to Paul to get that steadying alley-pop to McGee to make it 107-100. That was the clincher in the end. 

Oh and that Booker charge was great. 

Suns 6-3 despite the hangover of the finals series is not bad",qpwsc5,Phoenix Suns,Sacramento Kings
Where would the Lakers be without Carmelo?,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"i miss lebron, watching lakers try to close a game is disgusting 

if the last shot is gonna be AD contest jumpers, why not just go to Melo",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"This is my admission of guilt for thinking that Carmelo Anthony was ever washed post OKC when he got traded around/cut/bought out a few times.

Also though, what the fuck was the end of that game lmao Russel Westbrook’s brain farts per 36 stats are absolutely outrageous",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"They may have had LaMelo, but we had LA Melo

Staples Center Melo is built different",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers

"It’s funny the lakers essentially pulled the reverse of the clippers last night, they played a pretty great game for three quarters, and then started making seemingly 1000 mistakes in the fourth. 

The five free throws was hilarious but also probably some bullshit for the refs to play such a major factor.",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Rondo won't get the game ball but he played some huge minutes,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"Another total collapse in the second half to cap off a 5 game losing streak! We clawed back because the Lakers decided to gift away FTs but yeah. We are already losing ground in our eternal race to finish .500 while going on six straight years in the lottery. I'm glad we decided to rebuild by near-maxing out expensive injury-prone role players who fail to show up every other game, but at least the 25 million dollar man shot better than 25% from the field tonight. 

Our HC marked a top 15 defense as his primary goal for the season and we are dead last! For a Popp disciple it's pretty funny that his teams have seemingly 50 turnovers a game and no composure when things get tough. Also three defensive 3s in a single game, like how is that even fucking possible?",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"For a team filled with veterans the Lakers were really not able to keep their temper at all.

There are pieces and plays that work, but the offense through Westbrook needs to change, because as it stands Rondo seems like a better choice for a starter.

I still believe Westbrook can make it work with the team this season, but Vogel and Lebron really need to help him understand to play to his strengths, cut down the risky passes, and stop going for the 3s that team are daring him to take. It’s frustrating because you see flashes of how he could make his game work, but then emotions get the best of him.

This season has barely started and with this style of play it has felt like an eternity. Only 71 more games to go.",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"TBF to Westbrook while he had 7 TO's, if we look at the ones that were actually his fault then he really only had 11 TO's.",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers

The lakers won but did they actually?,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"This probably isn’t going to make sense, but I’ll give it a shot. It seems like Russ usually gets his stats/triple doubles *while* the Lakers win, whereas Lamelo/Lebron/other players get their triple doubles to help their teams win",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers

"Melo being the best player on the Lakers rn is uh, concerning to say the least

WB continues to play like ASS, turnstile on defense, braindead on offense, got that sweet Triple Double though, why on earth did the Lakers trade for him?

FO needs to come under some heat for this roster construction, the lack of wings is confusing

Hornets starters are legit but that bench is sus AF, need to upgrade via trade, definitely need a competent backup C

Miles Bridges is legit but he needs to work on his defense

Why does AD keep trying to play like hes KD on offense?  Your a center not a wing, play like one 

Do the Lakers have an offensive system?  Genuinely curious cuz from what i can tell they spam iso's and PnR almost at random

Lakers perimeter D is offensively bad, each dude out their just gets broken down so easily it doesnt matter who the rim protector is, if they're constantly hung out to dry theyll give up buckets.

2003 NBA Draft carrying the Lakers rn,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Man the Lakers love blowing big leads in the 4th quarter to the dumbest of reasons this time we lost a large lea because of 5 straight free throws lmfawe really gifted them 5-7free points  in 1 minute l,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
They are the exact opposite of a flowing offense. I can't wait for lebron to come back so they can establish an identity. Melo can't keep saving this offense.,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
This shit was insane,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"Wtf were those 5 straight free throws? I was just laughing cuz I did not know what was happening at all.

Shoutout to Melo. His shooting has saved the season so far. Lakers need some better late game execution though. I guess it'll get better with LBJ.",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"Great game even though the hornets lost, lamelo needed to take that last shot",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Can’t believe that Rondo ejection or the Hayward out of bounds call. Wtf are these refs doing lol,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Lakers offence is tough to watch sometimes,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
CARMELLLLLLLLO ANTHONYYYYY,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Carmelo is unbelievable,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"The big 3 of LeBron, AD, and Melo need some better role players",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
The Charlotte hornets took the Lakers to overtime and only lost by three. That's wild,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Carmelo Anthony is the greatest player in NBA history,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
If Melo continues to play at this level has he got a better shot at 6MOY over Herro?,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
This team makes me sad.,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Good win.,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Lakers look pretty good with Rondo^YesShade,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Westbrook is the Raheem Sterling of the Lakers. He can find a way to botch anything,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Vogel has to go soon,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
And nearly threw it away with that meltdown at the free throw line late in the 4th.,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Westbrook is playing horribly.,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Lakers looking at warriors beautiful basketball like wtf that should be us,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
It's wild to me that out of all the players they added it's old as hell Carmelo Anthony who's bailing them out next to AD.,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"Trade Russ to a team that needs him where he can be the man because I don’t think he’ll mesh with the lakers or at least right now, maybe fire Vogel or something because his rotations but there’s definitely some improvements needed",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Magic had a point when he called westbrook the worst point guard ever. Terrible basketball iq and tried his best to give the game away,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Refs couldn't win this one.,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
AD and Russ tried their hardest to lose those last few seconds of the 4th. Glad they pulled through,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"Awful basketball

Awful reffing

Awful offense and defense.

This game really just sucks",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"Didn't watch it, but Westbrook got 17-12-12...pretty good game.",qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
holy fuck russ is fucking TERRIBLE,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
Russ legit will run a 3on1 fast break and physically hand the ball to the 1 guy on D or just throw the ball into the 5th row of the stadium.,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
WB legit almost threw this game for us when we should’ve ended it in a blowout. Going from Rondo to Westbrook was the most painful thing I’ve seen this season. From great plays to back to back to back TOs and absolutely not flow on offense. I’ve always loved Westbrook but I hate him on my team. Cut his minutes ffs,qpxlho,Charlotte Hornets,Los Angeles Lakers
"Bball Paul will be a household name soon

And maxey",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Maxey is an amazing player. Reed can be a serious contributer.

Sixers put a great fight, just way to undermanned",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
I figured out who Bobby Portis looks like… now hear me out…. Eminem,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
That game had no business being that fun,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
One hell of a game by the Sixers without Embiid. It looked grim in the 4th.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
gRAYson ALLEN,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"This game has to be really encouraging if you’re a Sixers fan. They really battled with so many guys out and Maxey looked like a star. 

As a Bucks fan, Grayson Allen has looked great this year, I love Giannis and I’m ready for Khris and Brook to come back.",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"ughhhhh man I've been coming into these 6 man lineup games with zero expectations and then we always make it close and then I get invested lmfao

at least maxey had a really incredible game. super encouraging to watch",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Such a great effort, down so many players, 5th game in 7 nights. So proud",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
So proud of this squad tonight off a b2b and against the defending champs. Love the chemistry.. keep Simmons tf away from this group,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Sixers were as gassed as Kimbo Slice and Dada 5000 in the 4th

Every single shot was either short or a Drummond tip in",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
What the hell is your user op,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
so maxey is basically 6 foot giannis,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Hey can we talk about how dogshit Reggie Miller is? Dude called shake “Shake Middleton” and Paul Reed “Patrick” numerous times. 

Also gg bucks. Grayson was a killer tonight",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"GG 76ers, y'all kicked ass for being so depleted and Maxey is incredible - fuck the announcer for saying you need a PG when you have him",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Damn Sixers didn’t have their finisher and look incredibly lethal. Honestly this Sixers team looks mentally tougher than the last few years.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
u/brooklopezthedpoy in absolute shambles,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Lol and Ian Eagle ends the broadcast by randomly bashing Maxey and saying the sixers need a point guard. Trash broadcaster.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Georges Niang is the French Tatum,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Fuck I hate Grayson Allen he’s a sniper,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Gonna need a full series with these two teams with everyone healthy.

The game was such a fight the entire four quarters",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Furkan Coldmaz
😭",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Moral victories aren't a thing but the past two nights are moral victories. Our team is deep and when the starting 5 are back out there I expect very good things to happen.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
hell of a game from the sixers,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
how did this man giannis end with one foul,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Niang Gang til I die,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
*defeat the Delaware Blue Coats lol,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Great game all around. This sixers squad is incredibly entertaining. Tyrese Maxey could have been a top 10 pick. Gg bucks,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Not a doc defender at all nor do I miss him, but It’s still really weird watching a doc rivers team. Embiid’s supporting cast is one of the better and doc rivers-Ier squads I think. I wouldn’t underrate them.",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"This Sixers team is too likeable, man.",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
God damn it… the bucks have made me like Grayson Allen….,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
This Sixers team is a threat for a championship.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Really impressive from the undermanned Bucks. Did we mention that they were undermanned? Just checking,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"There's a timeline where the Bucks don't trade for Grayson Allen and in that timeline I would have stopped watching this team play Basketball and lead a fulfilling, happy, life.",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Damn we really the most unlucky team in the league. Multiple very important and vaccinated players out with covid. I guess atleast the bench is good.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Maxey was a guy I liked a lot if the C's wanted to go with a potential Kemba replacement during the 2020 draft, so seeing him do well for the Sixers is filling me with a lot of conflicting feelings.",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
NGL didn’t expect grayson Allen to be good in the NBA lol,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
How many Alley Oop attempt did the sixers stop by grabbing Giannis ? 3 ? 4? That's was kinda funny to watch. If Grayson Allen keep it up his contract is a steal,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
I’m sure Grayson Allen is a really lovely guy but man I wanna punch him and his Kate Gosselin haircut in the face so bad,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Bucks needed this as well. Any win without Khris, Brook and Donte will be taken. Grayson has been a good addition.",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Bucks needed that one more than Philly did. Here's hoping the next matchup both squads are healthy. Maxey is a beast,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"League and ready for a healthy Sixers; especially with a Ben Simmons feature, or a post Ben trade.",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Shaq is a sherif no? He has to abide by the law.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, we are one Ben Simmons trade away from being legit contenders, we’ve never been this deep and competitive before",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"damn maxey looked real good tonight, i've always been high on both him and quick but tyrese's second year jump has been beyond what i expected. obviously defensively he'll never sniff simmons but offensively this kid is already really good and his aggressiveness is just what philly needs. grayson allen too... bucks bot their bogi-esque player.",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Philly's got a nice deep bench.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Sixers game it all. And then Giannis just said “l will win the game :)”,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
League don’t want this smoke and ya know it,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Furkan ""Russell Westbrook"" Korkmaz",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"I really hate how much I'm starting to like Grayson Allen. Man, do I like that haircut.",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Korkie Borchek was unhinged and awful,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
That was the first time I heard Grayson Allen speak,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Chuck is right. Should be equal punishment.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Finally a win,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"I like how this thread is the complete opposite from yesterday.

Mfs were mad as hell for some reason, but in this one everyone seems calm. 😂",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Well that was a game of basketball,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"So impressive how the Bucks were able to win this game despite being down so so many players

They somehow overcame this Sixers juggernaut",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"We can say the Bucks barely beat the depleted Sixers all we want, but when they needed to close they honestly flipped the switch. Close game that did not feel too close",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Someone needs to show Reggie Miller that Nick Nurse video regarding Drummond,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Despite the entire team having covid/injuries, a B2B against a team with fresh legs and an absolute ***refusal*** to call a fucking offensive foul, we stayed in this. Proud of these young dudes",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"giannis is by far the premiere foul baiter in the league now.

&#x200B;

run into defender --> fall over --> look at ref --> FTA

run for an ""alley oop"" --> jump into someone --> scream --> FTA

&#x200B;

wonder why no one cares he's exploiting the refs like this smh",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Hate to say it but the sixers put up a hell of fight and show against the reigning champs and all without their superstar player. Ben.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Grayson Allen is looking like a perfect fit for the Bucks. 

Once everyone is back, Milwaukee is gonna be scary",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Congrats to the defending champs for beating the 7 Sixers by 9 points! 🙌🏾👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Never have I thought that Grayson Allen would help a Wisconsin basketball team.

Dude just flat out shoots so well",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Very entertaining game, maybe the bucks woke up a little bit.  Can't wait till all teams are healthy and we get some fantastic gameplay.",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
What happened with that technical that got called and then not enforced? They stopped the play but didn't make a call. Did a fan say something that they thought a sixers player/coach did? What happened here? I just want to know!,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"As a Bucks fan, I honestly almost missed Embiid's antics tonight. Didn't feel like a true Bucks-Sixers game like the past couple of years. Something was definitely missing, that was it",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Healthy 76ers are the best team in league right now not the warriors,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Giannis could sleep walk to 30/15/3,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Refs awful again, I don’t know how Giannis gets away with so much lmao. GG bucks dudes, see y’all when we’re healthy",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
FOR FUCK SAKE STOP SHOOTING KORK. What an absolute black hole on offense tonight and he just kept on shooting..,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers

"I love how Sixers fans play the victims all the time, like we didnt miss 3 starters.

Anyway, we need to fix our offense and get Giannis some rest",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
How do you rescind a technical foul?,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
It’s come to a point where I just watch games on mute. Between our new female announcer and the brain dead morons nationally it’s just unbearable.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
It ain’t easy being the best team in the NBA,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Giannis' Free Throw percentage sucking again makes me sad but glad he always sons the Sixers last several times he played them lol.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
oh yes,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
What happened to Grayson Allen’s top lip,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Was grayson this good in Memphis?,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"Damn, who would have thought Maxey has more trade value than Ben now",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
It’s a good sign seeing Korkmaz trying so many three’s even on a bad night. 1-12. This nights happen but for sure he’ll repeat the good ones. I really like this guy,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
2-18 shooting? Good lord,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Dang bruh korkmaz just kept shooting that thang,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
Why do the Sixers throw up so many 3’s when they are missing top players? Is it a matter of hit and hope?,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
korkmans what u doin,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
The Bucks were 4 - 6? I've not really heard much about them this year. It's all Lakers are awful. I've heard a little about Atlanta and Phoenix not looking great but I would have thought the Bucks were just up to their usual shenanigans.,qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers
"so no embiid, simmons, harris, or curry for sixers? that's brutal they can't be expected to win at that point",qqk8gs,Milwaukee Bucks,Philadelphia 76ers

I’m hot for Huerter,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
When Rudy and Don are locked in they are a scary duo,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
The game went about how I expected it to. Atlanta being short handed and on short rest would’ve had to had Young go nuclear to have a chance. Too bad both times we played Atlanta this year they were on the second night of a back to back,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Hoping for a nice Jazz run of Ws now that they got a nice long home stretch after 10 games in a row in different cities.,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks

I thought they were going to take a step forward after their playoffs run",qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"That Donovan defense in the fourth was sexy, holy shit what an improvement from him this season.",qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"Absolute worst part of these games, besides the fact we can't play defense, can't beat teams missing one of their core players (Mitchell in Jazz game 1, Ayton for the suns and the Klayless warrior, have scoreless droughts that continue even after timeouts, a useless bench that can't score and plays full 5 mins all bench stretches, and Clint is a useless sack of shit is that Trae has been efficient in these Ls. Which means we are bound to continue this losing streak when he shoots 6/23 against the Magic",qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Hawks 19/50 2FG,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
[deleted],qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Another game that I don't think we played that poorly. We're just in the middle of a brutal schedule and tonight in particular was always gonna be rough on a back to back against a team like Utah while missing two starters.,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Our schedule has been brutal as fuck which is a shame but I’m not gonna let that excuse how pathetic this team looks . I can only take watching Cam throwing the ball at the back board or out of bounds for so long,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Why do we have to play a good jazz team twice in 5 games both being in back to backs I don’t understand what this scheduling is.,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"Huerter is the best Kevin in the league, don't @ me Durant stans.",qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"Hawks are struggling a lot to start the season, what’s up with that?",qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
This team looks so lazy and undisciplined.  Accountability is nowhere to be found. That’s something that isn’t going away with an easy schedule.,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"For everyone coming in here saying “what’s going on, bad locker room? Is Nate actually shit?”

It’s Capela, and it’s also that OO is hurt.

The real issue is that we built our ENTIRE structure around having arguably the second best rim protector in the league behind Gobert in Capela last season and now the dude looks incredibly washed and our defense is leaking transition baskets after every bucket.

Trae has always taken questionable shots on OK efficiency, our 3pt shooting has never been consistent, and we’ve never really had anyone besides Trae to drive to the basket.

The difference was we had a dude who could outrebound anyone and was a viable escape valve for Trae on literally every drive and now we don’t.",qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Damn Atl has had a brutal schedule to start the year,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
someone has yet to post that Clarkson highlight. that was beautiful,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
every game you get a shot of pissed off mcmillian with his hands on his hips somewhere between the end of the 3rd quarter and the beginning of the 4th,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"The Hawks are not looking inspiring this year, we rank near the bottom of the league in every statistic that propelled us just a year prior. The worst part about all of this is that theres no easy solution and if you were to ask any two hawks fans about it they wouldn't give you the same answer.",qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"The amount of time Trae ran around the basket not attempting to shoot over Gobert. Hawks shot 18-35 from 3, for most teams that would keep the game close, these guys except Trae and Capela can't get to the rim.",qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks

The Jazz are lucky Cole Anthony doesn’t play for the Hawks!,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
There's a bunch of teams with whacky records right now. I think this may be the closest parity in teams the NBA has had in many years.,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"Per Jazz post game radio, the Hawks were the 10th team in NBA history to make at least 18 threes and not break 100 points in a game. None of those ten teams won their respective games.",qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Rough start to the season. Braves took all the mojo for this year.,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
Man the hawks getting passed around like a pack of cigarettes...,qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks
"Tbh hawks have had a brutal schedule just look back on it so far. I expect them to be close to .500 by the end of the month as it lightens up. 

The fact the Jazz are 8-3 with like a 10 PD with their hard schedule tells me they are still the team at the top of the west. Warriors need to show good stretches when the schedule gets rough.",qqlwv4,Utah Jazz,Atlanta Hawks

Best game by Bledsoe in a while.  Made some smart passes and looked good running plays with Hartenstein.  Also Batum was unreal.,qqmtgl,Portland Trail Blazers,Los Angeles Clippers

I don't get what Portland is doing to Dame.  Like if you're not gonna try and put a star next to him then just trade him for the sake of both parties.  Like why keep him if you're not trying to maximize what you can get out of him?,qqmtgl,Portland Trail Blazers,Los Angeles Clippers

And how about Beal instead of forcing a bad shot drives, absorbs the entire defense, and makes the pass to Kuz for the game winner.

WUJ for coach of the year. The turnaround has been tremendous. But Harrell and Kuzma have been awesome as well.",qraq45,Washington Wizards,Cleveland Cavaliers

We honestly shouldn’t have won this game but this team under WUJ is so much more better coached then we have been in the last 5-6 years.

"I thought for sure the Rockets would take this. Those last three possessions when they were down 2-3 made absolutely no sense. 

Is this loss on Silas? It’s not like age is an excuse here. Both teams are young and this game felt like it should have ended with a buzzer beater instead of the low percentage shots from the Rockets near the end.",qrbh5x,Detroit Pistons,Houston Rockets

Cade is way more shy than Green, dont try to takeover, but its cleary how much smart on the court he is than Green, that Clutch 2 was beautiful, when Grant starts choking, Cade took the ball and helped Pistons to win.

Randle’s game is kinda shitty to watch. When he’s leading, as opposed to Drose running plays, he just backs down a player into a contested turnaround fadeaway brick with 10 seconds left on the shot clock.

Randle ISOs aren’t hitting like last year just swing the ball for a better shot dude kills any momentum on the offensive side with these dumb long range 2s. 

Not checking but I feel like D rose has to be among the league leaders in +\- this year, the way he has been running the bench for us has been such a joy and a big positive for us this season. 

Offensive rebounds are killing us this year, and I feel like that’s something that needs to be emphasized after tonight. Can’t count how many times I seen the Bucks get a good look at a 3 after missing a shot or two.",qrb490,Milwaukee Bucks,New York Knicks

We didn't deserve to win this game but I still think that overturned foul was kinda bs. I don't see how taking out his left arm before even touching the ball isn't a foul but it is what it is.

"due to my fantasy interests I've been watching the twolves a lot this year, and man KAT just needs a change of scenery, idk what it is but he just doesn't look like he wants to be there, his body language has been really bad when he doesn't get the ball even if he gets shoved off the block and out of good position he still rolls his eyes and shakes his head like his teammates are to blame. I'm not a psychologist but clearly there's something deeper than just ""I'm playing on a bad team,"" the problem for him would be that there is no trade package out there that would be worth it to get him to a new situation",qrdyuv,Golden State Warriors,Minnesota Timberwolves

"Standouts- Wiggins and Looney.

We all saw Wiggins massacre KAT several times that game and Looney did his best to trouble KAT as well as grab 17 rebounds (17!) 

Payton had a great second quarter. We had a great second quarter in general. Third quarter was a bit ugly even before we lost Draymond, it just made it worse.

Porter had some nice offensive rebounds, really allowed us to make up for our shitty shooting night. Steph has a quiet 25, which is what makes him Steph. Andre was Andre with some great steals. Poole needs to be more consistent.

The refs were terrible but I think we ended up shooting a lot more free throws than the Wolves.

Honestly, the Wolves should be scarier. D'Lo, KAT, and Ant are great three point shooters, Beverly is an absolute pest on defense. But I guess after that their roster looks a little thin.

Got a little nervous when the lead went down to 4 but Porter kept us alive with his offensive rebounds and Wiggins extended the lead.

I knew it would be that kind of night for Wiggins when he scored the first seven points in a row. The man was on a mission. I only wish he was that aggressive every night.",qrdyuv,Golden State Warriors,Minnesota Timberwolves

Phenomenal game. Lakers won exactly how they needed to with Bron out. Shoot insanely good from 3 and have a bench star emerge. Monk was that guy tonight. I loved seeing the Bam v.

"I still fail to understand why Westbrook thinks that a pull three is a good shot for him.

Fortunately for them, the Heat struggled to make threes in regulation (Robinson and Lowry combining for 5/15) and free throws in overtime.

"Much better game from Boucher, especially in the second half. He's been playing like we know he can: following up on plays, crashing boards, defensive rotations. Gritty stuff.

Also, there have been some calling into question his chemistry with Scottie. We can clear any doubts with one occasion where Chris hypes up Scottie and one where Scottie hypes up Chris.

Y'all been kinda hard on him. He's still figuring it out after coming back from an MCL in an otherwise relatively major injury-free career (minus Oregon), which is surprising since he is pretty much four sticks and duct^^^duck tape.",qs149s,Philadelphia 76ers,Toronto Raptors

"Wish the NBA would revise those challenges with jump balls. It stopped momentum with an absurdly long review. Forced a jump ball after our fast break opportunity and led to the 3 that was the difference.

"This is the type of game Raptors would've lost last season. Woo happy they won they showed resilience down the stretch. Great poise by OG making those plays happen by driving in the paint. Scottie B was great in the 3rd, Mykhaliuk was making those little great plays and this was easily Chris Boucher's best game of the season. Also, Tyrese Maxey is relentless, I swear he's the basketball version of Speedy Gonzalez.",qs149s,Philadelphia 76ers,Toronto Raptors

"Perhaps the most infamous ‘fartomaniac’ was Adolf Hiter. I wrote about Hitler in a previous blog on coprophilia but according to his medical reports, Hitler is believed to have suffered from “uncontrollable flatulence”. The reason for this is thought to have been Hitler’s regular and seemingly relentless diet of prescription drugs and illicit drugs. His medical records also indicated that he took up to 28 different drugs to attempt to restrain his excessive flatulence. An article in Intelligent Life magazine noted that:

“Medical historians are unanimous that Adolf was the victim of uncontrollable flatulence. Spasmodic stomach cramps, constipation and diarrhea, possibly the result of nervous tension, had been Hitler’s curse since childhood and only grew more severe as he aged. As a stressed-out dictator, the agonising digestive attacks would occur after most meals”.",qs149s,Philadelphia 76ers,Toronto Raptors

Fred made the clutch shot to close it out but him and OG also shot us out of having the lead. Can't keep freezing Scottie out of the offense every game.

edit: maybe a coincidence or not, but at this point of the season 10 yrs ago during the 2011-12 season was also a struggle at this point of the season, where we went 6-7 and stayed at mediocrity until Linsanity happened weeks later.

"7-in-a-row.

To be 8-3 and 2nd in the West when Ayton has been out for a lot of the season, along with two important rotation pieces in Cam Johnson and Shamet kind of struggling and/or not being consistent is pretty huge.

To sum it up, the Suns are racking up wins and staying at or near the top of the Western Conference (despite being very overlooked as a whole) despite not playing the best in the sense that important players are either not playing or struggling a bit is huge and says it all about how strong this team really is.",qss17l,Phoenix Suns,Memphis Grizzlies

"This sub loves piling on the Lakers, but why is no one talking about the defending Western Conference Champion Suns being 1-3?

I didn’t realize until now that the Suns are currently 1-3.. why is no-one talking about this?

They lost to a mediocre Kings team a couple days ago and nearly lost by 30 pts to the Trailblazers with a struggling Damian Lillard. And from what I know they’re just about fully healthy.

For anyone actively watching the Suns this season, what’s the main reason for the early season struggles? You would think they’d have a bunch of momentum to start the season after their amazing Finals run..",qss17l,Phoenix Suns,Memphis Grizzlies

">Here's your Dallas Mavs Post Game Summary. Now in our 6th Season. 6️⃣

Did the Mavs win? ✅ Honestly one of our better wins of the season. 

Luka had his first triple double tonight with 32/12/15/2 with half of those dimes going to KP. Funnily enough shot just as good from 3 as he did from the FT line with 6 3's. 🔥🇸🇮👌💦

KP with his best game so far this season and his best half as a Mav with 23pts in the first half. Finished with 32/7 with 3 3's and 2 of em being from the logo and one of those logo 3's capping off his red hot half. Also had 3 recorded blocks (felt like he had more than that tbh). 🔥💦🦄🇱🇻✋✋✋

Doe Doe with 15/7/3 with 3 blocks & 3's 👍💦

Bench Analysis 💺⤵️

Brunson Burner adds to his 6MOTY campaign with 17pts tonight to lead the bench in scoring ♨️👍💺

Frank with a solid 2 3's 👌💺💦

Reggie with 7/4 & 2 steals  👍💺

Overall a much needed win to bounce back from the loss again Chicago on Wednesday. We don't play until Monday against the Nuggets ⛰️",qsskmr,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs

The mavs are looking way better then i thought with the way y’all talked about them,qsskmr,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
I was told Luka has a bad +/-!,qsskmr,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
This is what us Mavs fans want KP needed to be in their last 2 first rounds with Luka.,qsskmr,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Idk how but I really appreciate that we’re above .500 beginning the season.,qsskmr,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
Behind Luka's 32/12/15 wtf is this title man,qsskmr,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs

Spurs have like 100 guards. Good on KP on actually dominating these little guys for the first time in history,qsskmr,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs
"This team fucking sucks. 

 * Dejounte is literally a shitty team hero. He can't do shit when he has actual competition in front of him. 

 * White is dead. He doesn't even want to shoot anymore. 

 * Keldon has completely regressed. Most of the time I don't even know what the fuck he's doing on the court until he just bumrushes the paint like Giannis's only move. Only difference is Keldon isn't as big as giannis so it doesn't work.

 * Drew/Thad are decent for what they do
 
 * Bryn is irrelevant. When he fucks up Pop doesn't even coach him anymore. 

 * Lonnie is a bust. He's starting to become Bryn 2.0. I'm sure in a season or two he'll go to a different team and win a ring. 

 * Devin is the only good player left on this team and the only reason is because his 3 is propping him up.

The only good things about this game was listening to Beadle talk about everything *but* the Spurs and Luka trying to fall into that young girls shirt. Fuck the Spurts.",qsskmr,Dallas Mavericks,San Antonio Spurs

They started so hot

Reddish was balling

I understand that they have a hard schedule to start the year, but if they are truly a top tier talent of the east then they should at least be beating some of these teams in a close game and especially not double digit losses.

First quarter was strong. LaVine was great and Caruso played good defense. 29-23 was an ideal start 

We got our scores by 12 in the second quarter. Not disastrous but bad. 

Third quarter was a disaster. Could barely score outside free throws. So many dumb turnovers and we couldn’t stop them at all defensively or on the offensive glass 

Fourth quarter mostly kept it even, got some nice plays but Curry hit 40 easily 

Ugly game from us, hopefully a wake up game. LaVine went too long without a shot and turning it over way too much, Demar and Lonzo went ice cold, we couldn’t get boards at all and defense wasn’t as good as usual. We need Vuc back badly and man I wish PWill wasn’t hurt. Will say the turnovers and some open missed shots hopefully won’t happen again. 

But man the warriors are even better than I predicted which was as WCSF. All this without Klay and Wiseman, so damn good. Looney is a better defender than I credited him for, Draymond is the same old guy, and Steph is the MVP.",qsu8e3,Golden State Warriors,Chicago Bulls

The only way to beat the Warriors… Be the Memphis Grizzlies,qsu8e3,Golden State Warriors,Chicago Bulls
"Curry came in to this game on a mission, phenomenal all around game from the Chef, (his defense in particular stood out today imo)

Kuminga's one on one D is impressive for a rookie, multiple Bulls players tried to take him off the dribble only to call for a screen to force a switch, showed off some nice handles and finishing ability too

Warriors started heavy trapping/Box and oneing Lavine in the 3rd quarter and the Bulls had no answer for it, led to the warriors clamping the Bulls in the 3rd and going on that massive run

GPII is such a difference maker for the Warriors, insane he almost didnt make the roster for the corpse of Avery fucking Bradley

Bulls need to do a better job getting good looks for Lavine, he's their best player he shouldnt have to work so hard for looks all the time, Warriors run specific sets and plays to get Curry open looks too get in rhythm, Bulls should look to do the same for Lavine.  

Lavine also needs to work on his body language when shits not going right, if the best player on the team starts hanging his head and giving off negative body language it hurts the rest of the teams morals, which in turn hurts the teams ability to stabilize or come back

Lonzo might be the most hot and cold shooter ive ever seen, dudes either 6-9 or 1-9 from three, very little in between, he also lack other scoring options, so if he aint hitting hes pretty bad on offense

Bulls fought hard but were undermanned, No Vuc White or Williams (3 out of 5 potential starters) is hard to overcome, they're a legit team imo, just going through some growing pains rn.  

Oh and for all those people talking about how the warriors havent played anyone/they just got lucky, good teams take care of business, Lakers dropped 2 too OKC, Utah dropped one to the Magic, etc

EDIT:  oh and Lavine needs to stop forcing it through double teams, just ends in a TO almost every time, Donovan has to do a better job prepping the team to handle Lavine getting doubled cuz its gonna happen a lot",qsu8e3,Golden State Warriors,Chicago Bulls

KAT is what AD thinks he is,qsupbw,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Lakers
Wtf even happened here,qsupbw,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Lakers
"I'm gonna defend the Lakers a bit here, it's tough to win in the modern NBA if one team is shooting lights out on threes (like KAT hit a off balance buzzer beat three with 0.5 left on the clock wtf) and the other team is bricking everything.  Yes they probably should've switched up their strat but momentum is so big in a NBA game and it's so easy to try to decide games by a shoot out.  We lost to Orlando in the same fashion because we went cold & they went hot at the right time.  

With that said this Lakers team doesn't play like a team of veterans.  They make so many dumb mistakes such as the 8 second back court call, the flagrant by Melo, Westbrook not attacking the switch on KAT, and the countless number of dumb turnovers they had.  They need Lebron back badly. 

I'm also confused on why they went away from AD when we had Vando defending him in the 3rd.  Felt like they could've abused that match up by giving AD easy buckets under the rim like they did in the first half.",qsupbw,Minnesota Timberwolves,Los Angeles Lakers

"The Jazz have to be the best team in NBA history at making a comeback run that falls short because there wasn’t another minute remaining in the game. From memory we did that against Minnesota twice, Golden State, New Orleans, Washington and game 1 vs Memphis last year, as well as twice now against Miami in 2021-22. 
  
It really sucks because it means that it's less of a player/roster construction issue and everything to do with the effort levels the team plays with.",qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
"Fantastic to see Duncan find his groove again after such a rough stretch.  He looked more eat ease out there and wasn’t trying to rush everything.

GG Jazz, got some weird deja vu with that fourth quarter there.",qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
Am I the only one that thinks it’s amusing how both teams’ fans are complaining about opposite problems. Starting strong/finishing weak vs starting slow/finishing strong… Maybe we’ll meet in the finals and do it 7 frustrating times in a row. Gg Jazz,qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz

So fucking glad we don't play the Jazz more times in a season...,qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
Reports of Duncan's death were greatly exaggerated,qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
"Good game by both teams. Jazz made the Heat work for this win lol. Honestly ill take a “sloppy win” like this after the past 3 game on our roadtrip. Robinson came out of his slump. Jimmy is hurt and Bam seems to be hurting somewhat.

Also...it’s good practice for the playoffs anyway. Most games will go down to the wire. Might as well get used to that level of pressure.",qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz

Was there a single highlight posted I honestly didn't even know this game was playing.,qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
"Last year the Jazz shot 39% from 3 as a team and made the most 3s per game of any team in NBA history. 

So far we’ve hit 39% or better in just 2 games this year, both against the hawks (39% one game and 41% the other) and are at 32% as a team on the year. I know league-wide shooting has been down, but the Jazz seem to have been hit the hardest. I came in to the year thinking this would be a 60+ win team, but with such a sharp drop off from deep for a team that takes the most in the league, we’re probably looking at closer to 52-53 wins and another second round exit unless Mitchell, Bojan, O’neale and Clarkson find their shots again.",qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
"It's kind of wild that the Jazz are only ~~1~~ *2* game*s* ahead of the Thunder now.  I know it's early and probably won't stay that way for long but that's still not a thing I expected to see at any point in the season outside of the first week.

**e.** oops, bad math.  Jazz are 2 games up on the Thunder, my bad.",qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
"Glad we played better in the end, but man we had an awful first three quarters",qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
Great road win especially without Jimmy,qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
Nobody blows leads like Miami. This team is killing me,qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
"Not as flashy without the big numbers, but PJ had a great game. And that was a bullshit moving screen call against him at the end, refs had been letting worse screens than that go all game.",qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
Get rid of intentional fouls in transition,qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
What's up with Jimmy? When's he coming back?,qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
No 20 point lead is safe this season unless you're playing the Lakers then it's pretty safe.,qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz
Jazz are pretty bad no cap,qteb6o,Miami Heat,Utah Jazz

Well Pis Boys - it was a good game. I really like the announcers you guys have - very unbiased,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors

At least Pascal had a good game,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors
Not about the game but why is there a picture of Paul George lol figured it would be idk a Raptors player or Pistons one,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors
Way too many missed free throws. Overall bad team defense and Coach Casey working his voodoo on his former team. Good to see Pascal play well and Cade Cunningham is pretty clutch.,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors
30th rank fg% shoots 53% against us. IDK why they always play like that against us,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors
Our defense really sucks without Fred there to run it for us like Lowry used to,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors
Wow. Cant believe Pistons just scored 127 in regulation after struggling so much against the Cavs a few days ago. If Cade gets it going they will improve immensely.,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors

Off topic but Cade really needs to get some accessories. Doesn't have the body aesthetic to be running around the court bare like that. Just get a shooting sleeve or leg sleeve or something,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors

Move Canada to Seattle they don't deserve a country,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors
"4 lessons we learned about Raptors (and already kind of knew)

1. Chris Boucher is terrible...He looks like a different player this year and the fact that Nurse continues to give him any significant minutes is a head scratcher..
2. They desperately need to trade for a starting center, they are being bullied in the paint and it's costing them defensive rebounds...
3. Banton should start over Goran Dragic on nights that Freddie is resting, Dragic actually had a decent game tonight but Bantons energy, defense and ability to create his own point by driving to the rim is more valuable, it's clear that when he's on the floor everyone game is elevated...the same can't be said about Dragic..
4. Nurse has to get Barnes more involved in the offence, especially when we are down in a shooting slump, teams are starting to double cover him but it doesn't seem to phase him and good things happen when Bares is driving to rim or shooting jumpers in the post, I suspect Nurse was trying to give the vets an opportunity to pull this one out...that didn't happen...",qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors
Raptors FTs were ugly.,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors
We need to make Barnes shoot more. Even Dragic took more shots than him,qtgkoc,Detroit Pistons,Toronto Raptors

My girlfriend really likes KAT and pestered me into drafting him with my first pick in fantasy this year over Giannis,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
"The better LA team beat the wolves at staples




Also, shoutout EG the prophet!! He’s eating good tonight",qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
Anthony Edwards is going to singlehandedly turn this team around in 2 years time. Just give him time. He's the one.,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
Does this mean the clippers beat the Lakers by 40?,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
Brian Sieman with the bailout from Big Government call!,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
Paul George wInning games with hartenstein and Eric Bledsoe. Not getting the credit he deserves,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
The last couple nights really show the duality of Kat. Hes too talented for this to happen,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
Glad I slept through this entire game. What a shit show.,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
So this is what the Lakers felt last night...pain,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Using the Timberwolves as the control. 

Warriors > Clippers > Lakers",qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
KAT always seems to have games like this after monster efforts where he would just float and be invisible.. like a day off game,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
The superior LA Team,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
Anthony Edwards is painful to watch sometimes lol. Dude has never met a shot he doesnt like.,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
A real LA team would never lose to the wolves,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Very very casual fan here, where's Kawhi?",qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
"To all the soft ass Lakers fans, that's how u fucking beat a Timberwolves team😈",qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
KAT is one soft ass mf,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
They should trade KAT while he still has some value.,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
"Man, this is the first time I’ve seen the wolves play this year and they looked so bad. Their offense seemed so unorganized and so did the defence.",qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
PGQ3 put it on them last night,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
I miss bledsoe,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
Kat playing 30 mins+ with single digit points and rebounds? Ouch,qtj2df,Los Angeles Clippers,Minnesota Timberwolves
Monk is so good man. I was so surprised he signed the minimum with the lakers. He was so clutch for us throughout last year,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Every single fucking game a scare at the end. Why can't we just win normally man,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
No bazemore or dj and good things happen,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
THT is real good,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Having THT and Monk for like 13mil total is nice,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"Keldon Johnson was my pick for MIP this year, glad to see him playing well",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Nice debut for THT,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"Russ needs to realize that when shot clock is down to couple seconds*, him attempting a shot will hurt less than him attempting a risky pass that usually leads to turnovers, even if he’s going to brick it

*Edit: that’s if the ball’s in his hands",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
What a difference THT makes to this team.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
THT can really get to the rim seemingly at will. Kinda annoying to see him still contort his body every which way to shoot with his right after practicing nothing but left handed shots for two months tho lol,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Much better game by the Brodie but the turnovers man… THT and AD lookin like 2020,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"Melo turning into tatted Klay Thompson has been my favorite development this season

Stay Me7o",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"I’m just here to simp for Dejounte Murray. 

Another triple double!",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"so nice to have an actual wing back in the rotation. THT looks better than last season, good to see him back. good win!!",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
LeBron has never been on a team where he could sit and they win games,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Dejounte Murray is nice af,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Everybody is talking about THT but none of you will give credit to Bazemore and DJ for deciding to be in street clothes instead of playing,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"Not gonna lie, thought for sure Lakers were gonna throw that lead lmao",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Hopefully Nunn comes back soon too,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Anthony Davis is good at playing basketball.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
That Anthony Davis  guy is pretty good for a player this sub shits on constantly.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Good to see THT back in the lineup and even better because I won't have to watch Blazemore on the floor anymore.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
THT DYNAMITE,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Seeing THT thrive makes me so happy.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"I think it's interesting to see Westbrook shooting around 35% from the 3 in his last 10 games. Tbh I think he needs to shoot the 3 more, not less.",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
THT looked good,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
AD is a scary man when he’s on fire,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"I know you can say this about any team missing key players, but damn do we need Jakob. Apart from Dejounte he’s out most impactful player.

AD absolutely eviscerated us inside, and Jak is one of the best interior defenders in the game

at least Keldon is starting to get his 3 pointer dialed in, we will need that!",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
I would like to take this time to remind people that THT is only 20 years old,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
We're not going to lose many games when we shoot 48% from 3. Westbrook played well relative to that disaster against Minnesota. This is what you want from him after a bad game. Just flush it and bounce back with a better game. I really believe in this team when they're fully healthy. But I don't know if they'll be fully healthy long enough.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
My mans THT has a hairline like that of Stephen A. Smith's,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
THT nice asf,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Lakers 8-6 irl….but 1-13 on nba tweets,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
So happy THT is back :D,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
AD was so sick of Westbrook that he decided to show him how to playmake,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Dejounte Murray is special,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
game ball goes to THT,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
This Anthony Davis guy is pretty decent. Potential to be an All Star,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
THT handling the ball over Russ in the clutch should tell y'all everything,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Anthony Davis was a monster this game,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Vogel made THT run point after the Westbrook turnover in the last 2 minutes. Has Vogel lost faith in Westbrook?,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"I apologize to Laker fans. I can see now why they chose THT over Caruso and it makes perfect sense for what they're doing.

Vogel using him to not let Russ handle the ball during crunchtime was genius. That adjustment won them the game.

He might end up being a steal with that contract.",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Lakers finally got some decent contributions from their role players.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Tfw you're competitive in every game but are still on track for a top 10 pick,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Doug McDermott’s on the Spurs?,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Come on guys. Pop only needs like 21 more wins.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
WEllington played so well this game,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"*Sad Spurs Noises*

But Also, Lottery Here We Come!",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
God damn Murray looks great.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
TANK RACE TRAIN GOING CHOO CHOO BABY,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
There’s a real chance Pop doesn’t get the 23 wins he needs this season to break the record for most wins by a coach. I wanted to see him get it this year.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"For the love of God just keep the ball in THTs hands and away from Russ’s. 

THT went out, Spurs go on a run caused by mistimed shots and turnovers.

THT comes back in, Lakers seal the game.",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Now y’all see why THT for Lowry wasn’t on the table lol kids a baller.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"lakers really can't get an easy win, huh",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Only big I’ll accept that is better than AD is jokic. AD is a fucking monster,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Thank god bazemore not gonna sniff the court anymore with THT back.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Oddly enough I feel more comfortable watching THT being the primary ballhandler than Westbrook..,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"I have missed THT. That’s my 20 year old. If we can just get Nunn and Reaves back soon, things will be looking up.",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
wow really impressed by the spurs for hanging in there and making a comeback. they have a great future,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
looking forward to tmrw's game vs Bulls. I need to see Lakers go against good teams to see how good or bad they really are.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Lakers cant let teams think even if theyre down by 10-15 they have a chance to catch up!! Also every game being tight this early in season will be bad for AD lebron with injuries,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"I genuinely believe the melo signing was the most critical move the Lakers made this off-season. crazy that I'm saying this now, but he will be the difference maker for winning the ship. his production on the min is insane. Lakers definitely got bailed out",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Hey that Taken Horton Tucker kid is pretty good.. it's almost like the Lakers decided to keep him for a reason. Crazy,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"“made it a little more interesting than they had to” 

perfectly describes the lakers this season.",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"Is Lebron going to be back tomorrow, or is he too scared of Alex Caruso?",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
THT with the 17 pts and team high +14. Also handling the ball in the clutch over Westbrook.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"This is my kind of tank game, young guys got their stats despite the loss. Hate to think the losses are crushing their morale, but I think it’s for the best. Can’t rely on free agents to come to SA, we need a top draft pick literally more than we ever have",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
I have tried to be patient until THT comes back and have been roasted in here every time. They paid the man for a reason. He has star potential. He is YOUNG.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Every time I watch a lakers game I laugh out loud at officiating,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
So if your player gets hit in the head and then two other guys from the other team come and shove him and bully him it's a tech on YOUR player right?,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Good win for the lakers,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"Our team sucks so bad, we can’t hold a lead to save our lives.",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Lakers got lucky Poeltl was out,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"Is it just me but i feel like the Lakers has barely played against really good teams? When I look at the scores, it's always teams like Houston, Wolves, and Spurs",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"I wanted the Lakers to be good, I am with them whether they winning or loosing, but this team is not good. They are not happy while they are playing, it seems like they just suffer. A W is a W, but untill now they did not beat nobody easily or by a big margin. We should search for partiall sucecces like THT can ball or Malik can go off too, but at the end of the day they still remain unfunctionally. Hope they will improve, let's go boyyys!",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
I know I’m late but odd to see a player with 34 and 15 but have a +/- of 0 lol. The neutral efficient,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
I miss DeRozan so fucking much,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
"Russ should see 0 minutes in the clutch. 

His decision making is god damn awful.",qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Got excited we were about to see another Lakers Giga choke but they closed it out well.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Thank god we beat the Spurs than would’ve hurt more than losing to the wolves. Tht 📈 like what he brings plays with patience doesn’t force drives.,qu1kq7,San Antonio Spurs,Los Angeles Lakers
Trae was incredible on this one! GG hawks,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"Okay, so hear me out here.

I think a lot of situations in basketball are just miscommunication. Like in the Lakers/Suns series, Vogel told Schröder he needed to ""burn Bridges"". We all know what happened next.

In that same vein, Nate McMillan before the year started told our squad he wanted ""Only wins at home."" unfortunately, we seem to have misinterpreted this statement in a similar way.",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"I can finally, once again, [roll the clip](https://streamable.com/va6yei)",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Just to be clear there's nothing wrong with losing to the Hawks.,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Best the Hawks have looked since the opener vs Dallas. Hope they can get a good stretch now that the schedule lightens up a bit.,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"Idk if anything was different schematically, but that looked so much more like the team I saw last season than in any game this year. Finally started shooting threes again",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Gonna be hard to sit down tomorrow after that ass whoopin,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"Trae needs have a new shoe come out every game. He absolutely killed it.
Amazed at how good John Collins has become, improves every off season. Really a complete player now.",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Y’all said trae young was a foul merchant 😂,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
What a way to end that horrible losing streak. Hopefully we can build off this,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Bucks need to get their team back man.  Having half the roster out is putting them in a bit of a hole,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
it's almost like trae young is an elite talent who can score in ways other than free throws but idk maybe i'm wrong,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"last 5 games trae has averaged 31.6 points, 52% from 3, 53% from the field, and 9.4 assists",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"Trae the last 5 games played like an MVP

Now finally his team actually shows up lol",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
All I'm saying is we have our 1st round pick this year 👀,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
This Trae Young kid may be pretty good.,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Trae moves to 10-4 and the Hawks move to 5-9,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Trae is so much fun to watch!!,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Trae not getting his career high in 3's was the most disappointing thing about this game as a Hawks fan. Boy that was fun hopefully we can continue to play that well for the rest of the season.,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"Bucks are championship contenders as defending champions until they give it up. Hell they even have more of a chance to get a playoff spot this year because play-ins make it so they just need a top 10 spot.


Personally...I’m not underestimating Giannis or the Bucks when they get healthy. Giannis is in the KD/Lebron tier and won’t give up until it’s all over.",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Your Score < Hawks Score,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
🧊TRAE,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
This is an off note but Grayson Allen has been playing really well lately.,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Bubble tax is real,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
How do we get out-rebounded 34 to 66?????,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Why haven't the bucks got a backup cemter?,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
What are the Bucks doing?,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"How is the Bucks being lottery-bound at the moment basically flying under the radar, compared to the other drama around the league?",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
At what point are we allowed to start worrying about the Bucks?,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Trae is a bucks killer. They win the series last year if he didnt get hurt. 35 pts prior to inj in game 3 and the lead and full control when he was on. Hawks then blow out bucks g4. Theyd be up 3 to 1 if he played at the least,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"Impressive win, might help turn around their season. Bucks what is you doin baby?",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Seriously,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
What’s up with Middleton?,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"Is Giannis' FT% down? Looks like it's regressing to his averages. Man, it looked like he improved so much at the start of the season",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"Damn Hawks, what'd ya'll do?",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
wow didn't know bucks is below .500,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"What’s going on with the Bucks? I’m confident they’ll figure it out, cuz, you know, Giannis, but they have the same record as the Blazers right now, who are a fucking mess.",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Haven't followed the games much but damn why are these two records under 500?,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
"Trae is a bad bad man. On the other hand, why the fuck are hawks commentators still so salty about Steph 😂",qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Told y’all bucks trash,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Giannis -9. I thought he was supposed to be good.,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
2021 championship somehow even a bigger asterisk ring than 2020,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
WHATSUP WITH THE BUCKS this season?,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks
Damn Hawks smokin that Bango pack tonight,qu4i2p,Atlanta Hawks,Milwaukee Bucks

What the heck was the final play supposed to be?,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Soon as Oubre was ejected... I think we all knew.,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"Is Warriors-Hornets the best random cross-conference rivalry in the NBA? Of course, you have the Dell Curry connection. Then there's the LaMelo-Wiseman draft thing. Then you have Kelly Oubre, who left the Warriors for the Hornets on a kinda sour note, and there's also the whole Draymond and Bridges facing each other as two of the best players out of MSU piece. All of this has made for a bunch of really exciting games over the past two seasons, including that one game last season where Draymond got ejected and Terry Rozier hit the insane buzzer beater game winner. Fun stuff.",qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Is this the best day in Charlotte's sports history?,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
What an ending lol. That hornet commentator always cracks me up,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

"Kerr played 3 non-shooters with Looney, Igoudala, Draymond next to Curry and Wiggins the last 5 mins when they were struggling to score. I get Draymond and Igoudala but why is Looney in the game when you’re struggling to score. Plumblee isn’t Jokic.",qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

"Classic case of Kerr over engineering things by playing injured D-Lee in the clutch who shot terribly and a combination of an offensive less Iggy, Draymond, and looney together resulting in a pathetic 4th quarter. 

Poole needs to rethink a lot of things starting with his shot selection 
It’s a cardinal sin to play Iggy at 37 with looney and draymond.

Warriors offense played like a 1-11 team down the stretch.,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
This should not have been this close. A game in which we basically couldn't make anything should probably have been a 10pt+ loss.,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

GG Hornets. Surprisingly a great game. Worst game of the season for the Warriors though.,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
POTG is a close call between Terry “Jump Ball” Rozier or that weird AF dance bit that performer did at halftime.,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
we couldnt hit a 3 to save our lives,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
That fourth quarter was hideous jesus christ,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

"Damn Hornets had a really good shooting night. But their defense was even more impressive. They are growing as a team and hanging on like this shows it. 

Honestly...though the Warriors being 11-2 is incredibly impressive. Especially because their two losses have basically been down to the wire games. 

Also Southeast division is going to be spicy this year. Heat,Wizards,Hornets and Hawks are going to be absolutely fire.",qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

That 4th quarter Warriors lineup had me scratching my head.,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
rofl Steph was still +14. Even when he's booty you still don't want him on the bench for too long.,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Warriors couldn’t hit threes. Couple big missed free throws at the end. It was close game though. Just one of those nights. Oubre getting throw out was fun for me as a warrior fan!,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

Terry with the bunnies then TWO BEAUTIES",qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

"This game wasn't fun at all to watch. Crowd wasn't into it, the Warriors missed a ton of shots and there was just no flow with the refs involvement.",qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Scary hours,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
That awful 3pt shooting really killed warriors. They are now a fake contender after this loss lol,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
F the refs! I knew they wanted the Warriors to lose and proved it by throwing Oubre out of the game.,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
NBA is rigged. Refs ejected Oubre to force the  Hornets to play someone better.,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Great game!,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

"Warriors are a fake team. Signed, a salty Bulls fan",qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
Refs literally throwing the game to Rozier on the jump ball lol,qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets
"Honestly, too many bad play from the Warriors at the end.

Curry being too unselfish there. He could have make that shot, but he gives it to Looney and he missed 2 free throw.

Iggy and Draymond could have force a 8 sec backcourt, but obviously it understandable that they can't make that quicks decision, but Draymond Green getting outjumped by a guard. Come on.

Last play, either try to make a easy 2 or make a 3. Wiggins has a easy 2 there , but he pass it out so I assume he wanted a 3, but DL didn't know that.

It was not a good shooting night for both team.

The refs obviously favor the Warriors this game, but Warriors just don't have a good shooting night to use that favor.",qu5sfs,Golden State Warriors,Charlotte Hornets

First of many times that Portland will be in the BoneZone. Better get used to it,qu6qqg,Denver Nuggets,Portland Trail Blazers
Is Jokic the goat lmao,qu6qqg,Denver Nuggets,Portland Trail Blazers
"If it wasn't obvious before, it is now. This team isn't a championship team. The desire for a championship seems to come only from Lillard. We have an entirely new coach and we are trying a new more difficult offense and defense which we currently suck at. Fans knew we would suck at it from when Stotts tried briefly and gave up. We knew we would lose games as we kept at it and tried to be better. Apparently only the fans knew, because our team is regressing hard. No one is putting in any effort anymore to be better. They play like a ship without a captain, completely aimless. They are just on autopilot and don't seem to care about getting good enough to win a championship, only care if they are winning the current game. Just depressing. 

Either the rest of this team needs to be whipped into caring and learning real determination, or we need to blow the team up and save Lillard's sanity. I know we joke alot about MJ's intensity, but this seriously is a situation where Lillard would be fully justified taking a page from MJ. I simply see no reason for Lillard to return and potentially reinjure himself trying to carry them until the rest of the team shows they can play on their own and care about being a championship team.",qu6qqg,Denver Nuggets,Portland Trail Blazers
"One of the best all around games I've seen from the Nuggets in a while. And that's without Murray, MPJ, and Barton. 

Shout-out to our bench that was fantastic. Bones especially.",qu6qqg,Denver Nuggets,Portland Trail Blazers

"It was a murder. Denver’s second unit lit it up in the 3rd. I’m a little bummed Jokic sat the whole 4th, would’ve liked seeing back to back triple doubles.",qu6qqg,Denver Nuggets,Portland Trail Blazers
Denver having 9 wins with this roster is crazy to me. Every uear its a straight jokic carry while so many guys are so injured.,qu6qqg,Denver Nuggets,Portland Trail Blazers
This team is disaster squared. We must blow it up.,qu6qqg,Denver Nuggets,Portland Trail Blazers
Our bench was good but the blazers defensee was just awful all around. I saw some early blazer games and though they would be better but honestly it seems they continually need dame to score 50 to win. Our bench isn't that great but that defense made us look elite,qu6qqg,Denver Nuggets,Portland Trail Blazers
Nuggets bench did too good of a job  so Jokić misses out on his td,qu6qqg,Denver Nuggets,Portland Trail Blazers
We don't deserve Dame we looking like a straight up lotto team without him. At least I get to enjoy watching him wear my team's jersey just a bit longer ;D,qu6qqg,Denver Nuggets,Portland Trail Blazers

Derozen showing out this year and I LOVE it,qu8fc5,Chicago Bulls,Los Angeles Clippers
"Bulls have to get better at not committing turnovers when teams double Zach and demar. The offense gets real sloppy when defenses start to switch up schemes. 

And Lonzo had to smooth out his consistency. Dude is way too streaky with his shooting. I think he’s been blocked more going while driving to the basket then actually having makes. Either way it wasn’t a pretty game but a win is a win",qu8fc5,Chicago Bulls,Los Angeles Clippers
DeRozan is fuckin good this season💯💯,qu8fc5,Chicago Bulls,Los Angeles Clippers
"Over the last couple games it's been really clear what Vucevic brings to the team. They have played well in his absence (mark of a good team), but there are stretches where the lack of size in the middle really limits what they can do, especially when only one of DDR and ZLV are out there. Too easy to double the scorer up top and make the others on the floor try to beat you.",qu8fc5,Chicago Bulls,Los Angeles Clippers
Did DeRozan play against the Warriors? How did the Warriors blow out the Bulls then lose to the Hornets lol,qu8fc5,Chicago Bulls,Los Angeles Clippers

"No Love, Markk, Sexton, Allen and no Mobley for the fourth qtr (idc if he shot poorly he was huge on D). Not going to win many games with those outs.",quwy96,Boston Celtics,Cleveland Cavaliers

"good signs for Fox- 9 assists no turnovers

bad signs- 19 shots to get 19 points, just not attacking the rim like he was past two years at all. Super weird, had a legit argument for being the best guard finisher in the league last year and it's not like kings lack spacing. I still need to check tracking numbers against prior seasons, might just be confirmation bias, but doesn't feel like he's attacking at all.

That being said, Kings still have a top ten offense, so maybe its wrong thing to focus on , idk strange year for him so far.",quww84,Sacramento Kings,Detroit Pistons

I volunteer my ankle as tribute,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Its so hard to watch these non-Jokic minutes.I feel bad for him.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
We’ve gotten so much better in clutch games holy shit,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Porzingod back?,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Bullock with the game high +15. 

His minutes were the best for the Mavericks in their last win also.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Kristaps Porzingis has been really fucking good.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
This is payback for the Broncos game last week,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
KP is actually crushing this post game interview.  I somehow just became a fan of him lol,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Holy fuck please be ok Luka,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
And this is why trading KP for peanuts is insanity. He is far better than anything we could possibly get for him. He raises the ceiling if this team so much. What a great performance by him tonight,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Great team chemistry by the Mavs. Luka trusting his teammates and his teammates stepping up. The Nuggets missing some players, but Jokic had another insane game regardless.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Every time Nuggets play, the opponents are looking to go on a run while Jokic sits... And it usually happens. Nuggets' bench is so bad.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets

Jokic is something else... He really is the best center since Shaq,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"B2B good game from KP and this looks promising coz against Jokic

and this is why Kidd insist playing 2 big. KP can hold at 5 but not for entire game. save him at 1st half and unleash it at 2nd half looks good, he holds Jokic few possesions in 2nd half just being tall with 7'6 wingspan",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
">Here's your Dallas Mavs Post Game Summary. Now in our 6th Season. 6️⃣

Did the Mavs win? ✅ Honestly one of our better wins of the season. 

I swear our games are always so goddamn stressful (outside of last game. That was stressful just for us for other reasons). 🐎⛏️

Luka with a near triple double tonight with 23/8/11 & 2 Steals. Hopefully he's ok...🔥🇸🇮🦶🏥

KP continues his uptrend with another great outing tonight of 29/10/3/2/1 with 5 3's 🔥🦄🇱🇻💦

Timmy came up big tonight with some big buckets including the dagger 3 off a ridiculous bounce finishing with 19/7/4 🗡️👌💦

Bench Analysis 💺⤵️

Brunson Burner maintains his 6MOTY campaign with 17/2/6 with some big shots in the clutch to keep us in the lead ♨️💺👍6️⃣

Overall a great win to start this brutal schedule we're in for to cap off this month. We got the Suns next on Wednesday ☀️",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"This was our best game of the year by far. Hopefully Luka is ok.

That being said, I fully trust the rest of our team to be able to win games without him.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
But at what cost.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"If I ever see Dwight Powell in a closing lineup, I will go to that Mavs game, get on the court, and bitch slap Kidd myself. This lineup of Brunson/Luka/THJ/Bullock/KP to close out the game was absolutely beautiful",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Joker deserves so much credit for what he us doing with this team right now. Missing Murray and mpj and still getting this team to compete every night with a good record is impressive,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
unicorn,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Jokic can't carry so much weight.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"What a fun game to watch. KP lights out, luka posting up Jokic, THJ with a take over moment, Powel getting worked in the paint, truly a mavs game.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Please be ok Luka.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Isn't a Dallas-Denver WCF matchup what we all really want? I swear, every game between us (except that last one) is just entertaining as hell. 

Please be okay, Luka...",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Jokic desperately needs some help Jesus,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Down 3 starters and were in it until the final couple of minutes. It’s a wasted huge performance by Jokic, but we’ll be just fine when we’re healthy again",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Luka please have my ankles,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"I've had the impression that we arent a contender for The West.

But Brunson-THJ-Doncic-DFS-Porzingis playing like this....",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Frankey Smokes seems to have everything we wanted from JRich and he is on a minimal deal.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
I hope Luka is okay fuck that looked nasty,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"definition of phyrric victory. feels hollow after the luka injury. 

brunson should fill in well in his absence but damn man...... P&T Luka man",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Is the NBA the only sport in the world where schedule losses/wins are a thing?

Such a stupid concept when sports should aim to have polarity.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"I dont want to hear anything, Jokic is the best player in the league right now.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Hoping it’s not a high ankle sprain for Luka,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
I really hope Porzingis stays injury free.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
I was told Jason Kidd is a bad coach,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Could tell they were feeling that second night of a back to back in the 4th, no energy on defense. I'm sure the Mavs had this one circled on the calendar after our last game against them too. Oh well hopefully we can get more of our starters back asap",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Hope Luka is okay,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
This team right now with all the injuries is basically just Jokic and the guys. And yet they usually win. Just on the B2B with so many guys out they just could not make it the end. Nuggets where leading most of the way to till early 4th quarter. Still have to applaud there effort tonight. I'm not sad about it.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Makes me kind of sad to see such an effort by Jokic go for naught however.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
We needed this win badly for our confidence. I get nuggets were undermanned and B2B but still big for us,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
How everything just falls apart when jokic sits it's the reason he leads the league in advance stats. Our defense offence demeanor everything fucking breaks when jokic sits it's honestly insane. Jokic could play with the third steingers and do well but the moment he sits they forget they are basketball players and this isn't la fitness,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"AT WHAT COST? Take my ankle, Luka",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
We beat a good team!,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
The Barton injury is what tipped the scales. Now its almost JOkic alone..Morris is not enough as a second scorer. Last night the bench was super so we blew out the blazers. BUt thats not going to happen on a nightly basis. 3 starters down now...and AG is a defensive guy. SO only 1 scorer. Jokic. I mean we have our number 2 PG acting as our number 2 scorer. Nuggets need to get healthy.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Jason Kidd: 9-4

Rick Carlisle: 6-9",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"if you hear a banshee wail echo in the distance, that was me",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Bench bad. Jokic good.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"As a Nuggets fan I am sad.

As a huge fan of Latvia and the University of Michigan, I am happy.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"MVP with a fantastic play as always, shame the bench is actually terrible.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"I've seen some anemic bench units, but rarely have I seen a bench unit that is so bad that the runs it gives up are soul-crushing and fuck over the starters. I'd say we're down 2 starters to stagger in, but those units weren't that good still",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"GG's Mavs


I really hope Luka will be alright :(",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
When was the last time we had a ten game stretch without a starter injured. 2,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"That back and forth passing thing between KP and Luka was disgusting, unguardable, perfection",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Can the nuggets make a trade and get someone to play with this all time great???????????????,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Who would look worse, Mavs without Luka or Nugs without Jokic?",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
I'm not mad that we lost this game but i am mad about the disrespect that jok gets from refs. Dude gets mugged every time he touches the ball with no calls.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"On a bright side, ""Despite the Loss"" Jokic is back",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
KP's best all-round performance this season. Great defense on Jokic and his shot has finally started to drop,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Luka and Brunson going right after Jokic with fadeaways at the end was great.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"The other day people were saying nuggets deep and bench good.

Are you sure about that?",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Mavs roster seems uninspiring, Luka doesn't seem to be playing anything close to special but Mavs are 9-4 idk what I think of them.

Seeeing good Porzingis is always nice though! One of my favorites when he's not playing badly.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Y’all need to start taking mavs seriously as contenders in the west whither this subreddit likes it or not,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
fuck that did not look good,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Did help arrive for Doncic?,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Also fun to see Bones and Bol get real minutes not in garbage time tonight.,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Bol Bol is not an offensive rebound threat at all. But, I'd like to see him get more minutes.",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"What's this, the Mavs winning against a decent team? Am I still dreaming?",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Am I the only one who gets slight ptsd from these two playing each other? Ya know? Because it was the last game before covid shut everything down,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
Why doesn’t Campazzo play anymore?,quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Malone special! Close game, lets run 5 bench players with no starter... Sometimes I really wonder how can someone be so...",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets
"Not impressed by the Nuggets at all, basically rely on Jokic to carry a bunch of role players. I'm supposed to believe this is a playoff team, I just don't see it",quy4cz,Dallas Mavericks,Denver Nuggets

"This was the ugliest game I've watched all season. Hell, it may be the ugliest game I've watched in many seasons. I get that we were tired on a back to back, but this felt excessively rough from both sides.

I'm probably going to hear whistles in my sleep tonight. God forbid the refs let the game have any flow or rhythm. At least it's over though. All of our suffering can end.

GG Minnesota. Someone post the pasta.",quygvv,Phoenix Suns,Minnesota Timberwolves
last possession was the most timberwolves shit ever lmao,quygvv,Phoenix Suns,Minnesota Timberwolves
Lol KAT had 35 and DLo/Ant still fucked it up,quygvv,Phoenix Suns,Minnesota Timberwolves

I didn’t realize until now that the Suns are currently 1-3.. why is no-one talking about this?


They lost to a mediocre Kings team a couple days ago and nearly lost by 30 pts to the Trailblazers with a struggling Damian Lillard. And from what I know they’re just about fully healthy.


For anyone actively watching the Suns this season, what’s the main reason for the early season struggles? You would think they’d have a bunch of momentum to start the season after their amazing Finals run..",quygvv,Phoenix Suns,Minnesota Timberwolves

did ant really tried to go for a 3 after that board? but anyways gg wolves,quygvv,Phoenix Suns,Minnesota Timberwolves
I'd love to say good game but good god was it not. Sloppy basketball combined with whistle happy bad reffing made it a hard game to watch and not at all satisfying to win. B2B or not this wasn't the win the Suns wanted tonight.,quygvv,Phoenix Suns,Minnesota Timberwolves

Didn't TWolves hire their coach because he's supposed to know how to coach centers? I feel like there have been so many games where you ask why the coach doesn't run a play for KAT.,quygvv,Phoenix Suns,Minnesota Timberwolves
Refs slowing the game to a crawl,quygvv,Phoenix Suns,Minnesota Timberwolves

Y’all call herro bubble boy I ain’t forget that,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
A game dominated by Herro ball.,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
"Finishing the road trip with a W is always great.

Tyler really stepped up during these games without Jimmy.  Having him as our sixth man is so great and it’s lovely to see how he does when starting as well.

GG Thunder, your young ones have some major fight, they’ll be a problem real soon.",quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
That 1st half defense by OKC was legit! They just couldn't stop Herro and Duncan in the 3rd quarter. Herro is +28 in 37 minutes too.,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
Been great to watch Herro backup his talk this past offseason. 3 level scorer now,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
Happy to see Duncan back at it,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
"Nice defence by both teams, it was great to watch. Can't really do much, when Herro is shooting like that and SGA... not shooting like that. Still a nice game tho for us.",quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
"Dort is really starting to put it together offensively, this was his 4th straight game of 20+ points

#LEAGUE FUCKED",quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
TYLER HERRO,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
"Good team win and a good bounce back after a rough start on the Westcoast roadtrip. 

Nice to see a great game without Jimmy and Bam.",quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
SGA had a problem tonight with some great defense by the Heat tonight,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
Herro still ballin,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
"Shai was terrible 

Poku and JRE showed hella flashes 

Roby is our only actual big that takes it up strong

Nice night by Baze 

Dort fucking rocks 

Thunder up",quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
Herro could not be stopped. Dude was automatic from everywhere...,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
basketball,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
That was one of the grossest games I’ve seen in a while. Nice D on SGA and good effort sans bam and Jimmy,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
Damn Dedmon +28 also?,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
D Rob remembering how to play basketball at the perfect time. God bless,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
Get Dort some help for fucks sake.,quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
"Gotta ask the OKC fans.  Is everything at the Arena as terrible as it looks?  Empty AF up top, Foreigner Lip Sync a longs, the half time show was a dude on a black light bike.  It's not really THAT bad is it?",quy2i1,Miami Heat,Oklahoma City Thunder
"These jerseys really blended together for me, it was quite frustrating to watch, especially on rebounds.",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Scottie still figuring out the late game. He needs a go to move.,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
this will get overlooked but OG went completely cold in the second half. I think he shot 1 for 10.,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"Losing sucks, but Barnes/OG/GTJ were good, so whatever

Fun game.",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Scotties welcome to the league game although he still played solid.  CJ is that guy.  Ggs blazers but Scottie will be back.,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"Ruh-roh, we’ve lost 2 straight road games now.",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Petition to play every game at home. All in favor say aye,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
fun game but a tough one to lose,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
I am sad,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"That block from CJ into the Dame three at the end didn’t seal the game, but holy shit it was hype.",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
We got some serious issues to figure out but will take the win,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Gg Portland. OG went cold & Barnes had a few costly turnovers. Dame and CJ made us pay. Fun game to watch though! Miss norm,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
That second half was the most fun I had watching a Blazer game this season. Love that line up,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"Jeez the Raptors schedule has some intense home/road extremes. They've got 5 consecutive road games coming up before then playing 10 of their next 11 in Toronto.  
  
They play back to back on the road before another lot with 7 of 8 at home. That's followed by 22 of 30 games on the road before their season finished with 8 of 9 in Toronto.  
  
After winning 5 straight games earlier this year they've now lost 5 of 6 and I feel like we'll see them make similar runs all season long now",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Larry Nance Jr had an underrated good game. He was 7/7 even though a few of those were dunks.,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Scottie Barnes FT is getting better.,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
CJ with the non-family friendly post game interview lol,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"Seemed like the Blazers couldn't miss a shot from the 3rd quarter onwards.

Barnes/Lillard had some fun little chirping going on

Barnes with a couple critical mistakes in the 4th. Gotta remember this guy's still a rookie despite how good he looks out there",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Barnes with two costly turnovers down the stretch. CJ so far has been the Blazers best player this season.,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"This Scottie Barnes is seriously good.. alongside og.

From a blazers fan",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
All Praise CJ “Fuckin’…Sorry Bout That” McCollum,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
2nd half Raps really fucking suck unfortunately.,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"Tough last few minutes from Barnes, hope he holds his head high",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"That was a wild fucking game. It would've been really bleak if we choked it away after that run in the fourth though, so I'm glad that we were able to tighten things up and close it out strong.",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"Super fun game!

Ngl I really wished we played like that against every other team lol Every starter had double digits for once!

Man.. I really wish Fred can get an All-Star nomination this time around. Dude's been amazing but alas..",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
CJ *Fuckin* McCollum!!!,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Nassir Little and Larry Nance to close it out. Love to see it,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
CJ just took the game over late. Went into point god mode hitting 3s with drive-n-kicks. Nance at smallball center opened things up.,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
[deleted],qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Am I the only one who thinks Birch must have the hands of a greasy toddler? Watching him fumble rebounds and easy catches is absurdly frustrating,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Cj get way too much hate from casuals and some Portland fans,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"McCollum had a night, Nance and RoCo with some good defensive plays, closer than I'd hope but it's giving me faith that the Blazers can turn it around once they've built up some more chemistry with the squad and coaching staff",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Game was over when Scottie got blocked by CJ,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Back to tankathon /s,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Hey Nurse.. How you gunna go to a rookie on the last two possessions when you have Fred who was playing like a man possessed?!,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Siakam walking out of that game a +5 thanks to Fred and OG hitting a gazillion threes but he was utter trash on defense tonight. Everybody beating him off the dribble and he’s getting lazy on the closeouts. Can someone on the team remind him he’s on a max contract?,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"If raps can stay around .500 until February they should be good for the rest of the season. Gives enough time for OG and Barnes to get consistent enough at scoring and then for the team to figure out their roles accordingly. I love Nurse that nurse commits to his lineups for better or for worse. I think he has a winner this time.

From around February on they'll stop having ups and downs and just get better every game, even through the playoffs.",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"Hope the raptors trade siakam tbh, give the keys to Barnes and re-tool",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Raptors are losing a lot of close games it feels like.,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
feels like every team is having a great shooting night whenever it's against the raps. Portalnd shooting 56% and the worst shooting team in the league pistons acting like they are prime GSW,qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"OG with 22 in the first half and only 7 points in the 2nd...

He shot well, but I mean you cant just go cold like that",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
"Raptors fan coming in peace, that Scottie Brooks guy looks really spooky and Fred van fleet can really shoot the ball.",qv0d6e,Portland Trail Blazers,Toronto Raptors
Zach Lavine has never been over .500 for a stretch longer than 3 games before this season.,qv0xxs,Chicago Bulls,Los Angeles Lakers

"Good game Lakers. THT impressed me tonight, first time I've really focused on him in a game. While it was a career night for him, I can see why at 20 years old he would be chosen as an asset over Caruso. Definitely not unreasonable like many are making it out to be. The one issue is that most of the Lakers are old as hell and Caruso would definitely help in the ""win a chip in the next 3 years"" goal. Maybe they're prioritizing someone that can be another offensive threat and floor spacer with LeBron always out til the playoffs and Russ being a brick-layer?

He dropped 17 last game too, do you guys think he's gonna be at least a 13-15 ppg threat this season? How you feel about him as a prospect overall?",qv0xxs,Chicago Bulls,Los Angeles Lakers

They remind me so much of the pre-KD warriors. 110% on defense from everybody, great ball movement, a bunch of guys outside of Curry who can knock down shots. Just an absolute joy to watch as a neutral bball fan. 

Those ~2014-16 Warriors set the standard (for me) for what great team basketball looks like. They're right back at that level right now. They just smoked a healthy (albeit Kyrie-less) Nets team on the road.",qvp8db,Golden State Warriors,Brooklyn Nets

"A lot of people are going to look at the offensive numbers, and rightfully so considering Curry dropped 37 on 19 shots (including 9/14 from three), but the reality is that the tonight's win was because of their defense.

Draymond was yelling at everyone, motivating them to do their job, maintain their vigilant hands in passing lanes, ensure attention to detail and contest virtually every shot the Nets put up. In doing so, the Warriors held Durant to a 6-for-19 dismal shooting night yielding a season-low 19 points and displayed their 3^rd quarter ability yet again stretching a lead at the half from 7 to 22 by the end of the quarter, half accomplished with Curry on the bench after his 4^th foul and causing Durant to miss all of his shots in the quarter.",qvp8db,Golden State Warriors,Brooklyn Nets
"Thoughts: 

The warriors defense is incredible. 

Steph Curry needs to freeze himself and defrost in 100 years so he can play against robots and aliens, because that's his competition.

"Warriors depth was on full display tonight, they run 12+ deep compared toe BRK's 8 man rotation for most of the game (they got a bit desperate toward the end of the 3rd and put in LMA and Thomas)

Warriors may not have a lot of interior size, but their wings are fucking big, Wiggins, Iguodala, OPJ, Kuminga all run 6'7-6'9, leads to them being a much better rebounding team, on both sides, than expected

Kerr's such an underrated coach, mans been slandered too long, COTY frontrunner, at this point i think he uses the 1st half to experiment around and figure out whats working/what isnt to use for the 2nd half

Steph was absolutely locked in from minute 1, automatic from three this game, his best performance of the season imo

Dray was player of the game for me, his defense on KD was fucking sublime, disrupted so many actions/organized the defense so well, dude needs to be in DPOY frontrunner rn

Kuminga is a MAN, so much more NBA ready than the scouting report would suggest, love his individual defense and general awareness

KD had an off game, but the Warriors defended him really goddamn well, smartly timed blitz's/double, lots of pre-switching to deny mismatches on the KD-Harden PnR, and individual brilliance from Draymond, Iguodala, and Wiggins

LMA is unplayable against the Warriors, he just get PnR'd to death, Nash tried it out in the 3rd when Steph sat with 4 fouls and it did not work then they left in to start the 4th and Steph cooked his ass on switches

Harden might actually be the worst perimeter defender in the NBA, the amount of times he gets blown by/caught flat footed is staggering for a professional basketball player

BRK's inability to take advantage of Steph having to sit with 4 fouls was inexcusable, you have too cut into the lead when the other teams best player is out, full stop

BRK offense when KD sits is just grinds too a halt, too much Harden iso with 4 out, looks much better when the balls out of Hardens hands but that requires him too play offball which he wont do

BRK complains for fouls too damn much, like literally after every other play, not a good look longterm 

Refs were utter and complete garbage, shoot them into deep space pls",qvp8db,Golden State Warriors,Brooklyn Nets

"I  have personally said it in the past. Stephen Curry is the most underrated legend the last 15 years in the NBA.

Regardless of tonights game, he has revolutionized the NBA with his 3p% which even by NBA standards its absurd. His efficiency/play making/bball controul is one of a  kind.

I dont get how people even compare him to irving, Steph is above him and its not close imho he is better than Durant aswell. People keep messing up flashiness with efficiency and winning basketball.

He is 33 years old, sticked with his team and the only reason we propably havent witnessed the best dynasty basketball has ever seen its injuries.(And these are not WHAT if injuries...we know what  Klay and steph can do together).

He is above KD as far as i am concerned and it will be extra juicy to see what unfolds after KD's latest likes on some tweets",qvp8db,Golden State Warriors,Brooklyn Nets

-Run, hide, 3rd quarter Dubs are coming.

-If you run iso against the Warriors, you're done. The help defense and rotations are great.

-Deepest team in the league, everyone plays and we're down two starters. Another yikes.

-I need to see D Lee knock down a 3 soon or I'm going to start thinking bad thoughts.

-Durant looked slow tonight, don't know what's up there, but I'd expect a better performance next time.

-Curry on the inside track for MVP and it's not that close.

"You can say so much about the Warriors, but watching the full game after watching some other ""contenders"" play over the last couple of weeks, one thing stands out: the culture mid game is just different.

When someone gets beat, someone is always running over to help, even if it is futile or they are not even close. The Nets had sooo few easy buckets until garbage time, because the Warriors not only have speed but they swarm people, constantly. Even with a little less speed their defense would be great, because everyone is hungry. The new foul rules reward this mindset even more than before, and the Warriors take that defensive energy and translate it into a hungry offense. 

They will give up some 4th quarter leads playing so hungry, but they will blow people out a lot. They are having fun blowing people out, and that is a scary thing. I get so tired of watching someone on the Lakers get beat and the team lets it become an easy bucket; the Warriors are frantic, wild, and battling. Still not convinced they are for sure #1 contenders, but they are gonna have a great regular season.",qvp8db,Golden State Warriors,Brooklyn Nets

I think LaMelo might be the second best passer in the league behind Jokic.  His assists are resulting in easy buckets for his team.    They're high quality passes and not the typical volume assists.,qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
I haven't had that much fun watching a team for a long time.,qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
Did hornets owner subs in? Lol,qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
Did the Warriors and Wizards really have bad shooting nights or was is Charlotte's LOCK DOWN PERIMETER DEFENSE?,qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
Seeing all this movement on offense reminds me of the glorious days of the previous two weeks of sixers basketball before Tobias Harris ripped them out of my cold dead hands.,qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
"pathetic offensive effort all around, if we had hit even a ""normal"" amount of 3s this game was ours easy",qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
I can’t remember the last time the wizards had a team that could consistently shoot 3s,qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
Brick house game right here,qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
Interesting...result for our division. Going to be an interesting game tomorrow Wizards!,qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards

Wiz faced a team better than .500 and stuggled tonight,qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
We lost this game. Why did we keep shooting threes made no sense lol.,qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
"Ah, to the couch, it is.",qwf2sj,Charlotte Hornets,Washington Wizards
"I know it is said every pistons win but Cade just has ""it"". Down the stretch in a 1 possesion game against a decent team, I don't remember the full sequence but Cade drained a turnaround midrange, dime for 3, layup, another really good drive and dish for 3 (where he floated in the air and read the defender on the perimiter). Then there was the timeout, Cade got a big rebound or 2, and continued to just facilitate and run the offense like a pro. Dude is just so smooth and calm and collected... It also helps when his teamates are finally hitting open shots lol",qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
Alarming to see how important Cory Joseph can be to a team in 2021,qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
I love that we're managing a tank even though we've made like 0 roster moves in 3 years.,qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
"I want to emphasize ""starting"" here, because he's been injured the vast majority of his tenure with us and has a new coach who's clearly installing a new system. That said:

I'm starting to think Caris is just an inefficient chucker. Dude looked only for his own offense second-half and denied Sabonis the ball when he had good position over and over, and seemed only to pass it to someone else once his lane was cut off.",qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
Cade as a career shooter is a good 3 point maker. It’s only a matter of time before he becomes more efficient. His form is very solid I just think sometimes he needs a slightly higher release point but everything else about his game just screams star,qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
"Fire sale time, trade everyone for young players and rebuild",qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
Pacers fell off,qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
When Cade gets that shot going he is going to be an absolute menace. Dude has everything but that knockdown three it seems,qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
"18 points for Cory.

Cojo saw the fanbase talking about him and took it personally.",qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
"why did Sabonis take 7 shots while Brogdon took 18? that seems, not like a thing you want.",qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
"Every week there's a ""Pacers should blow it up"" post on this sub and every time there's a bunch of Pacers fans in the replies talking about how they don't want to see a rebuild and are happy with the team as is. The bar for ya'll must be in hell if this is the team you're happy to watch lol",qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
I hate when my parlay loses so early in the evening.,qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers

God I wish the pistons could shoot average from three.,qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
Myles turner is ass,qwfunw,Detroit Pistons,Indiana Pacers
We look better with Kev as a starter. Also Cam reddish is an enigma. He’s either awful or great. Tonight he was great,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
"Celtics are so weird.

Tatum drops 34 on good efficiency and 4 other Celtics score in double figures....still lose by double digits.",qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
the doubles on trae arent gonna work. he's too good at still drawing up the right play + the rest of our team is actually good and can score,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
Kvon needs 30min every night.,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
Reports of Atlanta’s demise may have been premature,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
First efficient scoring game from Tatum in a week and a half and we lose by 11.  Our overall offense just doesn't have enough firepower with any parts missing.,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
it's all coming together,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
Tatum finally shows up and everyone else stays home. God damn this team is frustrating.,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics

Kev is BALLING,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
"Hawks fans how has Gallinari been this year? On paper such a nice depth piece but not sure if the injuries are just slowing him down. Would he still have a major role on the team come playoff time? If not, seems like he'd be a great trade piece since he could match 20+ mill in salary and the receiving team could erase some salary commitment with his non-guarantee next year.",qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
Our bench just isn't good enough for us to win without 2 starters,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
The Trae Young and John Collins duo is a menace to fantasy basketball,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
My takeaway: Tacko has that insurance ad money.,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
We suck so bad bruh,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
I’m not sure there are 10 teams in the east we are better than,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
"Boston basically dared the team outside of Trae to be…well NBA players tonight. Didn’t work out. 

That was pretty much the strategy in the playoffs. Guaranteed 10+ assists for Trae and if he starts hitting the tough 3s (that he bricked tonight) while you play aggressive defense you can basically say goodnight. They did a really good job on him and outside of 1 or 2 three balls they were all contested. Also forced him into some “wtf” passes.

No disrespect intended, truly, but I’ll never understand why Marcus Smart is as revered as he is league wide. It’s not like his stat sheet was horrendous but all of the actual defensive work was done by Schroeder and Horford while Marcus let all 3 of our wings get hot at different points in the game, which was the actual back breaker considering how well the Trae was defended",qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
You love to see it,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
obligatory fuck the celtics,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
"Here's a fun fact for the Celtics, you are actually allowed to shoot from three when you're open.",qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
This celtics squad is a bunch of losers. Absolutely no heart.,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
"Why is the basketball schedule following the NFL schedule for Boston teams?

Not complaining.  Just think it is amusing.",qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
Hawks are back,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
"Payton Pritchard getting benched until garbage time against Trae Young makes no sense to me. Ime has some splainin to do. This is a matchup that he literally has size advantage, the *only* really good player in the league he can say that about. FVV also the same height but wider

edit: Also John Collins and Cam Reddish are *dudes.* Grant Williams and Josh Richardson are just kinda... dudes.",qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
Marcus Smart about to do something crazy,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
"Remember when C's fans were talking up Langford and Nesmith as non-busts, and how much of a late in the round steal Payton Pritchard was?",qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics

"lesson learned: we are not a good team without Jaylen Brown and Rob Williams

also our bench sucks but what else is new",qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
Really can't expect to win if only 6 guys score,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
Celtics only had 6 guys score this game. If that doesn't show their lack of depth then idk what does,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
Hawks are as good as they are going to get. Celtics missing two starters one who is an all star. Hawks shot over 50 percent and that was the difference. Otherwise stats very similar for both teams. Both teams could be bounced in first round.,qwfr5m,Atlanta Hawks,Boston Celtics
Patty Mills low key is leading +/- in a lot of these games for Nets,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
Gonna be a long 2 weeks for Cavs fans. At least it's coming for hard games so hopefully we can take advantage of a full team against the weaker teams in the league.,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
We played horribly against a decimated Cavs team. Credit to the Cavs for fighting back.. but it should not have gotten to that point.,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"With half the team dead and Ed Davis playing 24 minutes, not too bad.  Showed fight in the second half and made a game out of it.",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"Garland is so nice, he’s gonna have a bright future",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
It's kinda crazy that we have only 5 players in the whole rotation who are a positive on offense and one of them is injured.Blake is shooting 17% for 3 and Bruce Brown is at 30% as well so if 2 of Harden/Mills/LMA/KD are sitting we look rough on the offensive end.,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
Olympic Rubio vs Plympic Patty,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
Is Rubio an allstar?,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"we kept it feeling close enough all game that i just couldn't turn it off despite never once feeling like we'd win.

That wasn't a great performance for the nets. We had so little going on offensively with Garland off the court and will continue to without Sexton as a pure bucket. His injury might do work for his contract. It'll show we need his offense and won't be able to replace it, since we wont have cap space regardless of if or not we exercise his bird rights",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"Outside of LMA, the Nets bench is garbage",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
Bet -10.5 on Nets im so dead inside from this,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"Nets looked pretty not great, good game for LA though",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"I couldn't catch the game but I'm always happy watching KD shooting splits, it's a'so seems like Harden had a good game. God, I hope Claxton will come back soon. Nets are missing too many players with a max contract sitting at home. Gg Cavs, Garland is one of my boys with Rubio. I also hope you get all your starters soon. I miss JA and Mobley is an absolute stud.",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"A win is a win is a win.

FYI, before this game, Jevon Carter averaging 26.4% from the field, and 29.7% from the 3.",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"Nets squandered a 23 point lead that was cut to 6 at one point late, perhaps it was the 2nd B2B game but Harden and Durant were in during the extended Cleveland run too",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"Sloppy win. But I'll take it. Harden showing some life. And LAMARCUS ALDRIDGE! MVP of the game.

^So ^uh ^what ^happpened ^to ^Cavs ^BigMen?",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
Despite that we were missing 3 of our starters we still played well. Not even mad,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
Nets looked like they're just going through the motions right now... which is good enough to beat over half the league.,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"Those multiple two day breaks coming up cant come soon in enough,you could see that most of the team was tired in the 4th,except LMA who sat out the first half yesterday.",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
Very balanced attack from the nets,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
Fuck injuries.,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"I think with Allen and Mobley on the court we win this game, but I could be wrong",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
If Blake shoots another 3 it might be the end of me.,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
"terrible terrible offensive game by the nets after the half. might be fatigue from a back to back after a demoralizing loss but they had an opportunity to have a blow-out by the second half.

Blake's shooting is still rough but plenty of time to get out of this slump. Aldridge and Patty came up HUGE in this game, if they can continue this into the playoffs that'll be useful. Bembry's defense is solid BUT he needs to practice that perimeter scoring. Offense, strangely, is not very consistent or terrifying for the nets without Harris.",qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
Uh oh... The Harden stans are about to come out of the woodwork again and say that Harden is the best player on the Nets (like they were on Twitter and Insta last season)... Stay safe everyone,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers
How though?!?  KD has NO ONE. /s,qwfsts,Brooklyn Nets,Cleveland Cavaliers

This roster is filled with undrafted players. Love to see them contributing on a winning team,qwfy6f,Miami Heat,New Orleans Pelicans
Smart move by the Heat letting Jimmy warm up in the G league tonight before bringing him back. Seems like more and more teams are using that strategy recently,qwfy6f,Miami Heat,New Orleans Pelicans
"Before this game Tyler was averaging 21.9/5.7/3.9

He had a terrible first half, scoring only two points and turning it over like 3 times in a row.

He still went on to just about hit is averages in the second half.

Kid is special",qwfy6f,Miami Heat,New Orleans Pelicans
"Don’t get me wrong, I love being a Pelicans fan but (emphatically points both hands to every scoreboard of a Pelicans game this season)",qwfy6f,Miami Heat,New Orleans Pelicans
"I'm just going to start making insane trade ideas at this point. I'm done for the season.

Let's trade Zion for Ben Simmons 3 firsts and Matisse Thybulle cause why not. 

trade Ingram, Kira, Hayes, and 5 firsts for Damian Lillard. 

Move the team to Baton Rouge and change the teams name to the Red Sticks.",qwfy6f,Miami Heat,New Orleans Pelicans

Ok but now I want to see an SGA NAW backcourt,qwfy6f,Miami Heat,New Orleans Pelicans

I didn't realize until now that the Suns are currently 1-3.. why is no-one talking about this?

They lost to a mediocre Kings team a couple days ago and nearly lost by 30 pts to the Trailblazers with a struggling Damian Lillard. And from what I know they're just about fully healthy.

CP3’s ability to affect the game even on such a horrible shooting night will never cease to impress me. He really is the point god.

DBook is an All-NBA player, and there’s no way you can watch these games and tell me differently.

Ayton played very well tonight, he always dominates the paint anytime we play the Mavs. 9-1 in his career against them now.

10 in a row baby!!!!!!! Try and ignore the Suns win streak now, we are about to get real annoying",qwiil5,Phoenix Suns,Dallas Mavericks
"Not gonna lie, that went a lot better than I expected it to. GG Suns, congrats on the 10-game win streak.",qwiil5,Phoenix Suns,Dallas Mavericks

Rest up Luka! Hopefully his knee & ankle both feel better soon 🇸🇮🏥🤞🦶🦵


KP had a great first half with 14pts on good shooting but didn't score till the 4th to finish the night with 21/8/7 & 2 blocks 🇱🇻🦄✋✋

Timmy stepped up with Luka out with 22/2/4/2 to lead the Mavs in scoring tonight 🔥👌💦

Brunson Burner started tonight with Luka being out and in true Luka spirit, had a near triple double of 18/9/9 ♨️👍

Dwight with a worm kinda game of 3pts/13rebs 🪱

That play denying KP the ball in the post towards the end frustrated me because I knew that man was gonna knock it away. No need to post up KP on Bridges, he has enough length to not really be considered too small to guard KP.",qwiil5,Phoenix Suns,Dallas Mavericks

Gotta be better at stopping/slowing down runs.",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Thank fuck,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Lord 47% fg and 45% 3pt and we lost. What a bizarre game. This is why I stopped betting.,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
I think we can all agree the refs called a great game tonight,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Props to the blazers bench and nurkic for coming back from like what 20? 

But seriously what does Lavine have to do to get some respect from refs. Bro can't even drive because he'll just get hacked and no call. Then the two no calls on Lonzo's layups in the 4th were beyond bizarre. It's legit only Demar getting calls and it's ridiculous.",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Blazers played absolutely terrible first half, were down 20 with a +12 FT advantage. It was a beat down. But they were allowed to stick around and to their credit fought their way back. DeRozan went ice cold and Lavine missed an easy one. Oh well. 

We really need some size. + Bradley is young and shows little flashes but he is not a starting NBA center. Vuc can’t come back quick enough",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Wait, how the hell did Portland win this?",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Just needed us last game to boost their confidence...you're welcome Portland...sincerely a Raptors fan.,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"I saw someone post in the game thread that the Bulls not only had one MVP candidate that they had 2, the lead started to evaporate after that.",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Today's games were all so good.,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Well fuck.,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Scott Foster, everybody. Not sure we deserved to win that game, but I can’t complain",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Can't ask for a better look than that for Lavine, and Portland all needs to collectively slap themselves for him being open there.",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
We were so hot for like 3/4 of the game and then just collapsed in the end lmao it is what it is,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Gonna happen when DJJ and Bradley getting fucked by Foster all first half w/o vooch. Portland a good team though gg,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Idk what it is, I just never feel comfortable with the Bulls in tight games. Both our stars fall back to hero ball and get predictable",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Some bad calls, but I won’t blame the refs because the Bulls should’ve won regardless. They rushed their offensive possessions and it’s clear that the bigs on the Bulls are second and third stringers.",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Post-game thread on the first page of the sub, wooo we ballin' now!",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
We got hacked all game should have had like 15 and-1 lmao. Its all good tho GG,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls

The referees screwing over Chicago sports teams. A tale old as time itself.,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"I'm glad I got to see my favorites go off. I love seeing the men in stripes refuse to call anything on one specific player, it really brings a tear to my eye watching them fuck up the games.",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
PAIN,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
I don't know what the fuck that was.,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Lonzo was great but I feel like he has never beat Dame? Dame had a 50 ball and game winner on an And1 on Ball vs the Pelicans in a 20 point come back last season and Dame always lit up Ball on the lakers. Always a fun match up between them and Ball played great defense, it’s like Ball not meant to Beat Dame or sumn lol",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
[deleted],qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Rebounding and free throws DIFF,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Vuc would've helped in that one. Their bigs were doing work,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Larry fucking lance..,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
How the fuck we won is amazing... dame didn’t even played well,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Wait wtf the blazers don't practice?

No wonder we have such dumb turnovers or miscommunications at time, what",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
One thing never fails intentionally leave someone wide open for a 3 and they will mind fuck themselves and miss,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
I request that this thread be removed immediately....for reasons. Got damn...Bulls really blew this one.,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Shots weren’t falling at the end but I’m seeing Caruso with an almost triple double. The dude can ball. Cool to see someone that played exclusively defense on the last game turn around and become an offensive threat the next. Losses happen. And they’ll continue to happen. Props to the winners.,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"it was getting into an intense ending but boy do I hate seeing heroball Lavine. That shot right at the end out of the blue was so unnecessary. I get the idea, but so so unnecessary. Blazers weren't fucking around and held on with tight D.",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
I went to sleep with the Bulls up by like 18 wtf happened,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"Good Game TB, definitely a hard second half to watch after that first half. Way to fight and hopefully that is the spark you all need! Loved our defense, just wish we had figured out your defensive adjustments so we could kept the lead!",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Wow Caruso... 12-10-9-2-2,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Dame still only shot 33% for the game. At what point do you start panicking?,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
The better team lost tonight,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
the way the Bulls are playing definitely is not sustainable. The contested threes are going to stop falling and down the stretch they really do not have it,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"The scoring is flipped way too perfectly from the first to the second half. Refs weren't missing that betting action huh. 

The line was something like -600 bulls at halftime this shit is ridiculous.",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
Coby White???,qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
"after lonzo and caruso (not in scoring though) were big names last time against the lakers, which the bulls embarassed, someone/the NBA just decided to mess with the officiating. i know its just a game. just a loss. but refs were not cool",qwimj7,Portland Trail Blazers,Chicago Bulls
